When I issue this command:
jar -cvf "C:\Users\UNBSJ\hadoop-0.21.0\wordcount\wordcount.jar" -C classes/ .

I do not understand the following error:

C:\Users\UNBSJ\hadoop-0.21.0\wordcount>sh compile.sh
/cygdrive/c/Users/UNBSJ/hadoop-0.21.0/wordcount
java.io.FileNotFoundException: \cygdrive\c\Users\UNBSJ\hadoop-0.21.0\wordcount\w
ordcount.jar (The system cannot find the path specified)

This was due to the stupid way that windows has its paths, thus I fixed it
by using cygpath to correct the path issue.
