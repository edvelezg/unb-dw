                             <Sentence>INTRODUCTION</Sentence>


<Sentence>This short play needs rather a long introduction.</Sentence> <Sentence>It has had the bad
fortune to become a literary problem, and almost all its few readers are
so much occupied with the question whether it can be the work of
Euripides--and if not his, whose?</Sentence>--<Sentence>that they seldom allow themselves to
take it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous piece, not
particularly profound or subtle, but always full of movement and life
and possessing at least one or two scenes of great and penetrating
beauty.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The outlines of the _Rhesus_ Question are these.</Sentence>--<Sentence>The _Rhesus_ appears
in the MSS.</Sentence> <Sentence>of Euripides; we know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or
Records of Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the name; some
passages in it are quoted by early Alexandrian writers as from &quot;the
_Rhesus_ of Euripides;&quot; no passage is quoted under any other name.</Sentence> <Sentence>This
seems about as strong as external evidence need be.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yet the ancient
introduction to the play mentions that &quot;some think the play spurious,&quot;
and expresses the odd opinion that &quot;it suggests rather the Sophoclean
style.</Sentence>&quot; <Sentence>Further, it tells us that, besides the present opening scene,
there were extant two different prologues, one of which was &quot;quite prosy
and perhaps concocted by the actors.</Sentence>&quot; <Sentence>This seems to show that the
Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first time to collect the
complete works of Euripides, some two centuries after his death, found
this play current as &quot;Euripides&apos; _Rhesus_,&quot; but that it was credited
with three different openings and that its style was felt to be somehow
peculiar.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The peculiarity of style is incontestable.</Sentence> <Sentence>It does not to our judgment
suggest Sophocles.</Sentence> <Sentence>It suggests a young man imitating Aeschylus, and it
has a great number of Euripidean expressions.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hermann, who collected
what he took to be &quot;imitations&quot; of early poets in the _Rhesus_, noted
only 25 of Sophocles, 38 of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet,
naturally influenced by his great forerunners?</Sentence> <Sentence>Hardly: because, with a
few exceptions, the verse and diction of the _Rhesus_, are markedly
early in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction direct and
rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly relevant.</Sentence> <Sentence>In Euripides&apos;
later years <Location>Drama</Location> was moving rapidly away from all these things and, as
far as we can judge, continued so moving after his death.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the
_Rhesus_ is a post-classical play it can hardly be honest fourth-century
work: it must be deliberately archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian
spirit if not actually of the Alexandrian age.</Sentence> <Sentence>This is what Hermann
believed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But unfortunately it is not a bit more like our fragments of
Alexandrian tragedy than it is like the _<Location>Medea</Location>_; and, further, if it is
an Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed in deceiving
the Alexandrian critics, detectives specially trained for this kind of
work?</Sentence>

                   *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by accepting the
external evidence as true.</Sentence> <Sentence>The famous critic, Crates, of the second
century B.C., happens to mention--in excuse of what he took to be a slip
in the poet&apos;s astronomy--that the _Rhesus_ of Euripides was a youthful
work.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now the earliest dated tragedy of Euripides that we possess is the
_Alcestis_, B.C. 438, written when he was about forty-six.</Sentence> <Sentence>His style may
well have been considerably different fifteen or twenty years earlier,
and must certainly have been much under the influence of Aeschylus.</Sentence> <Sentence>So
far, so good.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then what of the other difficulties, the three different
opening scenes and the few passages of late phrasing or technique?</Sentence> <Sentence>One
obvious explanation suits both.</Sentence> <Sentence>The three different openings pretty
clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than once after the
poet&apos;s death and adapted by the producer for each occasion.</Sentence> <Sentence>This
happened to many plays of Euripides, and in one case we even know the
name of the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of the poet.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Among other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of
the _Iphigenia in Aulis_.</Sentence> <Sentence>And in this connexion we can hardly help
noticing that the _Iphigenia in Aulis_, like the _Rhesus_ and like no
other Greek tragedy, has two alternative openings, one a dull prologue
and one a lyrical scene in anapaests under the stars.</Sentence> <Sentence>The general style
of the two plays is utterly different; the _Iphigenia_ is most typically
late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had
both passed at some time through the same revising hand.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This hypothesis seems to work well.</Sentence> <Sentence>But one difficulty remains.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We have so far gone on the supposition that Euripides at twenty-five or
thirty perhaps wrote very differently from Euripides at forty-six, and
that the manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of his later life.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There is nothing improbable in this suggestion, but have we any
evidence?</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, a very little, and unfortunately it does not say what we
want.</Sentence> <Sentence>We have some fragments--twenty lines altogether--preserved from
the _Peliades_, with which Euripides won his first victory in the year
455, seventeen years before the _Alcestis_, and as far as they go they
are just in his ordinary manner--a good deal more so, in fact, than much
of the _Alcestis_ is.</Sentence> <Sentence>Let us face this difficulty.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible, lucid, antithetic,
studiously simple in vocabulary and charged with philosophic reflection.</Sentence>
<Sentence>If we look in his extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of
the _Rhesus_, which is comparatively terse, rich, romantic, not
shrinking from rare words and strong colour and generally untinged by
philosophy, we shall find the nearest approach to it in the _Cyclops_.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Next to the _Cyclops_ I am not sure what play would come, but the
_Alcestis_ would not be far off.</Sentence> <Sentence>It has especially several Epic forms
which cannot be paralleled in tragedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now the conjunction of these two
plays with the _Rhesus_ is significant.</Sentence> <Sentence>The three seem to be three
earliest of the extant plays; they are also--if we count the
_Heraclidae_ as mutilated--the three shortest.</Sentence> <Sentence>But, what is more
important, the _Cyclops_ is not a tragedy but a satyr-play, and the
_Alcestis_ is a tragedy of a special sort, written to take the place of
a satyr-play.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is a tragedy with some half grotesque figures and a
fantastic atmosphere.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This is no place for a close analysis of the diction of the various
works of Euripides; but taking one rough test, just for what it is
worth, we may try to count the number of words in each play which are
not found elsewhere in Euripides.</Sentence> <Sentence>The _<Location>Medea</Location>_, a central sort of play,
has in its 1419 lines 103 such words.</Sentence> <Sentence>The _Alcestis_, with 1163 lines,
has 122; the _Rhesus_, with less than 1000 lines, has 177; the
_Cyclops_, with only 701 lines, has actually 220.</Sentence> <Sentence>This calculation is
doubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth very little until it
is carefully analysed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But on the whole it accords with my general
impression that the _Rhesus_ in its variation from the Euripidean norm
goes further than the _Alcestis_, and not so far as the _Cyclops_, and
goes in very much the same direction.</Sentence> <Sentence>I feel in the _Rhesus_ a good deal
of that curious atmosphere, not exactly comic, but wild and extravagant,
which the Greeks felt to be suited to the Satyr horde; the atmosphere
normally breathed by the one-eyed Giant of the cavern on volcanic Aetna,
or the drunken and garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death and cracks
his ribs for him at midnight among the tombs.</Sentence> <Sentence>The whole scene and
setting of the _Rhesus_; the man-wolf crawling away into the darkness
and his two enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness with
his bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king with his round targe that
shines by night and his horses whiter than the snow; the panic of the
watch, the vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess disguised as
another goddess, the thrilling half-farcical scene where the spy
Odysseus is actually caught and befools his captors: these things are
not of course comic, like some incidents in the _Cyclops_.</Sentence> <Sentence>They belong
to tragedy; but they are near the outside limit of the tragic
convention, and would perhaps be most at home in a pro-satyric tragedy
like the _Alcestis_.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting the external
evidence which makes this play a work of Euripides, if we suppose it to
be an early pro-satyric play which was produced again after the poet&apos;s
death by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary.</Sentence> <Sentence>Most scholars,
however, prefer to think it simply an archaistic work of the fourth
century.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On this theory the Alexandrians when looking for the _Rhesus_ of
Euripides found an anonymous play called _Rhesus_ and accepted it for
what it was worth.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Prologues mentioned in the argument would perhaps
belong to other plays of the same name; one, no doubt, to the real play
of Euripides.</Sentence> <Sentence>The rich and severe style may, for all we know--for direct
evidence fails us--be the natural mark of some reactionary archaistic
school about the time of Plato or Aristotle.</Sentence> <Sentence>The same date might well be
indicated by the great interest our play takes in the Iliad, and by its
almost &quot;Alexandrian&quot; use of the gods as ornamental machinery.</Sentence> <Sentence>I cannot
call such a theory improbable; but it really amounts to rejecting the
external evidence in order to place the _Rhesus_ in a period of tragic
style of which we happen to know nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is certainly not confirmed
by the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes or Chairemon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And, if one is to venture into more speculative and subjective
arguments, I find it rather hard to think of any lyric poet except
Euripides who could have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about
the Nightingale in the Watchers&apos; Song; of any playwright except
Euripides who would have ended a play of gallant martial adventure with
the vision of a solitary mother clasping her dead son.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are many
other passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing in the dark that
heralds the entry of the wounded Thracian, and the final passing out of
the army to its certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped
genius than common imitative mediocrity.</Sentence> <Sentence>If a nameless fourth-century
poet wrote this play, I think we should have heard more of him.</Sentence>

                   *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The story of the play is taken straight from the Doloneia, an Epic
rhapsody which now takes its place as the Tenth Book of the Iliad, but
was very likely independent in the time of Euripides (_Rise of the Greek
Epic_, p. 313 f.</Sentence>). <Sentence>The play seems in one or two points to follow a more
archaic model than the version in our <Location>Homer</Location>.</Sentence> (<Sentence>See notes on l.</Sentence> 150 <Sentence>and l.</Sentence>
175.)

<Sentence>In Rhesus himself--the name is said to be the Thracian form of
_rex_[1]--we seem to have the traditional divine king of the Thracian
tribes about Pangaion, seen through the eyes of Greek romance.</Sentence> <Sentence>He is the
son of the greatest of Rivers and the Muse of the Mountain: she is
simply &quot;The Muse,&quot; otherwise nameless, and we are lost if we try to bind
her down to the identity of any Greek goddess.</Sentence> <Sentence>Like many Thracian heroes
Rhesus has a dash of the Sun-god in him, the burning targe, the white
horses and the splendour.</Sentence> <Sentence>Like them he is a boaster and a deep drinker,
a child of battle and of song.</Sentence> <Sentence>Like other divine kings he dies in his
youth and strength, and keeps watch over his people from some &quot;feasting
presence, full of light,&quot; where he lies among the buried silver-veins of
Pangaion.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the uttermost need comes, doubtless he will wake again.</Sentence>
<Sentence>When the Athenians began making their dangerous settlements on the coast
of Thrace--ten thousand settlers were massacred by Rhesus&apos;s people about
465 B.C.: Amphipolis not fully established till 437--they found the
legend of Rhesus in the air, and eventually they thought it prudent to
send for his hallowed bones from the Troad, where they were supposed to
be buried, and give them a tomb in the Athenian colony.</Sentence> <Sentence>Possibly that
pacified him.</Sentence> <Sentence>And his legend in the mouth of the poets seemed perhaps
like the story of his own mountaineers, multitudes of strong men, stormy
and chivalrous, terrible in onset, who somehow in the end melted away
before the skill and persistent courage of a civilised Greek city.</Sentence>

<Sentence>What grave ambassadors prayed not before
Thy throne, what herald knelt not at thy door?</Sentence>
<Sentence>What pride of gifts did Troy not send to thee?</Sentence>
<Sentence>And thou, a lord of Barbary even as we,
Thou, brother of our blood, like one at sup
Who quaffs his fill and flings away the cup,
Hast flung to the Greeks my city!</Sentence> <Sentence>Yet, long since,
&apos;Twas I that found thee but a little prince
And made thee mighty, I and this right hand;
When round Pangaion and the Paiôn&apos;s land,
Front against front, I burst upon the brood
Of Thrace and broke their targes, and subdued
Their power to thine.</Sentence> <Sentence>The grace whereof, not small,
Thou hast spurned, and when thy kinsmen, drowning, call,
Comest too late.</Sentence> <Sentence>Thou!</Sentence> <Sentence>Others there have been

Lie buried; they were true to Troy and me;
And others, yet here in the shielded line
Or mid the chariots, parching in the shine
Of noonday, starving in the winds that bite
Through Ilion&apos;s winter, still endure and fight
On at my side.</Sentence> &apos;<Sentence>Twas not their way, to lie
On a soft couch and, while the cups go by,
Pledge my good health, like thee, in Thracian wine.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Thy way is mine, friend.</Sentence> <Sentence>Straight I run my race
In word and deed, and bear no double tongue.</Sentence>
  <Sentence>I tell thee, more than thine my heart was wrung,
Yea, angered past all durance, thus to stay
Back from thy battles.</Sentence> &apos;<Sentence>Twas a folk that lay
Hard on my borders, Scythians of the north;
Just when my host for Troy had started forth,
They fell upon our homes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had reached the coast
Of the <Location>Friendless Sea</Location> and purposed to have crossed
My Thracians there.</Sentence> <Sentence>We turned; and all that plain
Is trampled in a mire of Scythian slain
Ploughed by our spears, and blood of Thrace withal
Not stinted.</Sentence> <Sentence>This it was that drowned thy call
For help and held me back from Ilion&apos;s need.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I broke their power; the princes of their breed
I took to hostage, made their elders swear
To bring my house due tribute, year by year,
Then, never lagging, crossed the Pontus mouth,
Marched by long stages through Bithynia south
And here am come .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>not drunken with the feast,
As thou wouldst have me be, not lulled to rest
In golden chambers.</Sentence> <Sentence>In this harness hard
I have borne my nights of winter storm that starred
The Euxine into ice and scared the strong
Paionians.</Sentence>
            <Sentence>Long I have been, but not too long
To save thee yet.</Sentence> <Sentence>Friend, this is the tenth year
Thou labourest on unceasing, with no clear
Vantage; day creeps by day, and Ares throws
The same red dice for thee and for thy foes.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Now, hear my vow.</Sentence> <Sentence>Before one day&apos;s eclipse
I swear to break their wall, to burn their ships
And slay their princes.</Sentence> <Sentence>On the second day                          [vv.</Sentence> 449-473]

For this slow help.</Sentence>--<Sentence>May Adrasteia see

Troy free from these who compass her with hate,

One night, and stole her image clean away
To the Argive ships.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, and another day,
Guised as a wandering priest, in rags, he came
And walked straight through the Gates, made loud acclaim
Of curses on the Greek, spied out alone
All that he sought in Ilion, and was gone--
Gone, and the watch and helpers of the Gate
Dead!</Sentence> <Sentence>And in every ambush they have set
By the old Altar, close to Troy, we know
He sits--a murderous reptile of a foe!</Sentence>

His battle-foes; he meets them arm to arm.</Sentence>

In ambush, I will make of him my chief
Care.</Sentence> <Sentence>I will take him living, drive a straight
Stake through him, and so star him at the Gate

Two snow-white coursers gleam against the wan

I stood again upon thy Father&apos;s shore

                                  <Sentence>NOTES</Sentence>


<Sentence>The play presupposes a knowledge of the Iliad in some form, if not
exactly in the form which it now wears.</Sentence> <Sentence>We are not only supposed to know
that Hector, son of Priam, leads the Trojans and their allies (&quot;Trojans,
and Lycians, and Dardans bold&quot;: in tragedy they are also called
Phrygians) in defence against the Greeks--Argives, Achaeans,
Hellênes--under Agamemnon, king of men, and his brother Menelaüs,
husband of Helen.</Sentence> <Sentence>This sort of supposition is usual in all Greek
tragedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>It merely means that the poet takes for granted the main
outlines of the heroic saga.</Sentence> <Sentence>But in this play we are also supposed to
take up the story as it stands at the opening of the Doloneia or Tenth
Book of the Iliad.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed one might almost say that the _Rhesus_ is
simply the Doloneia turned into drama and set in the Trojan camp.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
only other play that is taken straight from <Location>Homer</Location> is the Satyr-play,
_Cyclops_, which tells the story of Odyssey IX.</Sentence>, <Sentence>but it is likely enough
that if we possessed more of the earlier epic literature we should find
many other plays closely hugging their traditional sources.</Sentence>--<Sentence>The Trojans
are camping out on the field of battle, close to the Greek lines.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Hector, always ready for danger, seems to have his tent or log-hut set
up quite in the van, just behind the outposts.</Sentence> <Sentence>In Il.</Sentence> <Sentence>X. 415 ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>he is
holding counsel with the other chieftains &quot;away from the throng&quot;; the
allies are taking their sleep and trusting to the Trojans, who keep
awake in groups round the camp fires; no watchword is mentioned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 5, l.</Sentence> 30, <Sentence>The priest.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>He would be needed to make the sacrifice
before battle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 5, l.</Sentence> 36, <Sentence>The lash of trembling Pan.</Sentence>]--_<Sentence>i.e.</Sentence>_, <Sentence>a panic.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 5, l.</Sentence> 41, <Sentence>Great beacons in the Argive line.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>In the Iliad it is the
Trojan watch-fires that are specially mentioned, especially VIII.</Sentence>
553-<Sentence>end.</Sentence> <Sentence>There is no great disturbance in the Greek camp in the
Doloneia; there is a gathering of the principal chiefs, a visit to the
Guards, and the despatch of the two spies, but no general tumult such as
there is in Book II.</Sentence> <Sentence>One cannot help wondering whether our playwright
found in his version of the Doloneia a description of fires in the Greek
camp, such as our Eighth Book has of those in the Trojan camp.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
object might be merely protection against a night attack, or it might be
a wish to fly, as Hector thinks.</Sentence> <Sentence>If so, presumably the Assembly changed
its mind--much as it does in our Book II.</Sentence>--<Sentence>and determined to send spies.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 5, l.</Sentence> 43 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>The shipyard timbers.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>The Greeks had their ships
drawn up on the beach and protected by some sort of wooden &quot;shipyard&quot;;
then came the camp; then, outside the whole, a trench and a wall.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
fires were in the camp.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 8, l.</Sentence> 105, <Sentence>Brother!</Sentence> <Sentence>I would thy wit were like thy spear!</Sentence>]--<Sentence>In <Location>Homer</Location>
Hector is impulsive and over-daring, but still good in counsel.</Sentence> <Sentence>On the
stage every quality that is characteristic is apt to be overemphasized,
all that is not characteristic neglected.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hence on the Attic stage
Odysseus is more crafty, Ajax and Diomedes more blunt, Menelaus more
unwarlike and more uxorious than in <Location>Homer</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This speech of Aeneas, though not inapposite, is rather didactic--a
fault which always remained a danger to Euripides.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 10, l.</Sentence> 150 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>Dolon.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>The name is derived from _dolos_, &quot;craft.</Sentence>&quot;
<Sentence>In our version of <Location>Homer</Location> Dolon merely wears, over his tunic, the skin of
a grey wolf.</Sentence> <Sentence>He has a leather cap and a bow.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the play he goes, as Red
Indian spies used to go, actually disguised as a wolf, on all fours in a
complete wolf-skin.</Sentence> <Sentence>The same version is found on the <Location>Munich</Location> cylix of the
early vase-painter Euphronius (about 500 B.C.), in which Dolon wears a
tight-fitting hairy skin with a long tail.</Sentence> <Sentence>The plan can of course only
succeed in a country where wild animals are common enough to be thought
unimportant.</Sentence> <Sentence>The playwright has evidently chosen a more primitive and
romantic version of the story; the Homeric reviser has, as usual, cut
out what might seem ridiculous.</Sentence> (<Sentence>See J. A. K. Thomson in _Classical
Review_, xxv.</Sentence> <Sentence>pp.</Sentence> 238 <Sentence>f.</Sentence>)

<Sentence>P. 12, l.</Sentence> 175, <Sentence>Ajax, Îleus&apos; son.</Sentence>]--&quot;<Sentence>Ajax&quot; is mentioned here and at ll.</Sentence>
463, 497, 601, <Sentence>as apparently next in importance to the two Atreidae or
to Achilles.</Sentence> <Sentence>That is natural, but it is a shock to have him here
described as son of Ileus.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the Iliad we should have had &quot;Ajax son of
Telamon.</Sentence>&quot; <Sentence>The son of Ileus is &quot;Ajax the less,&quot; a hero of the second
rank.</Sentence> <Sentence>Scholars have conjectured on other grounds that in some older form
of the Iliad-saga Ajax son of Ileus was of much greater importance.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
father &quot;Telamon&quot; and the connection with Aegina are neither of them
original in the myth.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 12, l.</Sentence> 182, <Sentence>Achilles&apos; horses.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>They are as glorious in the Iliad as
they are here.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cf.</Sentence> <Sentence>especially the passages where they bear Automedon out
of the battle (end of XVI.</Sentence>), <Sentence>and where Xanthos is given a human voice to
warn his master of the coming of death (end of XIX.</Sentence>). <Sentence>The heroic age of
<Location>Greece</Location> delighted in horses.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cf.</Sentence> <Sentence>those of Aeneas, Diomedes, Eumêlus, and
Rhesus himself.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 15, ll.</Sentence> 225-263, <Sentence>Chorus.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>Apollo is appealed to as a God of Thymbra
in the Troad, of Delos the Ionian island, and of Lycia in the South of
<Location>Asia</Location> Minor; the god of Asiatics and _barbaroi_, the enemy of the
Achaeans.</Sentence> <Sentence>This is also to a great extent the conception of Apollo in the
Iliad, where he fights for Troy and is Hector&apos;s special patron.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
sudden ferocity towards Helen in the last strophe is quite in the manner
of Euripides; cf.</Sentence> _<Sentence>Trojan Women_, 1107 ff.</Sentence> (<Sentence>p.</Sentence> 65), 766 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> (<Sentence>p.</Sentence> 49), <Sentence>and
often; also _Iph.</Sentence> <Sentence>Taur.</Sentence>_ 438 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> (<Sentence>p.</Sentence> 21), <Sentence>where her name comes somewhat
as a surprise.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The stage directions here are of course conjectural: it does not seem
likely that the playwright, having made Dolon describe his wolf&apos;s
disguise in detail, would waste the opportunity of making him crawl off
in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cf.</Sentence> <Sentence>on l.</Sentence> 594, <Sentence>p. 63, and at the end of the play.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 16, l.</Sentence> 267. <Sentence>Hector is as bluff and hasty here as he is impulsively
obstinate in l.</Sentence> 319 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>p. 19, impulsively frank to Rhesus in l.</Sentence> 393
<Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>p. 23, and splendidly courteous under the gibes of the wounded
charioteer, l.</Sentence> 856 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>p. 47.</Sentence> <Sentence>A fine stage character, if not a very
subtle study.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 17, l.</Sentence> 284 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>The description of the march of the mountaineers, the
vast crowd, the noise, the mixture of all arms, suggests personal
observation.</Sentence> <Sentence>A great many fifth-century Athenians had probably served
some time or other in Thrace.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 20, l.</Sentence> 342, <Sentence>Adrasteia.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>She-from-whom-there-is-no-Running, is a
goddess identified with Nemesis, a requiter of sin, especially the sin
of pride or overconfidence.</Sentence> <Sentence>In spite of the opening apology this whole
chorus, with its boundless exultation, is an offence against her.</Sentence>--<Sentence>It is
interesting to notice that a town and a whole district in the north of
the Troad was called by her name; the poet is using local colour in
making his Trojans here, and Rhesus in l.</Sentence> 468, <Sentence>speak of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>There seems
also to be something characteristically Thracian in the story of the
Muse and the River, in the title &quot;Zeus of the Dawn&quot; given to Rhesus, in
the revelry to be held when Ilion is free, and in the conception of the
king in his dazzling chariot, Sun-god-like.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 23, ll.</Sentence> 394-453, <Sentence>Speeches of Hector and Rhesus.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>The scene reads to
me like a rather crude and early form of the celebrated psychological
controversies of Euripides.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is simple, but spirited and in character.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The description of Thracian fighting again suggests personal knowledge,
and so does the boasting.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Thracians apparently bound themselves with
heroic boasts before battle much as Irish and <Location>Highland</Location> chieftains
sometimes did, or as the Franks did with their _gabs_.</Sentence> (<Sentence>See, _e.g.</Sentence>, <Sentence>Le
Pèlerinage de Charlemagne_, as described in Gaston <Location>Paris</Location>, _Litt.</Sentence> <Sentence>du
Moyen Age_, I. p. 122 ff.</Sentence>) <Sentence>It was a disgrace if you did not fulfil your
_gab_ afterwards.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Rhesus&apos;s defence is apparently true, though in a modern play one would
have expected some explanation of the rather different story that his
mother tells, l.</Sentence> 933 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>p. 51.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps he did not realise how she was
holding him back.</Sentence> <Sentence>In any case ancient technique prefers to leave such
details unsettled: cf.</Sentence>, <Sentence>for instance, Helen&apos;s speech in the _Trojan
Women_, in which the false is evidently mixed up with the true, and they
are never separated afterwards.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 25, ll.</Sentence> 454 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>This little Chorus seems to represent--in due tragic
convention--an irrepressible outburst of applause from the Trojans,
interrupting Rhesus&apos;s speech.</Sentence> <Sentence>In spite of the words about possible
&quot;wrath&quot; that may follow the Thracian&apos;s boasting, the applause excites
him at once to a yet bolder _gab_.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 26, l.</Sentence> 480. <Sentence>It may be remarked that the play here uses a fairly
common Homeric phrase in a sense which the scholars of our tradition
knew but rejected.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 27, l.</Sentence> 501 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>These three achievements of Odysseus are all in the
traditional saga.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Rapt of the Palladium, or figure of Pallas, by
Odysseus and Diomedes, was in an old lost epic, called The Little Iliad;
the Begging in Troy in the Little Iliad and also in Odyssey IV.</Sentence> 242 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>;
<Sentence>the great ambuscades in Odyssey IV.</Sentence> 290 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>VIII.</Sentence> 493 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>and in
Odysseus&apos;s own feigned story, XIV.</Sentence> 468 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>According to our tradition
they belong to a later period of the war than the death of Rhesus, but
perhaps the sequence was different, or not so definite, at the time of
this play.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 28, l.</Sentence> 528. <Sentence>Rhesus shows the simple courage of a barbarian in his
contempt for the ruses of Odysseus, the brutality of a barbarian in the
methods of punishment he proposes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Such proposals would disgust a Greek;
it looks as if they displeased Hector.</Sentence> <Sentence>In any case his abruptness here,
and his careful indication of the place where the Thracians are to
sleep, far from the rest of the camp, have some dramatic value for the
sequel.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Pp.</Sentence> 28-30, <Sentence>ll.</Sentence> 527-564, <Sentence>Stars and Nightingale chorus.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>The beauty of
these lines in the Greek is quite magical, but the stage management of
the scene is difficult.</Sentence> <Sentence>Apparently Hector (l.</Sentence> 523) <Sentence>bids the Guards come
forward from where they are and wait nearer the front for Dolon; obeying
this they come up from the orchestra, we may suppose, to the stage.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then
watching somewhere near Hector&apos;s tent they partly express, in the usual
song, the lyrical emotion of the night, partly they chat about Dolon and
the order of the watches.</Sentence> <Sentence>The scene is technically very interesting with
its rather abrupt introduction of realism into the high convention of
tragedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Meantime the Trojans&apos; time of watch is over and the Lycians,
who ought to watch next, have not come.</Sentence> <Sentence>In a modern army it would of
course be the duty of the new watch to come and relieve the old; in an
ancient barbaric army--characteristically--the old watch had to go and
wake the new.</Sentence> <Sentence>You could not, one must suppose, trust them to take their
turn otherwise.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the end of the first strophe a Guard suggests that
they should rouse the Lycians; at the end of the second the Leader
definitely gives the word to do so.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Guards go, and so the stage (and
orchestra) is left empty.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This is plain enough; but why were the Guards brought away from their
original position--from the orchestra to the stage?</Sentence> <Sentence>Probably to allow
the Greek spies to pass on towards the Thracian camp by a different and
unoccupied way, not by the way which the Guards had just taken.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The story of the Nightingale is well known: she was Philomêla, or in the
older story Procnê, an Athenian princess, wedded to the faithless
Thracian king, Têreus.</Sentence> <Sentence>In a fury of vengeance on her husband she slew
their only son, Itys or Itylus, and now laments him broken-hearted for
ever.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 31, l.</Sentence> 567 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>Odysseus and Diomedes.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>Observe how we are left
gradually to discover that they have met and killed Dolon.</Sentence> <Sentence>They enter
carrying, as far as we can make out, a wolf-skin that looks like his:
they had evidently spoken to him, ll.</Sentence> 572, 575: <Sentence>it _is_ his and they
have killed him--l.</Sentence> 592 <Sentence>f.</Sentence>

<Sentence>All the Odysseus-Diomedes scenes have something unusual about them,
something daring, turbulent, and perhaps lacking in dramatic tact.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
silent rush on Hector&apos;s empty tent is hard to parallel.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cruel Athena
is Euripidean; but her appearance in the midst of the action is
startling, though it may be paralleled from Sophocles&apos; Ajax.</Sentence> <Sentence>In
Euripides Gods are generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away
from the ordinary action.</Sentence> (<Sentence>The vision of Iris and Lyssa in the middle of
the Heracles has at least the stage clear of mortals and the Chorus
apparently in a kind of dream.</Sentence>) <Sentence>Again the conception of Athena
pretending to be Cypris is curious.</Sentence> <Sentence>The disguised Athena is common in
the Odyssey, but she does not disguise herself as another goddess.</Sentence> (<Sentence>It
is sometimes held that this scene requires four actors, which would be a
decisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so.</Sentence> <Sentence>The actor who took
Odysseus could easily get round in time to take <Location>Paris</Location> also--especially
if he made his exit at l.</Sentence> 626, <Sentence>before Athena sees <Location>Paris</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>And the Greek
stage had no objection to such doubling.</Sentence>) <Sentence>Lastly, the scene of turmoil
between the spies and the Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though
it would suit well in a pro-satyric play.</Sentence> <Sentence>See Introduction.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 33, l.</Sentence> 594, <Sentence>Stage direction.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>They bear Dolon&apos;s &quot;spoils&quot; or
&quot;tokens&quot;: probably his wolf-skin.</Sentence> <Sentence>If they bring it with them they must
probably do something with it, and to hang it where it may give Hector a
violent start seems the natural proceeding.</Sentence> <Sentence>Also, they can hardly be
carrying it in the scene with the Guards, l.</Sentence> 675 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>p. 38 f.</Sentence> <Sentence>That
would be madness.</Sentence> <Sentence>They must have got rid of it before then, and this
seems the obvious place for doing so.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 36, ll.</Sentence> 637 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>Athena as Cypris.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>It is not clear how this would
be represented on the Greek stage, though there is no reason to think
there would be any special difficulty.</Sentence> <Sentence>On a modern stage it could be
worked as follows:--The Goddess will be behind a gauze, so that she is
invisible when only the lights in front of the gauze are lit, but
visible when a light goes up behind it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She will first appear with
helmet and spear in some hard light; then disappear and be rediscovered
in the same place in a softer light, the helmet and spear gone and some
emblems of Cypris--say a flower and a dove--in their place.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course
the voice will change too.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next scene, where the two spies are caught and let go, is clear
enough in its general structure; the details must remain conjectural.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 40, l.</Sentence> 703, <Sentence>What the High God.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>It would be unparalleled in
classical Greek to describe a man by his religion; but this phrase seems
only to mean: &quot;What is his tribal God?</Sentence>&quot; _<Sentence>i.e.</Sentence>_ <Sentence>what is his tribe?</Sentence> <Sentence>Thus
it could be said of Isagoras in Herodotus (v.</Sentence> 66) <Sentence>that his kinsmen
sacrificed to Carian Zeus, suggesting, presumably, that he had Carian
blood.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 42, l.</Sentence> 728, <Sentence>Voice of the wounded man outside.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>The puzzled and
discouraged talk of the Guards round the fire, the groaning in the
darkness without, the quick alarm among the men who had been careless
before, and the slow realisation of disaster that follows--all these
seem to me to be wonderfully indicated, though the severe poetic
convention excludes any approach to what we, by modern prose standards,
would call effective realism.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 44, ll.</Sentence> 756-803. <Sentence>This fine vivid speech has something of the famous
Euripidean Messenger-Speeches in it; though they are apt to be much
longer and also are practically never spoken by a principal in the
action, always by a subordinate or an onlooker.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cf.</Sentence> <Sentence>the speech of the
Messenger-Shepherd above, p. 17 f.</Sentence> <Sentence>An extreme sharpness of articulation
is characteristic of Euripides&apos; later work: each speech, each scene,
each effect is isolated and made complete in itself.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Messenger
prepares his message, relates his message and goes, not mixing himself
up in the further fortunes of the drama.</Sentence> <Sentence>But this extreme pursuit of
lucidity and clear outlines is not nearly so marked in the early plays:
in the _Cyclops_ the Messenger&apos;s speech is actually spoken by Odysseus,
ll.</Sentence> 382-436, <Sentence>and the Serving Man and Serving Maid in the _Alcestis_ are
not mere abstract Messengers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 46, ll.</Sentence> 810-830, <Sentence>Hector and the Guard.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>There is intentional colour
here--the impulsive half-barbaric rage of Hector, the oriental
grovelling of the Guard, and of course the quick return to courteous
self-mastery with which Hector receives the taunts of the wounded man.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 46, l.</Sentence> 819. <Sentence>The Guard seems to think that the spies got past him when
he came to Hector&apos;s tent at the beginning of the play.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was really
later, when he made his men leave their post to wake the Lycians.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Perhaps he is lying.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 48, l.</Sentence> 876, <Sentence>Justice knows.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>It is a clever touch to leave the
Thracian still only half-convinced and grumbling.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 49, l.</Sentence> 882, <Sentence>Appearance of the Muse.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>A beautiful scene.</Sentence> <Sentence>It has been
thought to come abruptly and, as it were, unskilfully on top of the
familiar dialogue between Hector and the Thracian.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the movements,
first of soldiers lifting and carrying the wounded man, and then of
messengers taking word to Priam for burial of the men slain, make the
transition much easier.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 50, l.</Sentence> 895 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence> <Sentence>and l.</Sentence> 906 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>A dirge of the Thracian
mountains.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>Such dirges must have struck the Greeks as the fragments of
Ossian struck the Lowlanders among us.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have found that the dirge here
goes naturally into a sort of Ossianic rhythm.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 51, l.</Sentence> 915. <Sentence>The speech of the Muse seems like the writing of a poet
who is, for the moment, tired of mere drama, and wishes to get back into
his own element.</Sentence> <Sentence>Such passages are characteristic of Euripides.</Sentence>--<Sentence>The
death of Rhesus seems to the Muse like an act of vengeance from the dead
Thamyris, the Thracian bard who had blasphemed the Muses and challenged
them to a contest of song.</Sentence> <Sentence>They conquered him and left him blind, but
still a poet.</Sentence> <Sentence>The story in <Location>Homer</Location> is more terrible, though more
civilised: &quot;They in wrath made him a maimed man, they took away his
heavenly song and made him forget his harping.</Sentence>&quot;

<Sentence>Thamyris, the bard who defied Heaven; Orpheus, the bard, saint, lover,
whose severed head still cried for his lost Eurydice; Musaeus, the bard
of mystic wisdom and initiations--are the three great legendary figures
of this Northern mountain minstrelsy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 52, l.</Sentence> 950. <Sentence>These short speeches between Hector and the Leader of the
Guard make a jarring note in the midst of the Muse&apos;s lament.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps it
would not be so if we knew how the play was produced, but at present
this seems like one of several marks of comparative crudity in technique
which mark the play, amid all its daring and inventiveness.</Sentence>

<Sentence>P. 52, l.</Sentence> 962 <Sentence>ff.</Sentence>, <Sentence>My son shall not be laid in any grave.</Sentence>]--<Sentence>Like other
Northern barbaric princes, such as Orpheus (l.</Sentence> 972 <Sentence>below) and Zalmoxis
(Herodotus, iv.</Sentence> 95) <Sentence>and Holgar the Dane, Rhesus lies in a hidden chamber
beneath the earth, watching, apparently, for the day of uttermost need
when he must rise to help his people.</Sentence> <Sentence>There is no other passage in Greek
tragedy where such a fate is attributed to a hero, though the position
of Darius in the _Persae_ and Agamemnon in the _Choephori_ or the
_Electra_ is in some ways analogous.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The last lines of the Muse have a very Euripidean ring: cf.</Sentence> _<Sentence><Location>Medea</Location>_, l.</Sentence>
1090 (<Sentence>p.</Sentence> 61, &quot;<Sentence>My thoughts have roamed a cloudy land&quot;), _Alcestis_, l.</Sentence>
882.

<Sentence>P. 54, ll.</Sentence> 983-<Sentence>end.</Sentence> <Sentence>This curious and moving end--not in death or peace
but in a girding of tired men to greater toil--reminds one of the last
words of _The Trojan Women_: &quot;Forth to the long Greek ships And the
sea&apos;s foaming,&quot; and the last words of the _Chanson de Roland_ there
quoted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Trojans evidently go forth under the shadow of disaster, though with
firmness and courage.</Sentence> <Sentence>The stage direction is of course purely
conjectural.</Sentence> <Sentence>If Diomedes left some sign of Dolon&apos;s death for Hector to
see, as he probably must have done, then Hector must at some time or
other see it.</Sentence> <Sentence>If so, this seems to be the place.</Sentence>
