<Node id="2595" />CHAPTER I<Node id="2604" />

<Node id="2606" />THE STONE<Node id="2615" />


<Node id="2618" />'<Node id="2619" />Do you mean,' Sir Giles said, 'that the thing never gets smaller?<Node id="2684" />'<Node id="2685" />

<Node id="2687" />'<Node id="2688" />Never,' the Prince answered.<Node id="2716" /> '<Node id="2718" />So much of its virtue has entered into
its outward form that whatever may happen to it there is no change.<Node id="2824" />
<Node id="2825" />From the beginning it was as it is now.<Node id="2864" />'<Node id="2865" />

<Node id="2867" />'<Node id="2868" />Then by God, sir,' Reginald Montague exclaimed, 'you've got the
transport of the world in your hands.<Node id="2969" />'<Node id="2970" />

<Node id="2972" />Neither of the two men made any answer.<Node id="3011" /> <Node id="3012" />The Persian, sitting back in
his chair, and Sir Giles, sitting forward on the edge of his, were both
gazing at the thing which lay on the table.<Node id="3156" /> <Node id="3157" />It was a circlet of old,
tarnished, and twisted gold, in the centre of which was set a cubical
stone measuring about half an inch every way, and having apparently
engraved on it certain Hebrew letters.<Node id="3358" /> <Node id="3359" />Sir Giles picked it up, rather
cautiously, and concentrated his gaze on them.<Node id="3436" /> <Node id="3437" />The motion awoke a doubt
in Montague's mind.<Node id="3481" />

<Node id="3483" />'<Node id="3484" />But supposing you chipped one of the letters off?<Node id="3533" />' <Node id="3535" />he asked.<Node id="3544" /> '<Node id="3546" />Aren't
they awfully important?<Node id="3576" /> <Node id="3577" />Wouldn't that destroy the--the effect?<Node id="3615" />'<Node id="3616" />

<Node id="3618" />'<Node id="3619" />They are the letters of the Tetragrammaton,' the Persian said drily,
'if you call that important.<Node id="3716" /> <Node id="3717" />But they are not engraved on the Stone;
they are in the centre--they are, in fact, the Stone.<Node id="3810" />'<Node id="3811" />

<Node id="3813" />'<Node id="3814" />O!<Node id="3816" />' <Node id="3818" />Mr. Montague said vaguely, and looked at his uncle Sir Giles,
who said nothing at all.<Node id="3904" /> <Node id="3905" />This, after a few minutes, seemed to compel
Montague to a fresh attempt.<Node id="3977" />

<Node id="3979" />'<Node id="3980" />You see, sir?<Node id="3993" />' <Node id="3995" />he said, leaning forward almost excitedly.<Node id="4037" /> '<Node id="4039" />If what the
Prince says is true, and we've proved that it is, a child could use it.<Node id="4122" />'<Node id="4123" />

<Node id="4125" />'<Node id="4126" />You are not, I suppose,' the Persian asked, 'proposing to limit it
to children?<Node id="4205" /> <Node id="4206" />A child could use it, but in adult hands it may be more
dangerous.<Node id="4272" />'<Node id="4273" />

<Node id="4275" />'<Node id="4276" />Dangerous be damned,' Montague said more excitedly than before, 'It's
a marvellous chance--it's ...<Node id="4375" /> <Node id="4376" />it's a miracle.<Node id="4391" /> <Node id="4392" />The thing's as simple as
pie.<Node id="4421" /> <Node id="4422" />Circlets like this with the smallest fraction of the Stone in each.<Node id="4489" />
<Node id="4490" />We could ask what we liked for them--thousands of pounds each, if we
like.<Node id="4564" /> <Node id="4565" />No trains, no tubes, no aeroplanes.<Node id="4600" /> <Node id="4601" />Just the thing on your
forehead, a minute's concentration, and whoosh!<Node id="4671" />'<Node id="4672" />

<Node id="4674" />The Prince made a sudden violent movement, and then again a silence
fell.<Node id="4747" />

<Node id="4749" />It was late at night.<Node id="4770" /> <Node id="4771" />The three were sitting in Sir Giles Tumulty's
house at Ealing--Sir Giles himself, the traveller and archaeologist;
Reginald Montague, his nephew and a stockbroker; and the Prince Ali
Mirza Khan, First Secretary to the Persian Ambassador at the court of
St. James.<Node id="5034" /> <Node id="5035" />At the gate of the house stood the Prince's car; Montague
was playing with a fountain-pen; all the useful tricks of modern
civilization were at hand.<Node id="5184" /> <Node id="5185" />And on the table, as Sir Giles put it slowly
down, lay all that was left of the Crown of Suleiman ben Daood, King in
Jerusalem.<Node id="5312" />

<Node id="5314" />Sir Giles looked across at the Prince.<Node id="5352" /> '<Node id="5354" />Can you move other people with
it, or is it like season-tickets?<Node id="5418" />'<Node id="5419" />

<Node id="5421" />'<Node id="5422" />I do not know,' the Persian said gravely.<Node id="5463" /> '<Node id="5465" />Since the time of Suleiman
(may the Peace be upon him!<Node id="5519" />) <Node id="5521" />no one has sought to make profit from it.<Node id="5562" />'<Node id="5563" />

<Node id="5565" />'<Node id="5566" />Ha!<Node id="5569" />' <Node id="5571" />said Mr. Montague, surprised.<Node id="5600" /> '<Node id="5602" />O come now, Prince!<Node id="5621" />'<Node id="5622" />

<Node id="5624" />'<Node id="5625" />Or if they have,' the Prince went on, 'they and their names and all
that they did have utterly perished from the earth.<Node id="5744" />'<Node id="5745" />

<Node id="5747" />'<Node id="5748" />Ha!<Node id="5751" />' <Node id="5753" />said Mr. Montague again, a little blankly.<Node id="5795" /> '<Node id="5797" />O well, we can see.<Node id="5816" />
<Node id="5817" />But you take my advice and get out of Rails.<Node id="5861" /> <Node id="5862" />Look here, uncle, we want
to keep this thing quiet.<Node id="5913" />'<Node id="5914" />

<Node id="5916" />'<Node id="5917" />Eh?<Node id="5920" />' <Node id="5922" />Sir Giles said.<Node id="5937" /> '<Node id="5939" />Quiet?<Node id="5945" /> <Node id="5946" />No, I don't particularly want to keep it
quiet.<Node id="5993" /> <Node id="5994" />I want to talk to Palliser about it--after me he knows more about
these things than anyone.<Node id="6085" /> <Node id="6086" />And I want to see Van Eilendorf--and perhaps
Cobham, though his nonsense about the double pillars at Baghdad was the
kind of tripe that nobody but a broken-down Houndsditch sewer-rat would
talk.<Node id="6280" />'<Node id="6281" />

<Node id="6283" />The Prince stood up.<Node id="6303" /> '<Node id="6305" />I have shown you and told you these things,' he
said, 'because you knew too much already, and that you may see how very
precious is the Holy Thing which you have there.<Node id="6473" /> <Node id="6474" />I ask you again to
restore it to the guardians from whom you stole it.<Node id="6544" /> <Node id="6545" />I warn you that if
you do not----'<Node id="6579" />

<Node id="6581" />'<Node id="6582" />I didn't steal it,' Sir Giles broke in.<Node id="6621" /> '<Node id="6623" />I bought it.<Node id="6635" /> <Node id="6636" />Go and ask the
fellow who sold it to me.<Node id="6676" />'<Node id="6677" />

<Node id="6679" />'<Node id="6680" />Whether you stole by bribery or by force is no matter,' the Prince went
on.<Node id="6755" /> '<Node id="6757" />You very well know that he who betrayed it to you broke the trust
of generations.<Node id="6838" /> <Node id="6839" />I do not know what pleasure you find in it or for what
you mean to use it, unless indeed you will make it a talisman for
travel.<Node id="6967" /> <Node id="6968" />But however that may be, I warn you that it is dangerous to
all men and especially dangerous to such unbelievers as you.<Node id="7088" /> <Node id="7089" />There are
dangers within the Stone, and other dangers from those who were sworn to
guard the Stone.<Node id="7188" /> <Node id="7189" />I offer you again as much money as you can desire if
you will return it.<Node id="7261" />'<Node id="7262" />

<Node id="7264" />'<Node id="7265" />O well, as to money,' Reginald Montague said, 'of course my uncle will
have a royalty--a considerable royalty--on all sales and that'll be a
nice little bit in a few months.<Node id="7438" /> <Node id="7439" />Yours isn't a rich Government anyhow,
is it?<Node id="7483" /> <Node id="7484" />How many millions do you owe us?<Node id="7516" />'<Node id="7517" />

<Node id="7519" />The Prince took no notice.<Node id="7545" /> <Node id="7546" />He was staring fiercely and eagerly at Sir
Giles, who put out his hand again and picked up the circlet.<Node id="7649" />

<Node id="7651" />'<Node id="7652" />No,' he said, 'no, I shan't part with it.<Node id="7693" /> <Node id="7694" />I want to experiment a bit.<Node id="7721" />
<Node id="7722" />The bastard asylum attendant who sold it to me----'<Node id="7773" />

<Node id="7775" />The Prince interrupted in a shaking voice.<Node id="7817" /> '<Node id="7819" />Take care of your words,' he
said.<Node id="7853" /> '<Node id="7855" />Outcast and accursed as that man now is, he comes of a great and
royal family.<Node id="7933" /> <Node id="7934" />He shall writhe in hell for ever, but even there you shall
not be worthy to see his torment.<Node id="8026" />'<Node id="8027" />

<Node id="8029" />'--<Node id="8032" />said there was hardly anything it wouldn't do,' Sir Giles finished.<Node id="8099" />
'<Node id="8101" />No, I shan't ask Cobham.<Node id="8125" /> <Node id="8126" />Palliser and I will try it first.<Node id="8159" /> <Node id="8160" />It was all
perfectly legal, Prince, and all the Governments in the world can't make
it anything else.<Node id="8261" />'<Node id="8262" />

<Node id="8264" />'<Node id="8265" />I do not think Governments will recover it,' the Prince said.<Node id="8326" /> '<Node id="8328" />But
death is not a monopoly of Governments.<Node id="8371" /> <Node id="8372" />If I had not sworn to my
uncle----'<Node id="8407" />

<Node id="8409" />'<Node id="8410" />O it was your uncle, was it?<Node id="8438" />' <Node id="8440" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="8456" /> '<Node id="8458" />I wondered what it was
that made you coo so gently.<Node id="8509" /> <Node id="8510" />I rather expected you to be more active
about it to-night.<Node id="8568" />'<Node id="8569" />

<Node id="8571" />'<Node id="8572" />You try me very hard,' the Prince uttered.<Node id="8614" /> '<Node id="8616" />But I know the Stone will
destroy you at last.<Node id="8662" />'<Node id="8663" />

<Node id="8665" />'<Node id="8666" />Quite, quite,' Sir Giles said, standing up.<Node id="8709" /> '<Node id="8711" />Well, thank you for
coming.<Node id="8738" /> <Node id="8739" />If I could have pleased you, of course....<Node id="8781" /> <Node id="8782" />But I want to know
all about it first.<Node id="8820" />'<Node id="8821" />

<Node id="8823" />The Prince looked at the letters in the Stone.<Node id="8869" /> '<Node id="8871" />I think you will know a
great deal then,' he said, salaamed deeply to it, and without bowing to
the men turned and left the house.<Node id="9001" />

<Node id="9003" />Sir Giles went after him to the front door, though they exchanged no
more words, and, having watched him drive away returned to find his
nephew making hasty notes.<Node id="9166" />

<Node id="9168" />'<Node id="9169" />I don't see why we need a company,' he said.<Node id="9213" /> '<Node id="9215" />Just you and I, eh?<Node id="9234" />'<Node id="9235" />

<Node id="9237" />'<Node id="9238" />Why you?<Node id="9246" />' <Node id="9248" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="9264" /> '<Node id="9266" />What makes you think you're going to have
anything to do with it?<Node id="9331" />'<Node id="9332" />

<Node id="9334" />'<Node id="9335" />Why, you told me,' Montague exclaimed.<Node id="9373" /> '<Node id="9375" />You offered me a hand in the
game if I'd be about to-night when the Prince came in case he turned
nasty.<Node id="9479" />'<Node id="9480" />

<Node id="9482" />'<Node id="9483" />So I did,' his uncle answered.<Node id="9513" /> '<Node id="9515" />Yes--well, on conditions.<Node id="9540" /> <Node id="9541" />If there is
any money in it, I shall want some of it.<Node id="9594" /> <Node id="9595" />Not as much as you do, but
some.<Node id="9627" /> <Node id="9628" />It's always useful, and I had to pay pretty high to get the Stone.<Node id="9694" />
<Node id="9695" />And I don't want a fuss made about it--not yet.<Node id="9742" />'<Node id="9743" />

<Node id="9745" />'<Node id="9746" />That's all right,' Montague said.<Node id="9779" /> '<Node id="9781" />I was thinking it might be just as
well to have Uncle Christopher in with us.<Node id="9858" />'<Node id="9859" />

<Node id="9861" />'<Node id="9862" />Whatever for?<Node id="9875" />' <Node id="9877" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="9893" />

<Node id="9895" />'<Node id="9896" />Well ...<Node id="9904" /> <Node id="9905" />if there's any legal trouble, you know,' Montague said
vaguely.<Node id="9968" /> '<Node id="9970" />I mean--if it came to the Courts we might be glad--of course,
I don't know if they could--but anyhow he'd probably notice it if I
began to live on a million--and some of these swine will do anything if
their pockets are touched--all sorts of tricks they have--but a Chief
Justice _is_ a Chief Justice--that is, if you didn't mind----'<Node id="10304" />

<Node id="10306" />'<Node id="10307" />I don't mind,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="10337" /> '<Node id="10339" />Arglay's got a flat-footed kind of
intellect; that's why he's Chief Justice, I expect.<Node id="10425" /> <Node id="10426" />But for what it's
worth, and if they did try any international law business.<Node id="10502" /> <Node id="10503" />But they
can't; there was nothing to prevent that fellow selling it to me if
he chose, nor me buying.<Node id="10604" /> <Node id="10605" />I'll get Palliser here as soon as I can.<Node id="10645" />'<Node id="10646" />

<Node id="10648" />'<Node id="10649" />I wonder how many we ought to make,' Montague said.<Node id="10700" /> '<Node id="10702" />Shall we say
a dozen to start with?<Node id="10737" /> <Node id="10738" />It can't cost much to make a dozen bits of
gold--need it be gold?<Node id="10803" /> <Node id="10804" />Better, better.<Node id="10819" /> <Node id="10820" />Better keep it in the same
stuff--and it looks more for the money.<Node id="10886" /> <Node id="10887" />The money--why, we can ask
a million for each--for what'll only cost a guinea or two....<Node id="10975" />' <Node id="10977" />He
stopped, appalled by the stupendous vision, then he went on anxiously,
'The Prince did say a bit any size would do, didn't he?<Node id="11106" /> <Node id="11107" />and that this
fellow'--he pointed a finger at the Stone--'would keep the same size?<Node id="11190" /> <Node id="11191" />It
means a patent, of course; so if anybody else ever did get hold of the
original they couldn't use it.<Node id="11295" /> <Node id="11296" />Millions ...<Node id="11308" /> <Node id="11309" />millions....<Node id="11321" />'<Node id="11322" />

<Node id="11324" />'<Node id="11325" />Blast your filthy gasbag of a mouth!<Node id="11361" />' <Node id="11363" />Sir Giles said.<Node id="11378" /> '<Node id="11380" />You've made me
forget to ask one thing.<Node id="11419" /> <Node id="11420" />Does it work in time as well as space?<Node id="11458" /> <Node id="11459" />We must
try, we must try.<Node id="11484" />' <Node id="11486" />He sat down, picked up the Crown, and sat frowning at
the Divine Letters.<Node id="11559" />

<Node id="11561" />'<Node id="11562" />I don't see what you mean,' Reginald said, arrested in his note-taking.<Node id="11633" />
'<Node id="11635" />Time?<Node id="11640" /> <Node id="11641" />Go back, do you mean?<Node id="11662" />' <Node id="11664" />He considered, then, 'I shouldn't think
anyone would want to go back,' he said.<Node id="11743" />

<Node id="11745" />'<Node id="11746" />Forward then,' Sir Giles answered.<Node id="11780" /> '<Node id="11782" />Wouldn't you like to go forward to
the time when you've got your millions?<Node id="11856" />'<Node id="11857" />

<Node id="11859" />Reginald gaped at him.<Node id="11881" /> '<Node id="11883" />But ...<Node id="11890" /> <Node id="11891" />I shouldn't have them,' he began slowly,
'unless ...<Node id="11943" /> <Node id="11944" />eh?<Node id="11947" /> <Node id="11948" />O if I'm going to ...<Node id="11969" /> <Node id="11970" />then I should be able to jump to
when ...<Node id="12011" /> <Node id="12012" />but ...<Node id="12019" /> <Node id="12020" />I don't see how I could get at them unless I knew what
account they were in.<Node id="12096" /> <Node id="12097" />I shouldn't be that me, should I ...<Node id="12133" /> <Node id="12134" />or should I?<Node id="12146" />'<Node id="12147" />

<Node id="12149" />As his brain gave way, Sir Giles grinned.<Node id="12190" /> '<Node id="12192" />No,' he said almost
cheerfully, 'you'd have the money but with your present mind.<Node id="12273" /> <Node id="12274" />At least I
suppose so.<Node id="12296" /> <Node id="12297" />We don't know how it affects consciousness.<Node id="12340" /> <Node id="12341" />It might be an
easy way to suicide--ten minutes after death.<Node id="12401" />'<Node id="12402" />

<Node id="12404" />Reginald looked apprehensively at the Crown.<Node id="12448" /> '<Node id="12450" />I suppose it wouldn't go
wrong?<Node id="12481" />' <Node id="12483" />he ventured.<Node id="12495" />

<Node id="12497" />'<Node id="12498" />That we don't know,' Sir Giles answered cheerfully.<Node id="12549" /> '<Node id="12551" />I daresay your
first millionaire will hit the wrong spot, and be trampled underfoot by
wild elephants in Africa.<Node id="12663" /> <Node id="12664" />However, no one will know for a good while.<Node id="12707" />'<Node id="12708" />

<Node id="12710" />Reginald went back to his notes.<Node id="12742" />

<Node id="12744" />Meanwhile the Prince Ali drove through the London streets till he
reached the Embassy, steering the car almost mechanically while he
surveyed in his mind the position in which he found himself.<Node id="12937" /> <Node id="12938" />He foresaw
some difficulty in persuading his chief, who concealed under a sedate
rationalism an almost intense scepticism, of the disastrous chance
which, it appeared to the Prince, had befallen the august Relic.<Node id="13150" /> <Node id="13151" />Yet
not to attempt to enlist on the side of the Faith such prestige and
power as lay in the Embassy would be to abandon it to the ungodly uses
of Western financiers.<Node id="13316" /> <Node id="13317" />Ali himself had been trained through his
childhood in the Koran and the traditions, and, though the shifting
policies of Persia had flung him for awhile into the army and afterwards
into the diplomatic service his mind moved with most ease in the
romantic regions of myth.<Node id="13589" /> <Node id="13590" />Suleiman ben Daood, he knew, was a historic
figure--the ruler of a small nation which, in the momentary decrease
of its two neighbours, Egypt and Assyria, had attained an unstable
pre-eminence.<Node id="13783" /> <Node id="13784" />But Suleiman was also one of the four great world-shakers
before the Prophet, a commander of the Faithful, peculiarly favoured
by Allah.<Node id="13920" /> <Node id="13921" />He had been a Jew, but the Jews in those days were the only
witnesses to the Unity.<Node id="14004" /> '<Node id="14006" />There is no God but God,' he murmured to
himself, and cast a hostile glance at a crucifix which stood as a war
memorial in the grounds of a church near the Embassy.<Node id="14170" /> '"<Node id="14173" />Say: for those
who believe not is the torment of hell: an evil journey shall it be.<Node id="14256" />"'
<Node id="14259" />With which quotation he delivered the car to a servant and went in to
find the Ambassador, whom he discovered half-asleep over the latest
volume of Memoirs.<Node id="14415" /> <Node id="14416" />He bowed and waited in silence.<Node id="14447" />

<Node id="14449" />'<Node id="14450" />My dear Ali,' the Ambassador said, rousing himself.<Node id="14501" /> '<Node id="14503" />Did you have a
good evening?<Node id="14531" />'<Node id="14532" />

<Node id="14534" />'<Node id="14535" />No,' the young man answered coldly.<Node id="14570" />

<Node id="14572" />'<Node id="14573" />I didn't expect you would,' his chief said.<Node id="14616" /> '<Node id="14618" />You orthodox young
water-drinkers can hardly expect to enjoy a dinner.<Node id="14688" /> <Node id="14689" />Was it, so to speak,
a dinner?<Node id="14719" />'<Node id="14720" />

<Node id="14722" />'<Node id="14723" />I was concerned, sir,' the Prince said, 'with the Crown of Suleiman, on
whom be the Peace.<Node id="14813" />'<Node id="14814" />

<Node id="14816" />'<Node id="14817" />Really,' the Ambassador asked.<Node id="14847" /> '<Node id="14849" />You really saw it?<Node id="14867" /> <Node id="14868" />And is it
authentic?<Node id="14888" />'<Node id="14889" />

<Node id="14891" />'<Node id="14892" />It is without doubt the Crown and the Stone,' Ali answered.<Node id="14951" /> <Node id="14952" />The
Ambassador stared, but Ali went on.<Node id="14991" /> '<Node id="14993" />And it is in the hands of the
infidel.<Node id="15031" /> <Node id="15032" />I have seen one of these dogs----'<Node id="15066" />

<Node id="15068" />His chief frowned a little.<Node id="15095" /> '<Node id="15097" />I have asked you,' he said, '--even when
we are alone--to speak of these people without such phrases.<Node id="15198" />'<Node id="15199" />

<Node id="15201" />'<Node id="15202" />I beg your Excellency's pardon,' the Prince said.<Node id="15251" /> '<Node id="15253" />I have seen one of
them use it--by the Permission--and return unharmed.<Node id="15324" /> <Node id="15325" />It is undoubtedly
the Crown.<Node id="15353" />'<Node id="15354" />

<Node id="15356" />'<Node id="15357" />The crown of a Jew?<Node id="15376" />' <Node id="15378" />the Ambassador murmured.<Node id="15402" /> '<Node id="15404" />My friend, I do not say
I disbelieve you, but--have you told your uncle?<Node id="15476" />'<Node id="15477" />

<Node id="15479" />'<Node id="15480" />I reported first to you, sir,' the Prince answered.<Node id="15531" /> '<Node id="15533" />If you wish my
uncle----' He paused.<Node id="15569" />

<Node id="15571" />'<Node id="15572" />O by all means, by all means,' the Ambassador said, getting up.<Node id="15635" /> '<Node id="15637" />Ask
him to come here.<Node id="15658" />' <Node id="15660" />He stood stroking his beard while a servant was
dispatched on the errand, and until a very old man, with white hair,
bent and wrinkled, came into the room.<Node id="15815" />

<Node id="15817" />'<Node id="15818" />The Peace be upon you, Hajji Ibrahim,' he said in Persian, while the
Prince kissed his uncle's hand.<Node id="15918" /> '<Node id="15920" />Do me the honour to be seated.<Node id="15950" /> <Node id="15951" />I desire
you to know that your nephew is convinced of the authenticity of that
which Sir Giles Tumulty holds.<Node id="16060" />' <Node id="16062" />He eyed the old man for a moment.<Node id="16095" /> '<Node id="16097" />But
I do not clearly know,' he ended, 'what you now wish me to do.<Node id="16163" />'<Node id="16164" />

<Node id="16166" />Hajji Ibrahim looked at his nephew.<Node id="16201" /> '<Node id="16203" />And what will this Sir Giles
Tumulty do with the sacred Crown?<Node id="16265" />' <Node id="16267" />he asked.<Node id="16276" />

<Node id="16278" />'<Node id="16279" />He himself,' the Prince said carefully, 'will examine it and experiment
with it, may the dogs of the street devour him!<Node id="16398" /> <Node id="16399" />But there was also
present a young man, his relation, who desires to make other crowns from
it and sell them for money.<Node id="16518" /> <Node id="16519" />For he sees that by the least of the graces
of the divine Stone those who wear it may pass at once from place to
place, and there are many who would buy such power at a great price.<Node id="16700" />'
<Node id="16702" />The formal phrases with which he controlled his rage broke suddenly and
he closed in colloquial excitement, 'He will form a company and put it
on the market.<Node id="16859" />'<Node id="16860" />

<Node id="16862" />The old man nodded.<Node id="16881" /> '<Node id="16883" />And even though Iblis destroy him----' he began.<Node id="16931" />

<Node id="16933" />'<Node id="16934" />I implore you, my uncle,' the young Prince broke in, 'to urge upon his
Excellency the horrible sacrilege involved.<Node id="17048" /> <Node id="17049" />It is a very dreadful thing
for us that by the fault of our house this thing should come into the
possession of the infidels.<Node id="17174" /> <Node id="17175" />It is not to be borne that they should put
it to these uses; it is against the interests of our country and the
sanctity of our Faith.<Node id="17309" />'<Node id="17310" />

<Node id="17312" />The Ambassador, his head on one side, was staring at his shoes.<Node id="17375" /> '<Node id="17377" />It
might perhaps be held that the Christians derive as much from Judah as
we,' he said.<Node id="17464" />

<Node id="17466" />'<Node id="17467" />It will not so be held in Tehran and in Delhi and in Cairo and in
Beyrout and in Mecca,' the Prince answered.<Node id="17576" /> '<Node id="17578" />I will raise the East
against them before this thing shall be done.<Node id="17645" />'<Node id="17646" />

<Node id="17648" />'<Node id="17649" />I direct your attention,' the Ambassador said stiffly,' to the fact
that it is for me only to talk of what shall or shall not be done,
under the sanction of Reza Shah who governs Persia to-day.<Node id="17842" />'<Node id="17843" />

<Node id="17845" />'<Node id="17846" />Sir,' the Prince said, 'in this case it is a crown greater than the
diadem of Reza Shah that is at stake.<Node id="17951" />'<Node id="17952" />

<Node id="17954" />'<Node id="17955" />With submission,' the old man broke in, 'will not your Excellency make
representations to the English Government?<Node id="18068" /> <Node id="18069" />This is not a matter which
any Government can consider without alarm.<Node id="18138" />'<Node id="18139" />

<Node id="18141" />'<Node id="18142" />That is no doubt so,' the Ambassador allowed.<Node id="18187" /> '<Node id="18189" />But, Hajji Ibrahim, if
I go to the English Government and say that one of their nationals, by
bribing a member of your house, has come into the possession of a very
sacred relic they will not be in the mind to take it from him; and if I
add that this gives men power to jump about like grasshoppers they will
ask me for proof.<Node id="18515" />' <Node id="18517" />He paused.<Node id="18527" /> '<Node id="18529" />And if you could give them proof, or if
this Sir Giles would let them have it, do you think they would restore
it to us?<Node id="18649" />'<Node id="18650" />

<Node id="18652" />'<Node id="18653" />Will you at least try, sir?<Node id="18680" />' <Node id="18682" />Ali asked.<Node id="18692" />

<Node id="18694" />'<Node id="18695" />Why, no,' the Ambassador answered.<Node id="18729" /> '<Node id="18731" />No, I do not think I will even
try.<Node id="18766" /> <Node id="18767" />It is but the word of Hajji Ibrahim here.<Node id="18808" /> <Node id="18809" />Had he not known of the
treachery of his kinsmen and come to England by the same boat as Giles
Tumulty we should have known very little of what had happened, and that
vaguely.<Node id="18984" /> <Node id="18985" />But as it is, we were warned of what you call the sacrilege,
and now you have talked to him, and you are convinced.<Node id="19100" /> <Node id="19101" />But what shall
I say to the Foreign Minister?<Node id="19146" /> <Node id="19147" />No; I do not think I will try.<Node id="19177" />'<Node id="19178" />

<Node id="19180" />'<Node id="19181" />You do not believe it,' the Hajji said.<Node id="19220" /> '<Node id="19222" />You do not believe that this
is the Crown of Suleiman or that Allah put a mystery into it when His
Permission bestowed it on the King?<Node id="19356" />'<Node id="19357" />

<Node id="19359" />The Ambassador considered.<Node id="19385" /> '<Node id="19387" />I have known you a long while,' he said
thoughtfully, 'and I will tell you what I believe.<Node id="19477" /> <Node id="19478" />I know that your
family, which has always been known for a very holy house, has held for
centuries certain relics, and has preserved them in great secrecy and
remoteness.<Node id="19648" /> <Node id="19649" />I know that among them tradition has said that there is the
Crown of the King, and that, but a few weeks since, one of the keepers
was bribed to part with this Crown--if such it be--to an Englishman.<Node id="19848" /> <Node id="19849" />I
believe that many curious powers exist in such things, lasting for a
longer or shorter time.<Node id="19943" /> <Node id="19944" />And--because I believe Ali--I believe that it
has seemed to him that a man has been here and there in a moment.<Node id="20055" /> <Node id="20056" />But
how, or whether indeed, this has been I do not know, and I do not desire
to argue upon it with the English ministers.<Node id="20177" />' <Node id="20179" />He shook his head.<Node id="20197" /> '<Node id="20199" />I
risked too much even when I permitted you semi-officially to try and buy
it back from Sir Giles.<Node id="20297" />'<Node id="20298" />

<Node id="20300" />'<Node id="20301" />But he would not sell it,' the Prince cried.<Node id="20345" />

<Node id="20347" />'<Node id="20348" />A very natural feeling,' the Ambassador said, and added rather
incautiously, 'If I had it myself I don't suppose I should sell it.<Node id="20478" />'<Node id="20479" />

<Node id="20481" />'<Node id="20482" />Then,' the Prince insisted, 'if your Excellency will do nothing, it is
for me to act.<Node id="20567" /> <Node id="20568" />There is a sin upon my house till I recover the Crown.<Node id="20622" />'<Node id="20623" />

<Node id="20625" />'<Node id="20626" />And what will you do, my friend?<Node id="20658" />' <Node id="20660" />the Ambassador asked.<Node id="20681" />

<Node id="20683" />'<Node id="20684" />I shall cause all my relatives and my acquaintances in Persia to know
of it, and I will take such an oath that they will certainly believe,'
the Prince answered.<Node id="20845" /> '<Node id="20847" />I will send the news of it through all the palaces
and bazaars.<Node id="20910" /> <Node id="20911" />I will cause this sacrilege to be known in every mosque,
and the cry against the English shall go from Adrianople to Hong Kong.<Node id="21038" />
<Node id="21039" />I will see if I can do a little in all the places of Islam.<Node id="21098" />'<Node id="21099" />

<Node id="21101" />'<Node id="21102" />You will make the English Government curious, I believe,' the
Ambassador said, 'and you may kill a few soldiers.<Node id="21214" /> <Node id="21215" />But I do not think
you will recover the Crown.<Node id="21261" /> <Node id="21262" />Also you will do these things against my
will.<Node id="21308" />'<Node id="21309" />

<Node id="21311" />Hajji Ibrahim said suddenly, 'By the Permission it was taken; by the
Permission it will return.<Node id="21406" /> <Node id="21407" />When the Unity deigned to bestow the Stone
upon the King it was not that he might go swiftly from place to place.<Node id="21520" />
<Node id="21521" />I think it shall return to the Keepers only when one shall use it for
the journey that is without space, and I do not think that shall be you,
my nephew, nor any of us.<Node id="21689" /> <Node id="21690" />Let spies be set upon the infidels and let us
know what they do.<Node id="21754" /> <Node id="21755" />But do not let us wake the bazaars.<Node id="21790" /> <Node id="21791" />I do not think
that will help you at all.<Node id="21832" />'<Node id="21833" />

<Node id="21835" />'<Node id="21836" />And the English Government?<Node id="21863" />' <Node id="21865" />the Ambassador asked.<Node id="21886" />

<Node id="21888" />'<Node id="21889" />A soft word in the ear of a friend,' the Hajji said.<Node id="21941" /> '<Node id="21943" />Be very friendly
with them--and that your Excellency may well do, for you are almost as
one of them.<Node id="22043" /> <Node id="22044" />But speak only of a relic and not of the virtues of the
relic; seek peace and ensue it, as their scriptures say.<Node id="22156" /> <Node id="22157" />The English
will not have war for the sake of Giles Tumulty, unless their pride is
touched.<Node id="22248" />' <Node id="22250" />He rose to his feet.<Node id="22270" /> '<Node id="22272" />The Peace be upon you,' he said and went
to the door.<Node id="22325" />




<Node id="22330" />CHAPTER II<Node id="22340" />

<Node id="22342" />THE PUPIL OF ORGANIC LAW<Node id="22366" />


<Node id="22369" />'<Node id="22370" />You ought to know by now,' Lord Arglay said into the telephone, 'that I
can't possibly put any money into your companies....<Node id="22494" /> <Node id="22495" />C�sar's wife....<Node id="22511" />
<Node id="22512" />No, I am....<Node id="22524" /> <Node id="22525" />O never mind....<Node id="22541" /> <Node id="22542" />Yes....<Node id="22549" /> <Node id="22550" />Certainly....<Node id="22563" /> <Node id="22564" />As much as you
like....<Node id="22587" /> <Node id="22588" />Lunch then.<Node id="22599" />' <Node id="22601" />He put the receiver back.<Node id="22626" /> '<Node id="22628" />It's an extraordinary
thing,' he went on to Chloe Burnett, as she lifted her hands again to
the typewriter, 'that Reginald won't realize how careful I have to be of
what my money is in.<Node id="22813" /> <Node id="22814" />It's a wonder I have any private income at all.<Node id="22861" /> <Node id="22862" />As
it is, whenever I give a decision in a financial case I expect to be
left comparatively penniless in a month or two.<Node id="22981" />'<Node id="22982" />

<Node id="22984" />'<Node id="22985" />Does Mr. Montague want you to invest?<Node id="23022" />' <Node id="23024" />Miss Burnett asked.<Node id="23043" />

<Node id="23045" />'<Node id="23046" />He wants me to give him five hundred, so far as I can understand,' Lord
Arglay said, 'to put in the best thing that ever was.<Node id="23171" /> <Node id="23172" />What is the best
thing that ever was?<Node id="23209" />'<Node id="23210" />

<Node id="23212" />Miss Burnett looked at her typewriter and offered no opinion.<Node id="23273" />

<Node id="23275" />'<Node id="23276" />I suppose that I ought to think the Twelve Tables were,' the Chief
Justice went on, 'officially--or the Code Napol�on--but they're rather
specialist.<Node id="23425" /> <Node id="23426" />And anyhow when you say "that ever was," do you mean that
it's stopped being?<Node id="23503" /> <Node id="23504" />Or can it still be?<Node id="23523" />... <Node id="23527" />Miss Burnett,' he added
after a pause, 'I was asking you a question.<Node id="23595" />'<Node id="23596" />

<Node id="23598" />'<Node id="23599" />I don't know, Lord Arglay,' Chloe said patiently.<Node id="23648" /> '<Node id="23650" />I never can answer
that sort of question.<Node id="23691" /> <Node id="23692" />I suppose it depends on what you mean by "was.<Node id="23738" />"
<Node id="23740" />But oughtn't we to get on with the rest of the chapter before lunch?<Node id="23808" />'<Node id="23809" />

<Node id="23811" />Lord Arglay sighed and looked at his notes.<Node id="23854" /> '<Node id="23856" />I suppose so, but I'd much
rather talk.<Node id="23895" /> _<Node id="23897" />Was_ there ever a best thing that ever was?<Node id="23940" /> <Node id="23941" />Never mind;
you're right as usual.<Node id="23975" /> <Node id="23976" />Where were we?<Node id="23990" /> <Node id="23991" />The judgement of Lord
Mansfield----' He began dictating.<Node id="24047" />

<Node id="24049" />There was, in fact, time for an hour's work before Mr. Montague arrived
for lunch.<Node id="24131" /> <Node id="24132" />Chloe Burnett had been engaged six months before by Lord
Arglay as general intellectual factotum when he had determined to begin
work on his _Survey of Organic Law_.<Node id="24297" /> <Node id="24298" />When the Chief Justice was at the
Courts she spent her time reducing to typed order whatever material Lord
Arglay left ready for her the night before.<Node id="24448" /> <Node id="24449" />But during the vacation,
since he had remained in town, it had become a habit for them to lunch
together, and neither Chloe's intention of withdrawing or Mr. Montague's
obvious uneasiness caused Lord Arglay to break it.<Node id="24668" />

<Node id="24670" />'<Node id="24671" />Of course you'll lunch here,' he said to Chloe, and to Mr. Montague's
private explanations that the matter in hand was very secret, 'That's
all right; two can spoil a secret but three make a conspiracy, which is
much safer.<Node id="24894" />'<Node id="24895" />

<Node id="24897" />'<Node id="24898" />And now,' he said to his nephew after they were settled, 'what is it?<Node id="24967" />
<Node id="24968" />What do you want me to put my money in this time?<Node id="25017" /> <Node id="25018" />I shan't, of course,
but what's it all about?<Node id="25063" />'<Node id="25064" />

<Node id="25066" />'<Node id="25067" />Well, it's a kind of _transport_,' Reginald said.<Node id="25116" /> '<Node id="25118" />It came to me
through Uncle Giles, who wanted me to help him in an experiment.<Node id="25196" />'<Node id="25197" />

<Node id="25199" />'<Node id="25200" />Was it a dangerous experiment?<Node id="25230" />' <Node id="25232" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="25250" />

<Node id="25252" />'<Node id="25253" />O I don't think _dangerous_,' Montague answered.<Node id="25301" /> '<Node id="25303" />Unusual perhaps, but
not dangerous.<Node id="25338" /> <Node id="25339" />When he came back from Baghdad this time he brought with
him a funny kind of a thing, something ...<Node id="25438" /> <Node id="25439" />well, something like a crown
and something ...<Node id="25485" /> <Node id="25486" />something...<Node id="25498" />'<Node id="25499" />

<Node id="25501" />'<Node id="25502" />Something not,' said Lord Arglay.<Node id="25535" /> '<Node id="25537" />Quite.<Node id="25543" /> <Node id="25544" />Well?<Node id="25549" />'<Node id="25550" />

<Node id="25552" />'<Node id="25553" />Made of gold,' Reginald went on, 'with a stone--_that_ size ...<Node id="25616" /> <Node id="25617" />in the
middle.<Node id="25631" /> <Node id="25632" />Well, so he asked me over to help him experiment, and there was
a man from the Persian Embassy there too, who said it was what Sir Giles
thought it was--at least, he'd bought it as being--but that doesn't
matter.<Node id="25844" /> <Node id="25845" />Well now, this thing--I know you won't believe it--it sounds
so silly; only you know I did it.<Node id="25939" /> <Node id="25940" />Not Sir Giles--he said he wanted to
observe, but I did.<Node id="25995" /> <Node id="25996" />The Persian fellow was rather upset about it, at
least not upset, but a bit high in the air, you know.<Node id="26098" /> <Node id="26099" />Rather frosty.<Node id="26113" /> <Node id="26114" />But
I'm bound to say he met us quite fairly, said he was perfectly willing
to admit that we had it, and to make it clear to us what it was; only he
must have it back.<Node id="26280" /> <Node id="26281" />But that would have been too silly.<Node id="26316" />'<Node id="26317" />

<Node id="26319" />As Mr. Montague paused for a moment Lord Arglay looked at Chloe.<Node id="26383" />
'<Node id="26385" />It's a fact I've continually observed in the witness box,' he said
abstractedly, 'that nine people out of ten, off their own subject, are
incapable of lucidity, whereas on their own subject they can be as
direct as a straight line before Einstein.<Node id="26632" /> <Node id="26633" />I had a fellow once who
couldn't put three words together sanely; we were all hopeless, till
counsel got him on his own business--which happened to be statistics of
the development of industry in the Central American Republics; and then
for about five minutes I understood exactly what had been happening
there for the last seventy years.<Node id="26971" /> <Node id="26972" />Curious.<Node id="26980" /> <Node id="26981" />You and I are either silent
or lucid.<Node id="27018" /> <Node id="27019" />Yes, Reginald?<Node id="27033" /> <Node id="27034" />Never mind me, I've often been meaning to tell
Miss Burnett that, and it just came into my mind.<Node id="27130" /> <Node id="27131" />Yes?<Node id="27135" />'<Node id="27136" />

<Node id="27138" />'<Node id="27139" />O he was lucid enough,' Reginald said.<Node id="27177" /> '<Node id="27179" />Well it seems this thing was
supposed to be the crown of King Suleiman, but of course as to that I
can't say.<Node id="27288" /> <Node id="27289" />But I can tell you this.<Node id="27313" />' <Node id="27315" />He pointed a fork at the Chief
Justice.<Node id="27354" /> '<Node id="27356" />I put that thing on my head--' Chloe gave a small gasp--'and
I willed myself to be back in my rooms in Rowland Street, and there I
was.<Node id="27491" />' <Node id="27493" />He stopped.<Node id="27504" /> <Node id="27505" />Lord Arglay and Chloe were both staring at him.<Node id="27552" /> '<Node id="27554" />There
I was,' he repeated.<Node id="27580" /> '<Node id="27582" />And then I willed myself back at Ealing, and
_there_ I was.<Node id="27641" />'<Node id="27642" />

<Node id="27644" />Chloe went on staring.<Node id="27666" /> <Node id="27667" />Lord Arglay frowned a little.<Node id="27696" /> '<Node id="27698" />What do you mean?<Node id="27715" />'
<Node id="27717" />he said, with a sound of the Chief Justice in his voice.<Node id="27773" />

<Node id="27775" />'<Node id="27776" />I mean that I just was,' Reginald said victoriously.<Node id="27828" /> '<Node id="27830" />I don't know how
I got there.<Node id="27859" /> <Node id="27860" />I felt a little dizzy at the time, and I had a headache
of sorts afterwards.<Node id="27936" /> <Node id="27937" />But without any kind of doubt I was one minute in
Ealing and the next in Rowland Street, one minute in Rowland Street and
the next in Ealing.<Node id="28078" />'<Node id="28079" />

<Node id="28081" />The two listeners looked at each other, and were silent for two or three
minutes.<Node id="28162" /> <Node id="28163" />Reginald leaned back and waited for more.<Node id="28204" />

<Node id="28206" />Lord Arglay said at last, 'I won't ask you if you were drunk, Reginald,
because I don't think you'd tell me this extraordinary story if you
were drunk then unless you were drunk now, which you seem not to be.<Node id="28414" /> <Node id="28415" />I
wonder what exactly it was that Giles did.<Node id="28459" /> <Node id="28460" />Sir Giles Tumulty, Miss
Burnett, is one of the most cantankerously crooked birds I have ever
known.<Node id="28559" /> <Node id="28560" />He is, unfortunately, my remote brother-in-law; his brother was
Reginald's mother's second husband--you know the kind of riddle-me-ree
relationship.<Node id="28708" /> <Node id="28709" />He's obscurely connected with diabolism in two continents;
he has written a classic work on the ritual of Priapus; he is the first
authority in the world on certain subjects, and the first authority in
hell on one or two more.<Node id="28935" /> <Node id="28936" />Yet he never seems to do anything himself;
he's always in the background as an interested observer.<Node id="29035" /> <Node id="29036" />I wonder what
exactly it was that he did and still more I wonder why he did it.<Node id="29115" />'<Node id="29116" />

<Node id="29118" />'<Node id="29119" />But he didn't do anything,' Reginald said indignantly.<Node id="29173" /> '<Node id="29175" />He just sat and
watched.<Node id="29199" />'<Node id="29200" />

<Node id="29202" />'<Node id="29203" />Of two explanations,' Lord Arglay said, 'other things being equal, one
should prefer that most consonant with normal human experience.<Node id="29337" /> <Node id="29338" />That
Giles should play some sort of trick on you is consonant with human
experience; that you should fly through the air in ten minutes is
not--at least it doesn't seem so to me.<Node id="29516" /> <Node id="29517" />What do you think, Miss
Burnett?<Node id="29549" />'<Node id="29550" />

<Node id="29552" />'<Node id="29553" />I don't seem to believe it somehow,' Chloe said.<Node id="29601" /> '<Node id="29603" />Did you say it was
the Crown of Suleiman, Mr. Montague?<Node id="29658" /> <Node id="29659" />I thought he went on a carpet.<Node id="29689" />'<Node id="29690" />

<Node id="29692" />Lord Arglay stopped a cigarette halfway to his lips.<Node id="29744" /> '<Node id="29746" />Eh?<Node id="29749" />' <Node id="29751" />he said.<Node id="29759" />
'<Node id="29761" />What a treasure you are as a secretary, Miss Burnett!<Node id="29814" /> <Node id="29815" />So he did, I
seem to remember.<Node id="29845" /> <Node id="29846" />You're sure it wasn't a carpet, Reginald?<Node id="29887" />'<Node id="29888" />

<Node id="29890" />'<Node id="29891" />Of course I'm sure,' Reginald said irritably.<Node id="29936" /> '<Node id="29938" />Should I mistake a
carpet for a crown?<Node id="29976" /> <Node id="29977" />And I never knew that Suleiman had either
particularly.<Node id="30032" />'<Node id="30033" />

<Node id="30035" />Lord Arglay, pursuing his own thoughts, shook his head.<Node id="30090" /> '<Node id="30092" />It would be
like Giles to have the details right, you know,' he said.<Node id="30161" /> '<Node id="30163" />If there was
a king who travelled so, that would be the king Giles would bring out
for whatever his wishes might be.<Node id="30279" /> <Node id="30280" />Look here, Reginald, what did he want
you to do?<Node id="30328" />'<Node id="30329" />

<Node id="30331" />'<Node id="30332" />Nothing,' Reginald answered.<Node id="30360" /> '<Node id="30362" />But the point is this.<Node id="30384" />' <Node id="30386" />Confirming the
Chief Justice's previous dictum he became suddenly lucid.<Node id="30458" /> '<Node id="30460" />The Persian
man told us that small fractions taken from the Stone--it's the Stone in
the Crown that does it--have the same power.<Node id="30589" /> <Node id="30590" />Now, if that's so, we can
have circlets made--with a chip in each, and just think what any man
with money would give to have a thing like that.<Node id="30733" /> <Node id="30734" />Think of a fellow in
Throgmorton Street being able to be in Wall Street in two seconds!<Node id="30821" /> <Node id="30822" />Think
of Foreign Secretaries!<Node id="30851" /> <Node id="30852" />Think of the Secret Service!<Node id="30880" /> <Node id="30881" />Think of war!<Node id="30894" />
<Node id="30895" />Every Government will need them.<Node id="30927" /> _<Node id="30929" />And we have the monopoly.<Node id="30954" />_ <Node id="30956" />It means
a colossal fortune--colossal.<Node id="30994" /> <Node id="30995" />O uncle, you _must_ come in.<Node id="31023" /> <Node id="31024" />I want a
thousand: I can get six hundred or so quietly--not a word must leak out
or I could do more, of course.<Node id="31135" /> <Node id="31136" />Give me five hundred and I'll get you
fifty thousand times five hundred back.<Node id="31213" />'<Node id="31214" />

<Node id="31216" />Lord Arglay disregarded this appeal.<Node id="31252" /> '<Node id="31254" />Did you say the other man belonged
to the Persian Embassy?<Node id="31312" />' <Node id="31314" />he asked.<Node id="31323" /> '<Node id="31325" />What did he want anyway?<Node id="31349" />'<Node id="31350" />

<Node id="31352" />'<Node id="31353" />He wanted it back,' Reginald said.<Node id="31387" /> '<Node id="31389" />Some sort of religious idea, I
fancy.<Node id="31426" /> <Node id="31427" />But really Sir Giles only needed him in order to make sure it was
authentic.<Node id="31503" />'<Node id="31504" />

<Node id="31506" />'<Node id="31507" />If Giles thought it _was_ authentic,' Lord Arglay said, 'I'd bet any
money he wanted to tantalize him with it.<Node id="31617" /> <Node id="31618" />If there was an _it_, which
of course I don't believe.<Node id="31672" />'<Node id="31673" />

<Node id="31675" />'<Node id="31676" />But I saw it, I touched it, I used it,' Reginald cried out lyrically.<Node id="31745" />
'<Node id="31747" />I tell you, I did it.<Node id="31768" />'<Node id="31769" />

<Node id="31771" />'<Node id="31772" />I know you do,' the Chief Justice answered.<Node id="31815" /> '<Node id="31817" />And though I shan't give
you the money I'm bound to say I feel extremely curious.<Node id="31898" />' <Node id="31900" />He got up
slowly.<Node id="31917" /> '<Node id="31919" />I think,' he said, 'the telephone.<Node id="31953" /> <Node id="31954" />Excuse me a few minutes.<Node id="31978" /> <Node id="31979" />I
want to try and catch Giles if he's in.<Node id="32020" />'<Node id="32021" />

<Node id="32023" />When he had gone out of the room a sudden consciousness of their
respective positions fell on the other two.<Node id="32131" /> <Node id="32132" />Reginald Montague became
acutely aware that he had been revealing an immense and incredible
secret to a girl in his uncle's employment.<Node id="32267" /> <Node id="32268" />Chloe became angrily
conscious that she could not interrogate this young man as she would
have done her own friends.<Node id="32384" /> <Node id="32385" />This annoyed her the more because, compared
with Lord Arglay's learning and amused observation, she knew him to be
trivial and greedy.<Node id="32519" /> <Node id="32520" />But she, though certain of a greater affection for
the Chief Justice than he had, was a servant and he a relation.<Node id="32634" /> <Node id="32635" />She
thought of the phrase again--'the Crown of Suleiman.<Node id="32691" />' <Node id="32693" />The crown of
Suleiman and Reginald Montague!<Node id="32737" />

<Node id="32739" />'<Node id="32740" />Sounds awfully funny, doesn't it, Miss Burnett?<Node id="32787" />' <Node id="32789" />Mr. Montague asked,
coming carefully down to her level.<Node id="32844" />

<Node id="32846" />'<Node id="32847" />Lord Arglay seemed to think Sir Giles was having a joke with you,' she
answered coldly.<Node id="32934" /> '<Node id="32936" />A kind of mesmerism, perhaps.<Node id="32965" />'<Node id="32966" />

<Node id="32968" />'<Node id="32969" />O that's just my uncle's way,' Reginald said sharply.<Node id="33022" /> '<Node id="33024" />He likes to pull
my leg a bit.<Node id="33054" />'<Node id="33055" />

<Node id="33057" />'<Node id="33058" />So Lord Arglay seemed to think,' Chloe said.<Node id="33102" />

<Node id="33104" />'<Node id="33105" />No, I mean Lord Arglay,' Reginald said more irritably than before.<Node id="33171" />

<Node id="33173" />'<Node id="33174" />You mean Lord Arglay really believes it all?<Node id="33218" />' <Node id="33220" />Chloe said, surprised.<Node id="33242" />
'<Node id="33244" />O do you think so, Mr. Montague?<Node id="33276" />'<Node id="33277" />

<Node id="33279" />'<Node id="33280" />Lord Arglay and I understand one another,' Reginald threw over
carelessly.<Node id="33354" />

<Node id="33356" />'<Node id="33357" />One another?<Node id="33369" />' <Node id="33371" />Chloe said.<Node id="33382" /> '<Node id="33384" />Both of you?<Node id="33396" /> <Node id="33397" />But how splendid!<Node id="33414" /> <Node id="33415" />He's such an
able man, isn't he?<Node id="33447" /> <Node id="33448" />It must be wonderful to understand him so well.<Node id="33495" />' <Node id="33497" />She
frowned thoughtfully.<Node id="33522" /> '<Node id="33524" />Of course I don't know what to think.<Node id="33561" />'<Node id="33562" />

<Node id="33564" />'<Node id="33565" />Ah well, that doesn't so much matter, does it?<Node id="33611" /> <Node id="33612" />I mean----' He
hesitated.<Node id="33637" />

<Node id="33639" />'<Node id="33640" />O I know it isn't my money that comes in,' Chloe hastened to say.<Node id="33705" /> '<Node id="33707" />I do
realize that, Mr. Montague.<Node id="33739" />'<Node id="33740" />

<Node id="33742" />'<Node id="33743" />It isn't a question of money--not first of all,' Reginald protested.<Node id="33811" />
'<Node id="33813" />It's a matter of general interest.<Node id="33847" />'<Node id="33848" />

<Node id="33850" />Chloe said nothing, chiefly because she was a little ashamed of herself,
but the result was almost worse than if she had made another effort.<Node id="33991" /> <Node id="33992" />The
commenting silence extended itself for some minutes and was broken at
last by Lord Arglay's return.<Node id="34095" />

<Node id="34097" />'<Node id="34098" />Well,' he said, 'I've been talking to Giles.<Node id="34142" /> <Node id="34143" />I'm bound to say he swears
it's quite right, and sticks to you in every particular, Reginald.<Node id="34236" />
<Node id="34237" />However, he's asked us to go over to-night and see.<Node id="34288" /> <Node id="34289" />Miss Burnett, can
you come?<Node id="34316" />'<Node id="34317" />

<Node id="34319" />'<Node id="34320" />O but, Lord Arglay, ought I to...<Node id="34353" />' <Node id="34355" />Chloe said doubtfully; and 'I don't
suppose Miss Burnett would find it very interesting,' Reginald hastily
threw in.<Node id="34471" />

<Node id="34473" />'<Node id="34474" />Civilized man,' Lord Arglay said, 'is known by the capacity of his
intellect to produce convincing reasons for his emotions.<Node id="34598" /> _<Node id="34600" />Convincing_,
Reginald.<Node id="34622" /> <Node id="34623" />Say anything you like, except to suggest that anyone wouldn't
be interested in this new interstellar traffic of yours.<Node id="34741" /> <Node id="34742" />Besides, I need
my secretary.<Node id="34771" /> <Node id="34772" />I shall be out this afternoon and I officially request
her to spend her time looking up all the references to Suleiman the son
of David that she can find.<Node id="34926" /> <Node id="34927" />We will all dine here at seven and then go
to Ealing.<Node id="34980" /> <Node id="34981" />That suit you, Miss Burnett?<Node id="35009" /> <Node id="35010" />You, Reginald?<Node id="35024" /> <Node id="35025" />Right.<Node id="35031" />'<Node id="35032" />

<Node id="35034" />Reginald got up to go.<Node id="35056" /> '<Node id="35058" />Well, you won't finally decide against coming
in until to-night, will you, uncle?<Node id="35139" />' <Node id="35141" />he said.<Node id="35149" /> '<Node id="35151" />Good-bye, Miss Burnett.<Node id="35174" />
<Node id="35175" />Don't let my uncle persuade you to come if you don't want to.<Node id="35236" />'<Node id="35237" />

<Node id="35239" />'<Node id="35240" />I won't,' Chloe said politely, 'as I shan't be able to have a financial
interest.<Node id="35321" /> <Node id="35322" />Good-bye, Mr. Montague.<Node id="35345" />'<Node id="35346" />

<Node id="35348" />When Reginald had gone--'And why the scratch, Miss Burnett?<Node id="35407" />' <Node id="35409" />Lord Arglay
asked.<Node id="35427" /> '<Node id="35429" />Quite right, of course, but why to-day especially?<Node id="35479" /> <Node id="35480" />Generally you
just let Reginald fleet by.<Node id="35521" /> <Node id="35522" />Why this unwonted sharpness?<Node id="35550" />'<Node id="35551" />

<Node id="35553" />'<Node id="35554" />I beg your pardon,' Chloe said.<Node id="35585" /> '<Node id="35587" />I don't quite know.<Node id="35606" /> <Node id="35607" />It was impertinent
of me.<Node id="35632" /> <Node id="35633" />I didn't mean to be rude to you.<Node id="35665" />'<Node id="35666" />

<Node id="35668" />'<Node id="35669" />Not in the least impertinent,' the Chief Justice answered.<Node id="35727" /> '<Node id="35729" />Quite
remarkably relevant.<Node id="35755" /> <Node id="35756" />But why to-day?<Node id="35771" />'<Node id="35772" />

<Node id="35774" />'<Node id="35775" />I think it was his talk of the Crown of Suleiman,' Chloe said
reluctantly.<Node id="35849" /> '<Node id="35851" />Somehow...<Node id="35861" />'<Node id="35862" />

<Node id="35864" />Arglay shook his head.<Node id="35886" /> '<Node id="35888" />I wouldn't pin much to that.<Node id="35916" /> <Node id="35917" />My belief is still
that Giles has been hocussing that young man.<Node id="35981" /> <Node id="35982" />But I'm curious to know
why; and anyhow it wouldn't do me any harm to know as much as you about
the son of David.<Node id="36095" /> <Node id="36096" />I can't think of another fact about him at present.<Node id="36147" /> <Node id="36148" />So
you dig out what you can and then clear off and be back by seven.<Node id="36216" />'<Node id="36217" />

<Node id="36219" />'<Node id="36220" />Are you going out, Lord Arglay?<Node id="36251" />' <Node id="36253" />Chloe asked.<Node id="36265" />

<Node id="36267" />'<Node id="36268" />Certainly not,' the Chief Justice said.<Node id="36307" /> '<Node id="36309" />I am going to lie in my
deepest armchair and read _When Anarchy came to London_, which has an
encouraging picture of the Law Courts being burnt on the cover.<Node id="36466" /> <Node id="36467" />Till
seven, then.<Node id="36484" />'<Node id="36485" />

<Node id="36487" />The dinner was largely occupied, much to Reginald's boredom, by Chloe's
account of what she had discovered about King Suleiman and Lord Arglay's
comments on it.<Node id="36647" /> <Node id="36648" />It seemed she had been right in her remembrance that
the Majesty of the King made its journeys accompanied by the Djinn, the
doctors of the law, and the viziers, upon a carpet which accommodated
its size to the King's needs.<Node id="36872" /> <Node id="36873" />But there were also tales of the Crown
and the Stone in the Crown, and (more general) of the Ring by virtue of
which the King understood all languages of men and beasts and Djinn and
governed all created things, save only the great Archangels themselves
who exist in immediate cognition of the Holy One.<Node id="37176" /> '<Node id="37178" />For,' said Chloe
thrilling, 'he was one of the four mighty ones--who were Nimrod and
Sheddad the Son of Ad, and Suleiman and Alexander; the first two being
infidels and the second two True Believers.<Node id="37377" />'<Node id="37378" />

<Node id="37380" />'<Node id="37381" />Alexander?<Node id="37391" />' <Node id="37393" />Arglay said in surprise.<Node id="37417" /> '<Node id="37419" />How jolly!<Node id="37429" /> <Node id="37430" />Perhaps Giles will
produce the helmet of the divine Alexander too.<Node id="37496" /> <Node id="37497" />We shall have a regular
archaeological evening, I expect.<Node id="37554" /> <Node id="37555" />Well, come along, _Malbrouck s'en va
t'en guerre_....<Node id="37608" />' <Node id="37610" />He carried them off to the car.<Node id="37641" />

<Node id="37643" />Sir Giles received the party with an almost Christ-like, 'What went ye
out for to see?<Node id="37729" />' <Node id="37731" />air, but he made no demur about producing the Crown for
their examination.<Node id="37805" /> <Node id="37806" />The Chief Justice, after examining it, showed it to
Chloe.<Node id="37864" />

<Node id="37866" />'<Node id="37867" />And the markings?<Node id="37884" />' <Node id="37886" />he asked her.<Node id="37899" />

<Node id="37901" />Chloe said nervously, 'O you know them, Lord Arglay.<Node id="37953" />'<Node id="37954" />

<Node id="37956" />'<Node id="37957" />I know they are Hebrew,' the Chief Justice said, 'and I know that Sir
Giles is sneering at me in his heart.<Node id="38064" /> <Node id="38065" />But I haven't an idea what they
are.<Node id="38101" />'<Node id="38102" />

<Node id="38104" />'<Node id="38105" />I suppose you've never had a Hebrew Rabbi before you?<Node id="38158" />' <Node id="38160" />Sir Giles said.<Node id="38175" />
'<Node id="38177" />That's how you judges become educated men, isn't it?<Node id="38229" /> <Node id="38230" />The letters----'<Node id="38246" />

<Node id="38248" />'<Node id="38249" />I asked Miss Burnett, Giles,' Lord Arglay interrupted, and Sir Giles
with a shrug waited.<Node id="38338" />

<Node id="38340" />'<Node id="38341" />They are the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, the Divine Name,'
Chloe said still more nervously.<Node id="38440" /> '<Node id="38442" />Yod, He, Vau, He.<Node id="38459" /> <Node id="38460" />I found it out this
afternoon,' she said suddenly to Sir Giles, 'in an encyclopedia.<Node id="38544" />'<Node id="38545" />

<Node id="38547" />'<Node id="38548" />Some of us write encyclopedias,' Arglay said, '--that's you, Giles;
some of us read them--that's you, Miss Burnett; some of us own
them--that's me; and some of us despise them--that's you, Reginald.<Node id="38746" />'<Node id="38747" />

<Node id="38749" />'<Node id="38750" />Encyclopedias are like slums,' Giles said, 'the rotten homes of
diseased minds.<Node id="38829" /> <Node id="38830" />But even Hoxton has to pretend to live, it thinks, and
of course it doesn't know it stinks.<Node id="38921" />'<Node id="38922" />

<Node id="38924" />Arglay was looking at the letters.<Node id="38958" /> '<Node id="38960" />The Divine Name,' he said musingly.<Node id="38995" />
'<Node id="38997" />Yod, He, Vau, He.<Node id="39014" /> <Node id="39015" />Umph.<Node id="39020" /> <Node id="39021" />Well....<Node id="39029" /> <Node id="39030" />We were going to experiment, weren't
we?<Node id="39070" />' <Node id="39072" />he added, almost as if recovering himself.<Node id="39114" /> '<Node id="39116" />Who begins?<Node id="39127" /> <Node id="39128" />Reginald,
suppose you show us.<Node id="39158" />'<Node id="39159" />

<Node id="39161" />'<Node id="39162" />Certainly,' Montague said.<Node id="39188" /> '<Node id="39190" />Now look here, uncle, let's really show
you.<Node id="39234" /> <Node id="39235" />Tell me something I can bring you from your study.<Node id="39285" />'<Node id="39286" />

<Node id="39288" />'<Node id="39289" />Bring me the pages of manuscript on the small table by the window,'
Arglay answered at once.<Node id="39381" /> '<Node id="39383" />The top one is marked _Chapter IV_.<Node id="39418" />'<Node id="39419" />

<Node id="39421" />Montague nodded and taking the Crown put it on his head; he settled
it comfortably, then taking a step or two backwards sat down in
the nearest convenient chair.<Node id="39582" /> <Node id="39583" />Lord Arglay watched him attentively,
occasionally darting his eyes sideways towards Sir Giles, who--as if
bored with the repetition of a concluded experiment--had turned to the
papers on which he had previously been working.<Node id="39807" /> <Node id="39808" />Chloe suddenly caught
Arglay's arm; he put up his other hand and pressed hers.<Node id="39886" /> <Node id="39887" />At once they
found themselves looking at an empty chair.<Node id="39943" /> <Node id="39944" />Chloe cried out; Arglay took
a step towards the chair.<Node id="39998" /> <Node id="39999" />Sir Giles, looking round, said casually; 'I
shouldn't get in the way; he may be back at any moment, and you might
get a nasty knock.<Node id="40131" />'<Node id="40132" />

<Node id="40134" />'<Node id="40135" />Well, I'm damned,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="40171" /> '<Node id="40173" />It's all----' he began, looking
at Chloe, but, impressed by the vivid excitement that possessed her,
ceased in the middle of the reassuring phrase he had begun.<Node id="40333" /> <Node id="40334" />They waited
in silence.<Node id="40357" />

<Node id="40359" />It was only about two or three minutes before, suddenly, they saw
Reginald Montague again in front of them.<Node id="40466" /> <Node id="40467" />He sat still for another
minute or two, then he stepped forward and gave the Chief Justice
several pages of manuscript.<Node id="40586" /> '<Node id="40588" />Well, uncle?<Node id="40600" />' <Node id="40602" />he asked triumphantly.<Node id="40624" />

<Node id="40626" />Arglay took the papers and looked at them.<Node id="40668" /> <Node id="40669" />They were those on which he
had been making notes that afternoon, and he had, he knew, left them
on his table.<Node id="40779" /> <Node id="40780" />He turned them over in silence.<Node id="40811" /> <Node id="40812" />Chloe released his arm
suddenly and sat down.<Node id="40857" /> <Node id="40858" />Sir Giles strolled back to them.<Node id="40890" /> '<Node id="40892" />Interesting
exhibit, what?<Node id="40918" />' <Node id="40920" />he said.<Node id="40928" />

<Node id="40930" />The Chief Justice's mind admitted the apparent fact.<Node id="40982" /> <Node id="40983" />It was impossible,
but it had happened.<Node id="41022" /> <Node id="41023" />In less than five minutes these papers had been
brought from Lancaster Gate to Ealing.<Node id="41109" /> <Node id="41110" />He loosed the little sigh which
always preceded his giving judgement and nodded.<Node id="41190" /> '<Node id="41192" />I don't know whether
it's the Crown of Suleiman, Giles,' he said, 'or some fantasia of your
own.<Node id="41288" /> <Node id="41289" />But it certainly seems to work.<Node id="41320" />'<Node id="41321" />

<Node id="41323" />'<Node id="41324" />What about trying it, uncle?<Node id="41352" />' <Node id="41354" />Reginald said invitingly, removing the
gold circlet from his head and holding it out.<Node id="41439" /> '<Node id="41441" />It's quite simple.<Node id="41459" /> <Node id="41460" />You
just put it on and wish firmly to go--wherever you choose.<Node id="41522" />'<Node id="41523" />

<Node id="41525" />'<Node id="41526" />Wishing firmly is a very difficult thing,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="41586" /> '<Node id="41588" />But if
you can I suppose I can.<Node id="41619" />' <Node id="41621" />He took the Crown and looked at Chloe.<Node id="41659" /> '<Node id="41661" />Where
shall I go, Miss Burnett?<Node id="41692" />' <Node id="41694" />he asked.<Node id="41703" />

<Node id="41705" />'<Node id="41706" />Somewhere quiet,' Sir Giles interjected.<Node id="41746" /> '<Node id="41748" />If you choose the House of
Commons or London Bridge or anything like that you'll cause a sensation.<Node id="41847" />
<Node id="41848" />Try your--' he paused a moment, 'dining-room,' he added.<Node id="41904" />

<Node id="41906" />'<Node id="41907" />I'd rather go somewhere I didn't know,' Arglay said.<Node id="41959" />

<Node id="41961" />'<Node id="41962" />Go to my sitting-room, Lord Arglay,' Chloe put in swiftly.<Node id="42020" /> '<Node id="42022" />I don't
suppose you even remember what the address is.<Node id="42076" /> <Node id="42077" />On--let me think--on the
table is last week's _New Statesman_.<Node id="42139" />'<Node id="42140" />

<Node id="42142" />'<Node id="42143" />There isn't likely to be any other fellow there?<Node id="42191" />' <Node id="42193" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="42209" /> '<Node id="42211" />No?<Node id="42214" />
<Node id="42215" />All right, Arglay.<Node id="42233" /> <Node id="42234" />Better sit down; it's apt to jar you, they say.<Node id="42281" />
<Node id="42282" />Now--will yourself there.<Node id="42307" />'<Node id="42308" />

<Node id="42310" />Lord Arglay took the Crown in both hands and set it on his head.<Node id="42374" /> <Node id="42375" />Chloe
involuntarily compared the motion with Montague's.<Node id="42431" /> <Node id="42432" />Reginald had put it
on with one hand as if he were settling a cap; against his thin form the
Chief Justice's assured maturity stood like a dark magnificence.<Node id="42589" /> <Node id="42590" />He set
on the Crown as if he were accepting a challenge, and sat down as if
the Chief Justice of England were coming to some high trial, either of
another or of himself.<Node id="42759" /> <Node id="42760" />Chloe, used to seeing and hearing him when his
mind played easily with his surroundings, used to the light courtesy
with which he had always treated her, had rarely seen in him that rich
plenitude of power which seemed to make his office right and natural to
him.<Node id="43023" /> <Node id="43024" />Once or twice, when, in dictating his book, he had framed slowly
some difficult and significant paragraph, she had caught a hint of it,
but her attention then had been on her work and his words rather than
his person.<Node id="43241" /> <Node id="43242" />She held her breath as she looked, and her eyes met his.<Node id="43298" />
<Node id="43299" />They were fixed on her with a kind of abstract intimacy; she felt
at once more individual to him than ever before and yet as if the
individuality which he discerned was something of which she herself was
not yet conscious.<Node id="43521" /> <Node id="43522" />And while she looked back into them, thrilling to
that remote concentration, she found she was looking only at the chair,
and was brought back at once from that separate interaction to the
remembrance of their business.<Node id="43741" /> <Node id="43742" />She started with the shock, and both the
men in the room looked at her.<Node id="43813" />

<Node id="43815" />'<Node id="43816" />Don't be frightened,' Sir Giles said, with an effort controlling his
phrases, and 'It's all right, you know,' Montague added coldly.<Node id="43948" />

<Node id="43950" />'<Node id="43951" />I'm not frightened, thank you,' Chloe said, hating them both with a
sudden intensity, but she knew she lied.<Node id="44059" /> <Node id="44060" />She _was_ frightened; she was
frightened of them.<Node id="44109" /> <Node id="44110" />The Crown of Suleiman, the strange happenings, Lord
Arglay's movements--these were what had stirred her emotions and shaken
her, and those shaken emotions were loosed within her in a sudden
horror, yet of what she did not know.<Node id="44337" /> <Node id="44338" />It seemed as if there were two
combinations; one had vanished, and the other she loathed, but to that
she was suddenly abandoned.<Node id="44467" /> <Node id="44468" />It was ridiculous, it was insane.<Node id="44501" /> '<Node id="44503" />What on
earth are you afraid of?<Node id="44535" />' <Node id="44537" />she asked herself, 'do you think either of
them is going to assault you?<Node id="44609" />' <Node id="44611" />And beyond and despite herself, and as
if thinking of some assault she could not visualize or imagine she
answered, 'Yes, I do.<Node id="44738" />'<Node id="44739" />

<Node id="44741" />Lord Arglay, as he sat down wearing the Crown, had directed his eyes and
mind towards Chloe.<Node id="44833" /> <Node id="44834" />For the first few moments half a score of ordinary
irrelevant thoughts leapt in his mind.<Node id="44923" />

<Node id="44925" />She was efficient, she was rather good-looking, she was, under the
detached patience with which she took his dictation, avid of ideas and
facts, she was desirous--but of what Lord Arglay doubted if she knew and
was quite certain he did not.<Node id="45165" /> <Node id="45166" />He put the irrelevancies aside, by mere
habitual practice, held his mind empty and prepared, as if to receive
some important answer which could then be directed to its proper place
in the particular order to which it belonged, allowed the image of Chloe
Burnett and the thought of her home to enter, and shut his mind down on
them.<Node id="45497" /> <Node id="45498" />The Crown pressed on his forehead; he involuntarily united the
physical consciousness and the mental; either received the other.<Node id="45626" /> <Node id="45627" />His
interior purpose suddenly lost hold; a dizziness caught him, through
which he was aware only of a dominating attraction--his being yearned to
some power above, around, within him.<Node id="45810" /> <Node id="45811" />The dizziness increased and then
was gone; his head ached; the Stone pressed heavily on it, then more
lightly.<Node id="45921" /> <Node id="45922" />He found himself opening his eyes.<Node id="45956" />

<Node id="45958" />He opened them on a strange room, and realized that he was standing by
the door.<Node id="46038" /> <Node id="46039" />It was a not too well furnished room--not, obviously, his own
kind.<Node id="46106" /> <Node id="46107" />There were two comfortable armchairs; there was a book-case; a
table; another chair; pictures; a little reproduction of the Victory
of Samothrace, a poor Buddha, a vase or two.<Node id="46283" /> <Node id="46284" />On the table a box of
cigarettes and a matchbox; some sort of needlework; a book; the _New
Statesman_.<Node id="46386" /> <Node id="46387" />Lord Arglay drew a deep breath.<Node id="46418" /> <Node id="46419" />So it worked.<Node id="46432" /> <Node id="46433" />He walked to
the table, then he went over to the window and looked out.<Node id="46504" /> <Node id="46505" />It was the
ordinary suburban street, a few ordinary people--three men, a woman,
four children.<Node id="46599" /> <Node id="46600" />He felt the curtains--they seemed actual.<Node id="46641" /> <Node id="46642" />He felt himself
with the same result.<Node id="46679" /> <Node id="46680" />He went back to the table and picked up the _New
Statesman_, then he sat down in one of the comfortable chairs as if to
consider.<Node id="46809" /> <Node id="46810" />But as he leant back against the cushions he remembered that
the experiment was only half done; he could consider afterwards.<Node id="46935" /> <Node id="46936" />The
immediate thing was to return with the paper; if that were done, all
was done that could be at the moment.<Node id="47046" /> '<Node id="47048" />I wish there were someone here
to speak to,' he thought.<Node id="47104" /> '<Node id="47106" />I wonder--I suppose they would see me.<Node id="47144" />'
<Node id="47146" />He thought of going down into the street and asking his way to some
imaginary road, but the difficulty in passing anyone outside Chloe
Burnett's room occurred to him and he desisted.<Node id="47328" /> <Node id="47329" />Return, then.<Node id="47342" /> <Node id="47343" />He gripped
the _New Statesman_ tightly, and began to think of Sir Giles at Ealing.<Node id="47425" />
<Node id="47426" />But the notion of introducing Sir Giles offended him; so, almost as
much, did the thought of Reginald Montague, and he was content at last
to make an image, as near as possible, of the room from which he had
come, with the thought of his secretary attached to it.<Node id="47689" /> '<Node id="47691" />My dear
child,' Lord Arglay said unconsciously, and shut his eyes.<Node id="47757" />

<Node id="47759" />When, after a similar play of feeling to that which he had experienced
before, he opened them to see Reginald Montague in front of him there
flashed across his mind the idea that the Crown had somehow muddled
things.<Node id="47975" /> <Node id="47976" />But it was gone as he came to himself and recognized that he
had indeed returned.<Node id="48057" /> <Node id="48058" />He looked at his watch; the whole episode had taken
exactly five minutes.<Node id="48131" /> <Node id="48132" />He sat for a minute, then he got up, walked across
to Chloe and gave her the paper.<Node id="48215" /> '<Node id="48217" />Yours, I think, Miss Burnett?<Node id="48246" /> <Node id="48247" />I'm
sorry to give you the trouble of carrying it back,' he said, and
wondered whether he had only imagined the look of relief in her eyes.<Node id="48385" />
'<Node id="48387" />Well,' he went on to the other two, 'it seems you're quite right.<Node id="48452" /> <Node id="48453" />I
don't know what happens or how, but if this sort of thing can go on
indefinitely, space doesn't exist--for purposes of travel.<Node id="48581" />'<Node id="48582" />

<Node id="48584" />'<Node id="48585" />You see it?<Node id="48596" />' <Node id="48598" />Reginald cried out.<Node id="48617" />

<Node id="48619" />'<Node id="48620" />Certainly I see it,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="48662" /> '<Node id="48664" />It's a little startling at
first and I want to know several more things, but they can wait.<Node id="48755" /> <Node id="48756" />At the
moment I have enough to brood on.<Node id="48796" /> <Node id="48797" />But we're forgetting our duty.<Node id="48827" /> <Node id="48828" />Miss
Burnett, wouldn't you like to try the ...<Node id="48874" /> <Node id="48875" />to put on the Crown of
Suleiman?<Node id="48907" />'<Node id="48908" />

<Node id="48910" />'<Node id="48911" />No,' said Chloe.<Node id="48927" /> '<Node id="48929" />No, thank you, Lord Arglay.<Node id="48956" /> <Node id="48957" />Thank you all very much,
but I think I had better go.<Node id="49010" />'<Node id="49011" />

<Node id="49013" />'<Node id="49014" />Go--at once?<Node id="49026" />' <Node id="49028" />Arglay asked, 'But give me a few more minutes and we'll
all go back together.<Node id="49105" />'<Node id="49106" />

<Node id="49108" />'<Node id="49109" />I shouldn't press Miss Burnett to stop if she wants to go,' Sir Giles
said.<Node id="49184" /> '<Node id="49186" />The station is about the fourth turning on the right.<Node id="49239" />'<Node id="49240" />

<Node id="49242" />'<Node id="49243" />Thank you, Sir Giles,' Chloe answered him.<Node id="49285" /> '<Node id="49287" />Thank you for showing me
the--the Crown.<Node id="49327" /> <Node id="49328" />Good night, Mr. Montague.<Node id="49353" /> <Node id="49354" />Good night, Lord Arglay.<Node id="49378" />'<Node id="49379" />

<Node id="49381" />'<Node id="49382" />All right, Giles,' Arglay stopped a movement Tumulty had not made.<Node id="49448" />
'<Node id="49450" />I'll see Miss Burnett out.<Node id="49476" />' <Node id="49478" />As the room door closed behind them he took
her arm.<Node id="49530" /> '<Node id="49532" />Why the rush?<Node id="49545" />' <Node id="49547" />he asked gently.<Node id="49563" />

<Node id="49565" />'<Node id="49566" />I don't ...<Node id="49577" /> <Node id="49578" />I don't really know,' Chloe said.<Node id="49611" /> '<Node id="49613" />I'm being rather silly
but I felt I couldn't stop there just now.<Node id="49678" /> <Node id="49679" />It is rather upsetting, isn't
it?<Node id="49712" /> <Node id="49713" />And ...<Node id="49720" /> <Node id="49721" />O I don't know.<Node id="49736" /> <Node id="49737" />I'm sorry to seem a fool.<Node id="49762" />'<Node id="49763" />

<Node id="49765" />'<Node id="49766" />You are not in the least like a fool,' the Chief Justice said equably.<Node id="49836" />
'<Node id="49838" />And you will tell me to-morrow what the matter is.<Node id="49888" /> <Node id="49889" />Are you sure you are
all right now?<Node id="49924" />'<Node id="49925" />

<Node id="49927" />'<Node id="49928" />Quite all right,' Chloe said as he opened the door for her.<Node id="49987" /> '<Node id="49989" />Yes,
really, Lord Arglay.<Node id="50014" />' <Node id="50016" />She added with a sudden rush of temper, 'I don't
like Sir Giles.<Node id="50080" />'<Node id="50081" />

<Node id="50083" />'<Node id="50084" />I couldn't,' Arglay smiled at her, 'have much use for a secretary who
_did_ like Sir Giles.<Node id="50175" /> <Node id="50176" />Or Reginald either, for that matter.<Node id="50212" /> <Node id="50213" />A vulture and
a crow--but that's between ourselves.<Node id="50264" /> <Node id="50265" />Well, if you will go, good-night.<Node id="50298" />'<Node id="50299" />

<Node id="50301" />'<Node id="50302" />Good-night,' Chloe said, took a step forward, and looked back suddenly.<Node id="50373" />
'<Node id="50375" />You aren't going to try it again yourself?<Node id="50417" />'<Node id="50418" />

<Node id="50420" />'<Node id="50421" />Not I,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="50446" /> '<Node id="50448" />I'm going to talk to them a little and then
go.<Node id="50495" /> <Node id="50496" />No more aerial flights to-day.<Node id="50526" /> <Node id="50527" />Till to-morrow then.<Node id="50547" />' <Node id="50549" />He watched her
out of the gate and well along the street before he returned to the
others.<Node id="50639" />

<Node id="50641" />He discovered then that Reginald had not been wasting his time.<Node id="50704" />

<Node id="50706" />Anxious to lay hands as soon as possible on some of the colossal
fortune that seemed to be waiting, the young man had extracted
permission from Sir Giles to make an effort to remove a small chip from
the Stone, and had been away to bring a chisel and hammer from the
tool-box.<Node id="50982" /> <Node id="50983" />Arglay looked at Tumulty.<Node id="51008" />

<Node id="51010" />'<Node id="51011" />You're sure it won't damage it?<Node id="51042" />' <Node id="51044" />he asked.<Node id="51053" />

<Node id="51055" />'<Node id="51056" />They all say it won't,' Sir Giles answered.<Node id="51099" /> '<Node id="51101" />The fellow I had it from
and Ali Khan who was here the other night and the manuscripts and all.<Node id="51196" />
<Node id="51197" />The manuscripts are rather hush-hush about it--all damnably veiled and
hinting.<Node id="51276" /> "<Node id="51278" />The division is accomplished yet the Stone is unchanged, and
the virtues are neither here nor there but allwhere"--that kind of
thing.<Node id="51412" /> <Node id="51413" />They rather suggest that people who get the bits had better look
out, but that's Reginald's business--and his covey of company-promoters.<Node id="51550" />
<Node id="51551" />He'd better have a clause in the agreement about not being responsible
for any damage to life or limb, but it's not my affair.<Node id="51677" /> _<Node id="51679" />I_ don't care
what happens to them.<Node id="51714" />'<Node id="51715" />

<Node id="51717" />'<Node id="51718" />Who is this Ali Khan?<Node id="51739" />' <Node id="51741" />Arglay asked, watching Reginald arrange the
Stone conveniently.<Node id="51804" />

<Node id="51806" />'<Node id="51807" />A fellow from the Persian Embassy,' Sir Giles told him.<Node id="51862" /> '<Node id="51864" />He was on to
me almost as soon as I reached England, wanting to buy it back.<Node id="51940" /> <Node id="51941" />So I had
him out here to talk to him about it, but he couldn't tell me anything I
didn't know or guess already.<Node id="52052" />'<Node id="52053" />

<Node id="52055" />Reginald struck the chisel with the hammer, and almost fell forward on
to the table.<Node id="52139" /> <Node id="52140" />For, unexpectedly, since the Stone had been hard enough
to the touch, it yielded instantaneously to the blow, and, as Reginald
straightened himself with an oath, they saw, lying on the table by the
side of the Crown, a second Stone apparently the same in all respects as
the first.<Node id="52421" />

<Node id="52423" />'<Node id="52424" />Good God!<Node id="52433" />' <Node id="52435" />Lord Arglay exclaimed, while Reginald gazed open-mouthed
at the result of his work and Sir Giles broke into a cackle of high
laughter.<Node id="52569" /> <Node id="52570" />But they all gathered round the table to stare.<Node id="52617" />

<Node id="52619" />Except that one Stone was in the Crown and the other not they could not
find any difference.<Node id="52711" /> <Node id="52712" />There was the same milky colour, flaked here and
there with gold, the same jet-black markings which might be letters and
might be only accidental colouring, the same size, the same apparent
hardness.<Node id="52911" />

<Node id="52913" />'"<Node id="52915" />The division is accomplished yet the Stone is unchanged,"' Lord Arglay
quoted at last, looking at his brother-in-law.<Node id="53032" /> '<Node id="53034" />It is, too.<Node id="53045" /> <Node id="53046" />This is all
very curious.<Node id="53071" />'<Node id="53072" />

<Node id="53074" />Tumulty had thrust Reginald aside and was peering at the two Stones.<Node id="53142" />
<Node id="53143" />After a minute, 'Try it again, Reginald,' he said--'the new one, not
the old.<Node id="53220" /> <Node id="53221" />Come round here, Arglay.<Node id="53245" />' <Node id="53247" />He caught the Chief Justice by the
arm and brought him round the table.<Node id="53318" /> '<Node id="53320" />There,' he said, 'now watch.<Node id="53348" />' <Node id="53350" />He
himself, while Lord Arglay leant forward over the table, moved a step or
two off and squatted down on his heels, so that his eyes were on a level
with the Stone.<Node id="53514" /> '<Node id="53516" />Now slowly, Reginald, slowly.<Node id="53545" />'<Node id="53546" />

<Node id="53548" />Montague adjusted it, set the chisel on it, raised the hammer and
struck, but this time with less force.<Node id="53652" /> <Node id="53653" />The watchers saw the chisel move
down through the Stone which seemed to divide easily before it and fall
asunder on both sides.<Node id="53780" /> <Node id="53781" />Sir Giles scrambled to his feet and he and Lord
Arglay leaned breathlessly forward.<Node id="53864" /> <Node id="53865" />There on the table, exactly alike,
lay two Stones, each a faithful replica of its original in the Crown.<Node id="53969" />

<Node id="53971" />Montague put the chisel and hammer down and stepped back.<Node id="54028" /> '<Node id="54030" />I say,' he
said, 'I don't like this.<Node id="54066" /> <Node id="54067" />Stones don't grow out of one another in this
way.<Node id="54116" /> <Node id="54117" />It's ...<Node id="54125" /> <Node id="54126" />it's uncanny.<Node id="54139" />'<Node id="54140" />

<Node id="54142" />'<Node id="54143" />Stones don't carry you five miles through the air and back usually,'
Arglay said drily.<Node id="54230" /> '<Node id="54232" />I think you're straining at a gnat.<Node id="54267" /> <Node id="54268" />Still...<Node id="54276" />' <Node id="54278" />The
perfect ease with which the Stone had recreated itself, a ghastly
feeling of its capacity to go on producing copies of itself to infinity,
the insane simplicity, the grotesque finality, of the result, weighed on
his mind, and he fell silent.<Node id="54523" />

<Node id="54525" />Sir Giles, alert and eager, picked them up.<Node id="54568" /> '<Node id="54570" />Just a moment,' he said,
'let me weigh them.<Node id="54614" />'<Node id="54615" />

<Node id="54617" />He went to a corner of the room where a small balance stood in a glass
case, and put one of the Stones on the scales.<Node id="54734" /> <Node id="54735" />For a minute he stared at
it, then he looked over his shoulder at the Chief Justice.<Node id="54819" />

<Node id="54821" />'<Node id="54822" />I say, Arglay,' he cried, 'it doesn't weigh anything.<Node id="54875" />'<Node id="54876" />

<Node id="54878" />'<Node id="54879" />Doesn't weigh----' Lord Arglay went across to him.<Node id="54929" /> <Node id="54930" />The Stone lay in the
middle of the scale, which remained perfectly poised, balanced against
its fellow, apparently unweighted by what it bore.<Node id="55072" />

<Node id="55074" />'<Node id="55075" />But----' Arglay said, 'but----But it _does_ weigh....<Node id="55128" /> <Node id="55129" />I mean I can feel
its pressure if I hold it.<Node id="55173" /> <Node id="55174" />Very light, but definite.<Node id="55199" />'<Node id="55200" />

<Node id="55202" />'<Node id="55203" />Well, there you are,' Giles said.<Node id="55236" /> '<Node id="55238" />Look at it.<Node id="55249" />' <Node id="55251" />With the tweezers he
picked up a gramme weight and dropped it on the other scale, which
immediately sank gently under it.<Node id="55372" />

<Node id="55374" />'<Node id="55375" />There,' he said, 'the balances are all right.<Node id="55420" /> <Node id="55421" />It just doesn't weigh.<Node id="55443" />'
<Node id="55445" />He took up the Stone and they returned to the table, where all three
stood staring at the marvel, until Sir Giles grew impatient.<Node id="55574" />

<Node id="55576" />'<Node id="55577" />We look like Hottentots staring at an aeroplane,' he said.<Node id="55635" /> '<Node id="55637" />Reginald,
you baboon-headed cockatoo, show a little gratitude.<Node id="55699" /> <Node id="55700" />Here instead of a
mere chip you can give every one of your degenerate Jew millionaires a
stone as big as the first one, and you stand gaping like a cow with the
foot-and-mouth disease.<Node id="55884" />'<Node id="55885" />

<Node id="55887" />Reginald made an effort at recovery.<Node id="55923" /> '<Node id="55925" />Yes,' he answered rather
quaveringly, 'yes, of course I see that.<Node id="55990" /> <Node id="55991" />It made me feel funny somehow.<Node id="56021" />
<Node id="56022" />But--yes, of course.<Node id="56042" /> <Node id="56043" />It'll save any difficulty about chipping the
original, and they'll look much better--much.<Node id="56133" /> <Node id="56134" />Can I leave them here
to-night?<Node id="56165" />'<Node id="56166" />

<Node id="56168" />'<Node id="56169" />Why, you're scared out of what wits you've got,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="56233" /> '<Node id="56235" />What
about you, Arglay?<Node id="56258" /> <Node id="56259" />Will you have one?<Node id="56277" />'<Node id="56278" />

<Node id="56280" />'<Node id="56281" />No,' Lord Arglay said soberly.<Node id="56311" /> '<Node id="56313" />I think not; not to-night.<Node id="56339" /> <Node id="56340" />I feel
rather as if I'd been scared out of what wits I'd got, and was just
getting over it.<Node id="56431" /> <Node id="56432" />If I were you, Reginald, I should think a great many
times before I started that transport scheme of yours.<Node id="56539" />'<Node id="56540" />

<Node id="56542" />'<Node id="56543" />Eh?<Node id="56546" />' <Node id="56548" />said Reginald.<Node id="56562" /> '<Node id="56564" />But surely Sir Giles is right?<Node id="56594" /> <Node id="56595" />This'll make it
even easier.<Node id="56623" />'<Node id="56624" />

<Node id="56626" />'<Node id="56627" />Just as you like,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="56663" /> '<Node id="56665" />I think I will go now, Tumulty.<Node id="56696" /> <Node id="56697" />I
should like to come and see it again soon, if I may.<Node id="56751" />'<Node id="56752" />

<Node id="56754" />Sir Giles nodded casually, and as casually bade his visitors good-night.<Node id="56826" />

<Node id="56828" />On the way back to town Lord Arglay said very little, and ignored
Reginald's occasional outbreaks of mingled hope and nervousness.<Node id="56958" /> <Node id="56959" />He
found himself wishing Chloe Burnett had not gone; he would have liked
to have his own silence buttressed by another instead of harassed by a
futile and spasmodic volubility.<Node id="57135" /> <Node id="57136" />His mind gazed blankly at the riddle of
the three Stones in an awe which he usually kept for Organic Law.<Node id="57241" /> <Node id="57242" />There
must be some conclusion, he felt, but he couldn't think--not yet.<Node id="57313" />
'--<Node id="57317" />pay even more,' he heard at his side and drove faster.<Node id="57371" /> '<Node id="57373" />Is there no
intelligent creature about?<Node id="57412" />' <Node id="57414" />he thought.<Node id="57425" /> '<Node id="57427" />I wish that girl hadn't--no,
perhaps it's as well.<Node id="57477" /> <Node id="57478" />Damn it, I'm muddled.<Node id="57499" />'<Node id="57500" />

<Node id="57502" />He reached his house almost at the same time that Chloe by a slower and
longer method came to her own, full of similar half-conscious anxieties
and alarms.<Node id="57657" /> <Node id="57658" />She found, opened, and read a couple of letters that awaited
her, and realized when she had finished that she knew nothing of their
contents, and did not particularly want to know.<Node id="57838" /> <Node id="57839" />She put down the _New
Statesman_ in its place on the table, took off her things, and looked
vaguely round the room.<Node id="57954" /> <Node id="57955" />It was here then that Lord Arglay had been
during that unbelievable and terrifying disappearance; to this the Crown
of Suleiman had transported him.<Node id="58103" /> <Node id="58104" />The Crown of Suleiman ...<Node id="58129" /> <Node id="58130" />the Lord
Chief Justice....<Node id="58156" /> <Node id="58157" />Chloe Burnett.<Node id="58171" /> <Node id="58172" />It might have happened but she didn't
believe it; at least, except that she couldn't disbelieve in that sharp
spasm of fear.<Node id="58296" /> <Node id="58297" />She moved towards a chair and noticed, with a slight
annoyance, that she had forgotten to shake the cushions up when she left
the house that evening.<Node id="58446" /> <Node id="58447" />Or had another visitor----?<Node id="58474" /> <Node id="58475" />Chloe dropped into
the chair where Lord Arglay had sat and burst into tears.<Node id="58551" />




<Node id="58556" />CHAPTER III<Node id="58567" />

<Node id="58569" />THE TALE OF THE END OF DESIRE<Node id="58598" />


<Node id="58601" />When Miss Burnett arrived at the Chief Justice's house the next morning
she found him reading his correspondence in a perfectly normal way.<Node id="58740" /> <Node id="58741" />He
looked up to welcome her and considered her carefully.<Node id="58798" /> '<Node id="58800" />No worse?<Node id="58809" />' <Node id="58811" />he
said.<Node id="58819" /> '<Node id="58821" />Good night?<Node id="58832" /> <Node id="58833" />Well, you missed something even more eerie.<Node id="58876" />'<Node id="58877" />

<Node id="58879" />'<Node id="58880" />O Lord Arglay!<Node id="58894" /> <Node id="58895" />Nothing happened?<Node id="58912" />'<Node id="58913" />

<Node id="58915" />'<Node id="58916" />Something happened all right,' Arglay answered, and his face grew
grave.<Node id="58988" /> '<Node id="58990" />Up to last night,' he went on, 'I thought Giles was monkeying
about with something, and playing tricks on Reginald for some infernal
reason of his own.<Node id="59141" /> <Node id="59142" />But I don't know now; I really don't.<Node id="59179" /> <Node id="59180" />He didn't seem
to expect what did happen.<Node id="59221" />'<Node id="59222" />

<Node id="59224" />'<Node id="59225" />But, Lord Arglay!<Node id="59242" /> <Node id="59243" />What did?<Node id="59252" />'<Node id="59253" />

<Node id="59255" />The Chief Justice told her.<Node id="59282" /> <Node id="59283" />Chloe sat gazing at him.<Node id="59307" /> '<Node id="59309" />It multiplies
itself?<Node id="59330" />' <Node id="59332" />she breathed.<Node id="59345" /> '<Node id="59347" />But it must be something--magical, then.<Node id="59387" />
<Node id="59388" />Something unnatural.<Node id="59408" />'<Node id="59409" />

<Node id="59411" />Arglay shook his head.<Node id="59433" /> '<Node id="59435" />I wouldn't say that,' he answered.<Node id="59469" /> '<Node id="59471" />Atoms do it,
or electrons, or something.<Node id="59511" /> <Node id="59512" />But I admit to having a nasty jar when I
saw the three things all exactly alike.<Node id="59592" /> <Node id="59593" />Somehow the sight of Reginald
producing stones of Suleiman ben Daood at the rate of two a minute with
a chisel--it didn't seem decent.<Node id="59727" />'<Node id="59728" />

<Node id="59730" />'<Node id="59731" />That,' Chloe said with conviction, 'is what I felt; that's why I ran
away.<Node id="59805" /> <Node id="59806" />Lord Arglay, could...<Node id="59827" />' <Node id="59829" />she hesitated, 'could those letters be
real?<Node id="59873" />'<Node id="59874" />

<Node id="59876" />'<Node id="59877" />If they are, if the Stone is,' the Chief Justice said, 'it looks as
if it were real in another manner--more or less real than we are.<Node id="60010" /> <Node id="60011" />No,
that's absurd, of course.<Node id="60040" /> <Node id="60041" />There can't be degrees in Reality.<Node id="60075" /> <Node id="60076" />But we know
that we can pass through space by its means--we both know that--and I
have seen what was one become two, and then three, and lose nothing in
the process.<Node id="60241" /> <Node id="60242" />And now this morning...<Node id="60265" />' <Node id="60267" />He gave her a letter and she
read--<Node id="60302" />


                                            <Node id="60349" />'_<Node id="60351" />Foreign Office_,<Node id="60367" />

                                                     <Node id="60422" />'_10 <Node id="60427" />May_.<Node id="60432" />

    <Node id="60438" />'<Node id="60439" />MY DEAR CHIEF JUSTICE,
     'I wonder if you could spare me a few minutes to-day, and if so
     whether you would mind ringing up and making an appointment.<Node id="60596" />
     <Node id="60602" />Nothing to do with you directly, but the fact is we have been
     approached--very tentatively--on a little matter relating to your
     brother-in-law Sir Giles Tumulty.<Node id="60773" /> <Node id="60774" />And as, on the few occasions
     when I've met him, he always seemed to me rather a difficult man
     to deal with, I thought my way might be smoother if I could have
     a chat with you first.<Node id="60970" /> <Node id="60971" />Pray forgive me for troubling you.<Node id="61005" />

                              <Node id="61037" />'<Node id="61038" />Yours very truly,<Node id="61055" />

                               <Node id="61088" />'<Node id="61089" />J. BRUCE CUMBERLAND.<Node id="61109" />'<Node id="61110" />


<Node id="61113" />Miss Burnett looked up.<Node id="61136" /> '<Node id="61138" />You think it's the same thing?<Node id="61168" />'<Node id="61169" />

<Node id="61171" />'<Node id="61172" />I shouldn't wonder,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="61214" /> '<Node id="61216" />Of course it may not be.<Node id="61240" />
<Node id="61241" />Giles always seems to be conducting several lines of research at once,
some perfectly harmless and one or two perfectly loathsome.<Node id="61371" /> <Node id="61372" />But the F.O.
has had trouble with him once or twice before--obscure troubles no one
seemed to know the rights of, except Giles who (it is said) was the
proximate cause of one Secretary's resignation.<Node id="61571" /> <Node id="61572" />I don't wonder Bruce
Cumberland hesitates to tackle him.<Node id="61628" />'<Node id="61629" />

<Node id="61631" />'<Node id="61632" />Who is Mr. Cumberland?<Node id="61654" />' <Node id="61656" />Chloe asked.<Node id="61668" />

<Node id="61670" />'<Node id="61671" />One of the smaller great guns there,' Arglay told her.<Node id="61725" /> '<Node id="61727" />A Permanent
Official in many impermanent offices.<Node id="61776" /> <Node id="61777" />But I've rung up already and made
an appointment for twelve.<Node id="61837" /> <Node id="61838" />I want----'<Node id="61849" />

<Node id="61851" />There was a tap at the door and a maid came in.<Node id="61898" /> '<Node id="61900" />Sir Giles Tumulty would
like to see you, my lord,' she said.<Node id="61960" />

<Node id="61962" />'<Node id="61963" />Sir Giles----?<Node id="61977" /> <Node id="61978" />O bring him in, bring him in,' Arglay said and met the
visitor at the door.<Node id="62053" /> '<Node id="62055" />Hallo, Tumulty, what brings you here so early?<Node id="62101" />' <Node id="62103" />he
asked.<Node id="62112" />

<Node id="62114" />Sir Giles came briskly in, threw Chloe a glance, and sat down.<Node id="62176" /> '<Node id="62178" />Three
things,' he said.<Node id="62201" /> '<Node id="62203" />My house was burgled last night, I'm going to
Birmingham to-day, and I want to warn you, or rather other people
through you.<Node id="62327" />'<Node id="62328" />

<Node id="62330" />'<Node id="62331" />Burgled?<Node id="62339" />' <Node id="62341" />Arglay said.<Node id="62353" /> '<Node id="62355" />Casually or deliberately?<Node id="62380" /> <Node id="62381" />And by whom, or don't
you know?<Node id="62412" />'<Node id="62413" />

<Node id="62415" />'<Node id="62416" />Of course I know,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="62450" /> '<Node id="62452" />It's the Embassy people; I
shouldn't be a bit surprised to find Ali Khan did it himself.<Node id="62540" /> <Node id="62541" />I'm only
surprised they didn't try to tackle me.<Node id="62589" /> <Node id="62590" />They did it pretty well on the
whole, felt under my pillow while I was trying not to snigger, and went
all over the study, got what safe there is open, and made very little
noise.<Node id="62769" /> <Node id="62770" />I dare say I shouldn't have heard them if I hadn't been awake.<Node id="62832" />'<Node id="62833" />

<Node id="62835" />'<Node id="62836" />Did they get what they wanted?<Node id="62866" />' <Node id="62868" />Arglay asked.<Node id="62881" />

<Node id="62883" />'<Node id="62884" />Get it?<Node id="62891" />' <Node id="62893" />Sir Giles almost shrieked.<Node id="62919" /> '<Node id="62921" />Do you suppose, Arglay, that any
set of half-caste earthworms would find anything I wanted to hide?<Node id="63020" /> <Node id="63021" />No,
they didn't.<Node id="63037" /> <Node id="63038" />Suleiman and I are going off to see Palliser at Birmingham
to-day.<Node id="63104" /> <Node id="63105" />But I thought I'd leave one of those little fellows with you and
one with Reginald.<Node id="63188" /> <Node id="63189" />I've dropped his in on him and here's yours.<Node id="63233" />' <Node id="63235" />He
pulled one of the Stones from his pocket and threw it on to the table.<Node id="63308" />
'<Node id="63310" />And now for the warning.<Node id="63334" /> <Node id="63335" />You're mixed up with all this Whitehall crowd
of simians, Arglay, and for all I know the Persians may be trying to
pull the strings they dance to.<Node id="63481" /> <Node id="63482" />Well, if you hear anything about it,
tell them to be careful.<Node id="63543" /> <Node id="63544" />For if they try to get the Crown out of me
they'll get more than they want.<Node id="63619" /> <Node id="63620" />Tell them if they give me any trouble
I'll make enough Stones to build a wall round London.<Node id="63711" /> <Node id="63712" />I'll sell them at
two a penny to the children in the streets.<Node id="63773" /> <Node id="63774" />I'll set up a Woolworth's to
show nothing but Stones.<Node id="63827" /> <Node id="63828" />The whole population of this blasted sink you
call London shall be playing hop-scotch with them.<Node id="63924" /> <Node id="63925" />I'll give them relics
enough, and you tell them so.<Node id="63976" /> <Node id="63977" />I've written to Ali Khan warning him and
referring him to you for confirmation.<Node id="64056" />' <Node id="64058" />He started to go, and stopped.<Node id="64088" />
'<Node id="64090" />O and if they try and get me knocked on the head _that_ won't help.<Node id="64157" /> <Node id="64158" />For
I'll leave it in proper keeping and I'll have a mausoleum of relics
built over me.<Node id="64244" /> <Node id="64245" />So they know.<Node id="64258" />'<Node id="64259" />

<Node id="64261" />With which Sir Giles flung out of the room, but he was back again before
Lord Arglay could say more than 'Cheery creature!<Node id="64383" />'<Node id="64384" />

<Node id="64386" />'<Node id="64387" />My own advice to both of you,' he said, 'is to say nothing at all
whatever leprous hooligan from the Foreign Office or the Embassy you may
be pestered with.<Node id="64543" /> <Node id="64544" />You play your office, Arglay, and Miss Burnett can
play her sex.<Node id="64608" /> <Node id="64609" />Justice and innocence, that's your line, though I don't
suppose either of you's either.<Node id="64696" />'<Node id="64697" />

<Node id="64699" />He was gone again, this time for good, and they heard the front door
close.<Node id="64774" />

<Node id="64776" />'<Node id="64777" />Giles always reminds me of the old riddle,' Lord Arglay said in a
moment.<Node id="64850" /> '<Node id="64852" />Would you rather be more abominable than you sound or sound
more abominable than you are?<Node id="64941" /> <Node id="64942" />The answer is I would rather be neither
but I am both.<Node id="64996" /> <Node id="64997" />And now what do we do?<Node id="65019" />' <Node id="65021" />He looked at his watch.<Node id="65044" /> '<Node id="65046" />I go to
the Foreign Office,' he said, and considered.<Node id="65099" /> '<Node id="65101" />I think, Miss Burnett, if
anyone comes from the Persian Embassy you had better see them.<Node id="65189" /> <Node id="65190" />Don't
know anything; just be obliging.<Node id="65228" /> <Node id="65229" />I've asked you to take any message that
comes, to interview any callers--that sort of thing.<Node id="65321" /> <Node id="65322" />Lord Arglay was
particularly anxious--you know.<Node id="65369" /> <Node id="65370" />I'm not sure that I oughtn't to cut
adrift altogether, but there's Bruce Cumberland, and, as a matter of
fact, I'm horribly curious.<Node id="65502" /> <Node id="65503" />Well, I'll go.<Node id="65517" /> <Node id="65518" />I'll tell them to show anyone
from the Embassy in to you.<Node id="65575" /> <Node id="65576" />Good-bye, and good luck.<Node id="65600" /> <Node id="65601" />I shall be back to
lunch.<Node id="65626" />'<Node id="65627" />

<Node id="65629" />'<Node id="65630" />They may want you to lunch at the Foreign Office,' Chloe suggested.<Node id="65697" />

<Node id="65699" />'<Node id="65700" />Then I shan't,' Lord Arglay said firmly.<Node id="65740" /> '<Node id="65742" />We must talk the whole thing
over.<Node id="65776" /> <Node id="65777" />O and this?<Node id="65788" />' <Node id="65790" />He picked up the Stone.<Node id="65813" /> '<Node id="65815" />I think this shall go in my
private safe upstairs.<Node id="65865" /> <Node id="65866" />Good-bye.<Node id="65875" /> <Node id="65876" />You might sort out the notes for the
next chapter of _Organic Law_.<Node id="65943" />'<Node id="65944" />

<Node id="65946" />Chloe did her best, but even the thesis of law as a growing and developing
habit of the human mind, with its corollary of the distinction between
organic consciousness expressed in law and inorganic rules imposed from
without, failed to hold her.<Node id="66192" /> <Node id="66193" />It might be true that the whole body of
criminal law was, by its nature, inorganic, which was the point the
Chief Justice had reached, though whether in agreement or opposition
she had no idea, but she could not keep her mind away from what seemed
an organism of unexpected power.<Node id="66473" /> '<Node id="66475" />It must be alive,' she found herself
saying, and went on to ask herself, 'But then does it know?<Node id="66571" /> <Node id="66572" />Does it know
what it does and what we do to it?<Node id="66619" /> <Node id="66620" />Who ever heard of a living stone?<Node id="66653" />'
<Node id="66655" />She went on, nevertheless, thinking along that road.<Node id="66707" /> '<Node id="66709" />Does it know
what Mr. Montague is doing with it?<Node id="66757" /> <Node id="66758" />What else can it do?<Node id="66778" /> <Node id="66779" />and can it do
anything to us?<Node id="66808" />'<Node id="66809" />

<Node id="66811" />The maid came in.<Node id="66828" /> '<Node id="66830" />A gentleman from the Embassy is downstairs, Miss
Burnett,' she said.<Node id="66898" /> '<Node id="66900" />Lord Arglay told me to show him up.<Node id="66935" /> <Node id="66936" />Will that be
all right?<Node id="66959" />'<Node id="66960" />

<Node id="66962" />'<Node id="66963" />Certainly,' Chloe said nervously, 'yes, please bring him in.<Node id="67023" />'<Node id="67024" />

<Node id="67026" />In a minute the maid announced 'Mr.<Node id="67061" /> <Node id="67062" />Ibrahim,' and vanished.<Node id="67085" /> <Node id="67086" />A little old
gentleman, in Western dress but for his green turban, walked placidly
into the room.<Node id="67183" />

<Node id="67185" />'<Node id="67186" />Do sit down,' Chloe said, mastering her agitation.<Node id="67236" /> '<Node id="67238" />Probably the maid
told you that Lord Arglay was so sorry he had had to go out, but he
hoped you would be good enough to leave any message with me.<Node id="67384" /> <Node id="67385" />If
possible.<Node id="67397" />'<Node id="67398" />

<Node id="67400" />Hajji Ibrahim bowed and sat down.<Node id="67433" /> '<Node id="67435" />You know, I think, what I have come
about?<Node id="67477" />' <Node id="67479" />he said.<Node id="67487" />

<Node id="67489" />'<Node id="67490" />I'm sorry, but Lord Arglay didn't tell me--only that it might be rather
important,' Chloe answered.<Node id="67589" />

<Node id="67591" />The Hajji smiled slightly.<Node id="67617" /> '<Node id="67619" />I believe that Lord Arglay did not tell
you,' he said, 'but I think you must have seen something last night when
you went with him to Sir Giles Tumulty's house.<Node id="67779" />'<Node id="67780" />

<Node id="67782" />'<Node id="67783" />If you know that,' Chloe answered, disagreeably surprised, 'you will
know that I left before Lord Arglay and wasn't with him there--not for
long.<Node id="67928" />'<Node id="67929" />

<Node id="67931" />'<Node id="67932" />Long enough,' the Hajji nodded.<Node id="67963" /> '<Node id="67965" />Do not let us dispute on that, Miss
Burnett--it was Miss Burnett your servant said?<Node id="68048" />--<Node id="68050" />or we shall waste our
time and our spirit.<Node id="68092" /> <Node id="68093" />You know what it is we are seeking, though you may
not know all that it means.<Node id="68171" /> <Node id="68172" />It is the End of Desire.<Node id="68196" />'<Node id="68197" />

<Node id="68199" />'<Node id="68200" />The end of desire?<Node id="68218" />' <Node id="68220" />Chloe repeated.<Node id="68235" />

<Node id="68237" />'<Node id="68238" />It is called the White Stone and the Stone of Suleiman ben Daood (on
whom be the Peace!<Node id="68325" />),' <Node id="68329" />the Hajji went on, 'and it has other names also.<Node id="68377" />
<Node id="68378" />But that is its best name, as that is its best work.<Node id="68430" /> <Node id="68431" />Now that it is at
large in the world it may bring much sorrow.<Node id="68493" /> <Node id="68494" />I think Lord Arglay would
be wise to do what he can to bring it back.<Node id="68563" /> <Node id="68564" />No,' he added as he saw
Chloe about to make another effort at denial, 'you are acting in good
faith but it is quite useless.<Node id="68688" /> <Node id="68689" />I can see that you know the thing if not
the work.<Node id="68739" />'<Node id="68740" />

<Node id="68742" />'<Node id="68743" />If you have any definite message,' Chloe said, 'I shall be most careful
to give it to Lord Arglay.<Node id="68841" />'<Node id="68842" />

<Node id="68844" />'<Node id="68845" />I think you have a premonition of the message,' Hajji Ibrahim answered.<Node id="68916" />
'<Node id="68918" />Tell me, have you not seen certain of the marvels of the Stone and
are you not afraid in your heart?<Node id="69018" /> <Node id="69019" />Else why should you be so shaken at
speaking with me?<Node id="69072" />'<Node id="69073" />

<Node id="69075" />'<Node id="69076" />I am not shaken,' Chloe said indignantly.<Node id="69117" />

<Node id="69119" />The other smiled.<Node id="69136" /> '<Node id="69138" />Child,' he said, 'you have done what you can to be
loyal, but you cannot control your eyes, and there is fear at the back
of them now.<Node id="69272" /> <Node id="69273" />Do not fear us who serve the Stone but fear those who
attempt to rule it.<Node id="69346" />'<Node id="69347" />

<Node id="69349" />'<Node id="69350" />What is this Stone?<Node id="69369" />' <Node id="69371" />Chloe asked, hoping rather vainly that the
intensity of her feeling would sound like a mere business interest.<Node id="69481" />

<Node id="69483" />'<Node id="69484" />I will tell you what is said of it,' the Hajji said, 'and you shall
tell Lord Arglay when he returns.<Node id="69585" /> <Node id="69586" />It is said that in the Crown of
Suleiman ben Daood there was a strange and wonderful Stone, and it is
said also that this Stone had belonged of old to the giants, to Nimrod
the hunter and his children, and by its virtue Nimrod sought to build
Babel which was to reach to heaven.<Node id="69864" /> <Node id="69865" />And something of this kind is
certainly possible to those who have the Stone.<Node id="69942" /> <Node id="69943" />Before Nimrod, our
father Adam (the Peace be upon him!<Node id="69997" />) <Node id="69999" />had it, and this only he brought
with him out of Paradise when he fled before the swords of the great
ones--Michael and Gabriel and Raphael (blessed be they!<Node id="70156" />) <Node id="70158" />And there are
those who say that before then it was in the Crown of Iblis the Accursed
when he fell from heaven, and that his fall was not assured until that
Stone dropped from his head.<Node id="70344" /> <Node id="70345" />For yet again it is told that, when the
Merciful One made the worlds, first of all He created that Stone and
gave it to the Divine One whom the Jews call Shekinah, and as she gazed
upon it the universes arose and had being.<Node id="70568" /> <Node id="70569" />But afterwards it passed from
Iblis to Adam, and from Adam to Nimrod, and from Nimrod to Suleiman, and
after Suleiman it came into the sceptre of Octavianus who was called
C�sar and Augustus and was lord of Rome.<Node id="70781" /> <Node id="70782" />But from Rome it came with
Constantine to New Rome, and thence eastward--only in hiding--till our
lord Muhammed (blessed be he!<Node id="70909" />) <Node id="70911" />arose to proclaim the Unity.<Node id="70939" /> <Node id="70940" />And after he
was received into the Mercy it belonged to seven Khalifs, and was taken
into Spain when the Faith entered there, and some say that in his wars
Charlemagne the Emperor found it and set it under the hilt of his sword,
which was called Joyeuse because of it, and from that the Franks made
a war-shout and cried _Montjoy St. Denis_.<Node id="71281" /> <Node id="71282" />And because of its virtue
and his will the Emperor made himself lord of the world.<Node id="71364" /> <Node id="71365" />After him the
world became very evil, and the Stone made for itself a place of repose
and remained therein until to-day.<Node id="71485" /> <Node id="71486" />This is the tale of the Stone of
Suleiman, but its meaning is in the mind of him who hears it.<Node id="71580" />'<Node id="71581" />

<Node id="71583" />Chloe Burnett said abruptly, 'And they use it for----'<Node id="71637" />

<Node id="71639" />The Persian smiled.<Node id="71658" /> '<Node id="71660" />They use it as they will,' he said.<Node id="71695" /> '<Node id="71697" />But there are
those who know it by its name which I have told you.<Node id="71763" />'<Node id="71764" />

<Node id="71766" />'<Node id="71767" />But can the end of desire be an evil?<Node id="71804" />' <Node id="71806" />Chloe said.<Node id="71817" />

<Node id="71819" />'<Node id="71820" />If the End is reached too violently it may mean chaos and madness,'
Ibrahim told her.<Node id="71905" /> '<Node id="71907" />Even in lesser things it is not everyone who can bear
to be carried hither and thither, in time or place or thought, and so in
the greater it is necessary to grow accustomed to the Repose of the End.<Node id="72106" />
<Node id="72107" />I think if you were to set it on your head now and offer your soul to
it, the strength of your nature would be overthrown and not transformed
by its own strength, and you would be destroyed.<Node id="72297" /> <Node id="72298" />There is measure and
degree in all things, even upon the Way.<Node id="72359" />'<Node id="72360" />

<Node id="72362" />'<Node id="72363" />The Way?<Node id="72371" />' <Node id="72373" />Chloe asked.<Node id="72385" />

<Node id="72387" />'<Node id="72388" />The Way to the Stone, which is in the Stone,' the old man said.<Node id="72451" /> '<Node id="72453" />Yet
you have a hint of the holy letters on your forehead, and Allah shall
bring you to the Resignation.<Node id="72556" /> <Node id="72557" />For you are of Islam at heart.<Node id="72587" />'<Node id="72588" />

<Node id="72590" />'<Node id="72591" />I--of Islam?<Node id="72603" />' <Node id="72605" />Chloe cried.<Node id="72617" /> '<Node id="72619" />Do you mean a Muhammedan?<Node id="72644" />'<Node id="72645" />

<Node id="72647" />'<Node id="72648" />There is no God but God and Muhammed is the Prophet of God,' the old
man intoned gravely.<Node id="72737" /> '<Node id="72739" />Yet the Resignation is within.<Node id="72769" /> <Node id="72770" />Say what you will
of this to your master, but bid him if he is a wise judge assist us in
the restoration of the Stone.<Node id="72888" />'<Node id="72889" />

<Node id="72891" />'<Node id="72892" />But if Sir Giles bought it----' Chloe began.<Node id="72936" />

<Node id="72938" />'<Node id="72939" />He that sold it and he that bought it alike sinned,' the Hajji
answered.<Node id="73011" /> '<Node id="73013" />Tell your lord that at any time I will come to him to speak
of it if he will.<Node id="73090" /> <Node id="73091" />For I do not wish my nephew to let war loose on the
world.<Node id="73149" />'<Node id="73150" />

<Node id="73152" />'<Node id="73153" />War?<Node id="73157" />' <Node id="73159" />Chloe exclaimed.<Node id="73175" />

<Node id="73177" />'<Node id="73178" />It is the least of the plagues, perhaps,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="73233" /> '<Node id="73235" />But tell your
master and bid him think what he will do.<Node id="73290" />'<Node id="73291" />

<Node id="73293" />Gravely he took his leave, with a murmured benediction, and left Chloe
in a state of entire upheaval to await Lord Arglay's return.<Node id="73424" />

<Node id="73426" />When he came she saw that he was himself perplexed and troubled.<Node id="73490" /> <Node id="73491" />But
with the exception of asking whether she had had a visitor he said
nothing, either of information or inquiry, until after lunch.<Node id="73623" /> <Node id="73624" />When they
were back in his study he gave her cigarettes and sat down opposite her.<Node id="73706" />
'<Node id="73708" />And now,' he said; 'let's talk.<Node id="73739" /> <Node id="73740" />No--stop--let us have ...<Node id="73765" /> <Node id="73766" />what Giles
left with us here too.<Node id="73799" />' <Node id="73801" />He went for the Stone and set it, rather
seriously, on the table by them.<Node id="73874" /> '<Node id="73876" />Now for your visitor,' he said.<Node id="73907" />

<Node id="73909" />Chloe went over the conversation as far as she could.<Node id="73962" /> <Node id="73963" />When she had
finished----<Node id="73988" />

<Node id="73990" />'<Node id="73991" />You didn't tell him about the division of the Stone?<Node id="74043" />' <Node id="74045" />Lord Arglay
asked.<Node id="74063" />

<Node id="74065" />'<Node id="74066" />I didn't tell him anything at all,' Chloe said.<Node id="74113" /> '<Node id="74115" />I didn't have the
chance.<Node id="74140" /> <Node id="74141" />He did all the talking.<Node id="74164" />'<Node id="74165" />

<Node id="74167" />'<Node id="74168" />Well, that was the idea, after all.<Node id="74203" /> <Node id="74204" />I did exactly the same, only less
tactfully,' Arglay assured her.<Node id="74269" /> '<Node id="74271" />Bruce Cumberland was in the extreme
jumps, all nicely hidden of course, but there without a doubt.<Node id="74369" /> <Node id="74370" />He was
so sorry--not at all--yes, but he was, only I was the only respectable
person in touch with Sir Giles.<Node id="74479" /> <Node id="74480" />And they wanted, they very much
wanted--well, in short they wanted to know what Sir Giles had been
up to.<Node id="74585" /> <Node id="74586" />Yesterday, it appears, at some conference on the finances of
Baluchistan or the reform of the gendarmerie in the suburbs of Erzerum,
the Persian Ambassador whispered in Birlesmere's ear--he's the Foreign
Secretary, you know.<Node id="74810" /> <Node id="74811" />There was a matter of a relic, feloniously
abstracted, under cover of a payment which was really a bribe, by one
of our nationals.<Node id="74941" /> <Node id="74942" />The Ambassador himself had no use for it, nor, he
thought, had Riza Khan--but the populace, the fanatical Muhammedan
populace ...<Node id="75071" /> <Node id="75072" />his lordship the Secretary would understand.<Node id="75116" /> <Node id="75117" />Well,
Birlesmere's used to these unofficial hints, only it seems for the last
month things _have_ been a bit more restive than usual all over the Near
East, in expanding circles.<Node id="75295" /> <Node id="75296" />So he began to sit up.<Node id="75318" /> <Node id="75319" />Could his Excellency
tell him at all...<Node id="75358" />? <Node id="75360" />His Excellency, _most_ unofficially, had heard
rumours of Suleiman, and a crown, and even--without any sort of
accusation--of Sir Giles Tumulty.<Node id="75504" /> <Node id="75505" />He didn't press, he didn't even ask,
for anything; he only remarked that rumours were about.<Node id="75597" /> <Node id="75598" />Pure friendship.<Node id="75614" />
<Node id="75615" />Of course if his Britannic Majesty's Government could reassure him, just
in case the Imams (or whatever) went to Riza Khan.<Node id="75738" /> <Node id="75739" />There was even a
young fellow at the Embassy inclined to make trouble; he would be
exchanged certainly--Moscow perhaps.<Node id="75858" /> <Node id="75859" />Still....<Node id="75868" /> <Node id="75869" />Birlesmere was pushed; he
had to go off to Sandringham last night, so he switched Cumberland
on to it.<Node id="75971" /> <Node id="75972" />Who did me the honour to remember that I was Sir Giles's
brother-in-law, and begged me to sound him.<Node id="76072" /> <Node id="76073" />Had I heard?<Node id="76085" /> <Node id="76086" />Could I think?<Node id="76100" />
<Node id="76101" />Would I investigate--delicately?<Node id="76133" /> <Node id="76134" />I promised I would, told him nothing,
and came away.<Node id="76186" /> <Node id="76187" />So there we are.<Node id="76203" />'<Node id="76204" />

<Node id="76206" />They sat and looked at each other.<Node id="76240" /> <Node id="76241" />Then Lord Arglay said, 'I can only
think of one thing to be done at once, and that's to stop Reginald.<Node id="76343" /> <Node id="76344" />He
won't want to run risks with the Government, at least I shouldn't think
so, though he's thinking in millions.<Node id="76456" /> <Node id="76457" />But he _must_ keep quiet anyhow
till I can see Giles again.<Node id="76516" /> <Node id="76517" />City five seven three eight,' he added into
the telephone.<Node id="76575" />

<Node id="76577" />'<Node id="76578" />You'll see Sir Giles when he comes back?<Node id="76618" />' <Node id="76620" />Chloe asked.<Node id="76632" />

<Node id="76634" />'<Node id="76635" />I shall see _everybody_,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="76678" /> '<Node id="76680" />Giles and the Ambassador
and your Hajji and Cumberland again and so on.<Node id="76751" /> <Node id="76752" />If I'm in the centre of
it I'm going to enjoy it.<Node id="76801" /> <Node id="76802" />Is that Mr. Montague's?<Node id="76825" /> <Node id="76826" />Is Mr. Montague in?<Node id="76845" />...
<Node id="76849" />Lord Arglay....<Node id="76864" /> <Node id="76865" />That you, Reginald?<Node id="76884" />... <Node id="76888" />Look here, I've just been in
touch with the Foreign Office and I'm rather anxious about you.<Node id="76980" /> <Node id="76981" />It's
most important you should do and say nothing, absolutely _nothing_,
about the Stone at present.<Node id="77081" /> <Node id="77082" />You've got one, haven't you?<Node id="77110" /> <Node id="77111" />Sir Giles left
one with you?<Node id="77139" />... <Node id="77143" />Yes--well you mustn't even _look_ at it yet.<Node id="77187" /> <Node id="77188" />I'll tell
you ...<Node id="77205" /> <Node id="77206" />what?<Node id="77211" />'<Node id="77212" />

<Node id="77214" />Chloe watched anxiously.<Node id="77238" /> <Node id="77239" />In a minute, 'O my dear God in heaven!<Node id="77277" />' <Node id="77279" />Lord
Arglay said.<Node id="77296" /> '<Node id="77298" />No ...<Node id="77304" /> <Node id="77305" />O yes, keep it quiet _now_....<Node id="77335" /> <Node id="77336" />Who is Angus M.
Sheldrake?<Node id="77362" />... <Node id="77366" />yes, _who_?<Node id="77377" /> <Node id="77378" />Who?<Node id="77382" /> _<Node id="77384" />I_ don't know his name....<Node id="77410" /> <Node id="77411" />Oh.<Node id="77414" /> <Node id="77415" />Can we
get at him?<Node id="77433" />... <Node id="77437" />No, I don't think you'd better; perhaps I will....<Node id="77487" />
<Node id="77488" />Good-bye.<Node id="77497" />'<Node id="77498" />

<Node id="77500" />He looked round.<Node id="77516" /> '<Node id="77518" />Reginald has sold a Stone to a fellow who has made
a fortune in gallipots and other pottery ware and is called Angus M.
Sheldrake.<Node id="77648" /> <Node id="77649" />He is an American and may have left London by now.<Node id="77699" />'<Node id="77700" />

<Node id="77702" />'<Node id="77703" />But,' Chloe cried, 'do you mean he's sold his one Stone already?<Node id="77767" />'<Node id="77768" />

<Node id="77770" />'<Node id="77771" />No,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="77793" /> '<Node id="77795" />He has divided it and sold the new one.<Node id="77834" />'<Node id="77835" />

<Node id="77837" />'<Node id="77838" />But he was going to have it set!<Node id="77870" />' <Node id="77872" />Chloe said.<Node id="77883" />

<Node id="77885" />'<Node id="77886" />But he had a chance of meeting Angus M. Sheldrake, who is the richest
man that ever motored across Idaho, and as Angus was leaving London
Reginald scrapped the setting, took an hour to convince him, and did it.<Node id="78096" />
<Node id="78097" />While Bruce Cumberland was talking to me about the necessity of caution.<Node id="78169" />
<Node id="78170" />Caution!<Node id="78178" /> <Node id="78179" />With Reginald being creative.<Node id="78208" /> <Node id="78209" />Do you know I entirely forgot he
could do that?<Node id="78256" /> <Node id="78257" />Ring up the Savoy and see if the unmentionable Sheldrake
is still there.<Node id="78329" />'<Node id="78330" />

<Node id="78332" />Chloe leapt to the telephone.<Node id="78361" /> <Node id="78362" />After a few minutes--'He's left London
till Monday,' she said.<Node id="78424" />

<Node id="78426" />'<Node id="78427" />And to-day's Friday,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="78466" /> '<Node id="78468" />I wish I had Reginald in the
dock on an embezzlement charge.<Node id="78528" /> <Node id="78529" />Well--I don't want to see the Ambassador
till I've seen Giles; not after this morning.<Node id="78615" /> <Node id="78616" />You know I'm terrified in
case he _does_ start multiplying--either he or Reginald.<Node id="78698" /> <Node id="78699" />But I can't
bring him back quicker; if I try he'll just stop away.<Node id="78765" /> <Node id="78766" />I really don't
see what else we can do--till Monday.<Node id="78818" /> <Node id="78819" />I can talk to Reginald of course,
and I will.<Node id="78864" />'<Node id="78865" />

<Node id="78867" />'<Node id="78868" />Do you believe in it?<Node id="78889" />' <Node id="78891" />Chloe asked.<Node id="78903" />

<Node id="78905" />'<Node id="78906" />In the Stone?<Node id="78919" />' <Node id="78921" />Arglay said.<Node id="78933" /> '<Node id="78935" />I suppose I do--in a sense.<Node id="78962" /> <Node id="78963" />I don't know
what your friend means by calling it the end of desire.<Node id="79031" />'<Node id="79032" />

<Node id="79034" />'<Node id="79035" />What do you think he meant by saying that the way to the Stone was in
the Stone?<Node id="79115" />' <Node id="79117" />Chloe asked again.<Node id="79135" /> '<Node id="79137" />And what is the way?<Node id="79157" />'<Node id="79158" />

<Node id="79160" />'<Node id="79161" />I do not know what he meant,' Arglay answered, 'though certainly the
way to any end is in that end itself.<Node id="79267" /> <Node id="79268" />For as you cannot know any study
but by learning it, or gain any virtue but by practising it, so you
cannot be anything but by becoming it.<Node id="79407" /> <Node id="79408" />And that sounds obvious enough,
doesn't it?<Node id="79451" /> <Node id="79452" />And yet,' he went on as if to himself, 'by becoming one
thing a man ceases to be that which he was, and no one but he can tell
how tragic that change may be.<Node id="79609" /> <Node id="79610" />What do you want to be, Chloe?<Node id="79640" />'<Node id="79641" />

<Node id="79643" />The use of her name was natural enough to pass outwardly unheeded, if
not unnoticed by some small function of her mind which made a sudden
movement of affection towards him.<Node id="79816" />

<Node id="79818" />'<Node id="79819" />I do not know,' she said.<Node id="79844" />

<Node id="79846" />'<Node id="79847" />Nor I,' he said, 'for myself any more than for you.<Node id="79898" /> <Node id="79899" />I am what I am, but
it is not enough.<Node id="79936" />'<Node id="79937" />

<Node id="79939" />'<Node id="79940" />You--the Chief Justice,' she said.<Node id="79974" />

<Node id="79976" />'<Node id="79977" />I am the Chief Justice,' he answered, 'but the way is in the end, and
how far have I become justice?<Node id="80077" /> <Node id="80078" />Still'--he recovered lightness and
pointed to the typescript of _Organic Law_--'still we do what we can.<Node id="80182" />
<Node id="80183" />Well----Look here now, you can't do anything till Monday.<Node id="80240" /> <Node id="80241" />If there are
any developments I will let you know.<Node id="80291" />'<Node id="80292" />

<Node id="80294" />'<Node id="80295" />Are you sure I can't do anything?<Node id="80328" />' <Node id="80330" />she said doubtfully.<Node id="80350" />

<Node id="80352" />'<Node id="80353" />Neither of us can,' Arglay answered.<Node id="80389" /> '<Node id="80391" />You may as well clear off now.<Node id="80421" />
<Node id="80422" />Would you like to use the Stone to go home by?<Node id="80468" />'<Node id="80469" />

<Node id="80471" />'<Node id="80472" />No, thank you,' she said.<Node id="80497" /> '<Node id="80499" />I think I'm afraid of the Stone.<Node id="80531" />'<Node id="80532" />

<Node id="80534" />'<Node id="80535" />Don't think of it more than you can help between now and Monday,'
Arglay advised her.<Node id="80620" /> '<Node id="80622" />Go to the theatre to-night if you can.<Node id="80660" /> <Node id="80661" />If anything
happens messenger boys in a procession such as preceded the queen of
Sheba when _she_ came to Suleiman shall be poured out to tell you all.<Node id="80812" />'<Node id="80813" />

<Node id="80815" />'<Node id="80816" />I _was_ going to the theatre,' she said, 'but I thought of postponing
it.<Node id="80889" />'<Node id="80890" />

<Node id="80892" />'<Node id="80893" />Nonsense,' said the Chief Justice.<Node id="80927" /> '<Node id="80929" />Come on Monday and we'll tackle Sir
Giles and the Ambassador and Angus M. Sheldrake and Reginald and the
Hajji and Bruce Cumberland--and if there are any more we will deal with
them also.<Node id="81116" /> <Node id="81117" />Run along.<Node id="81127" />'<Node id="81128" />

<Node id="81130" />By midnight however Chloe almost wished she had not followed Lord
Arglay's advice.<Node id="81212" /> <Node id="81213" />For she was conscious that the evening had not been a
success, and that the young man who accompanied her was conscious of it
too.<Node id="81343" /> <Node id="81344" />This annoyed her, for in matters of pleasure she had a high sense
of duty, and not to cause gaiety appeared to her as a failure in morals.<Node id="81482" />
<Node id="81483" />Besides, Frank Lindsay was working very hard--for some examination in
surveying and estate agency--working in an office all day and then at
home in the evening, and he ought to be made as happy as possible.<Node id="81689" /> <Node id="81690" />But
all her efforts and permissions and responses had been vain; she had
said good night to her companion with an irritable sense of futility
which she just prevented herself expressing.<Node id="81876" /> <Node id="81877" />He had, as a matter of
fact, been vainly contending all the evening, without knowing it,
against two preoccupations in Chloe's mind--the Stone and Lord Arglay.<Node id="82036" />
<Node id="82037" />Not only did the Stone lie there, a palpitating centre of wonder and
terror, but against the striving endeavour of Frank Lindsay's rather
pathetic culture moved the assured placidity of Lord Arglay's.<Node id="82237" /> <Node id="82238" />It did
not make Frank less delightful in the exchanges discoverable by him and
her together, but it threw into high relief the insufficiency of those
exchanges as more than an occupation and a means of oblivion; it managed
to spoil them while providing no substitute and no answer for the
desires that thrilled her.<Node id="82553" />

<Node id="82555" />It seemed to her that all things did just so much and no more.<Node id="82617" /> <Node id="82618" />As, lying
awake that night, she reviewed her activities and preoccupations, there
appeared nothing that consumed more than a little part of her being, or
brought her, by physical excitement or mental concentration, more than
forgetfulness.<Node id="82857" /> <Node id="82858" />Nothing justified her existence.<Node id="82890" /> <Node id="82891" />The immortal sadness
of youth possessed her, and a sorrow of which youth is not always
conscious, the lucid knowledge of her unsatisfied desires.<Node id="83036" /> <Node id="83037" />There was
nothing, she thought, that could be trusted; the dearest delight might
betray, the gayest friendship open upon a treachery and a martyrdom.<Node id="83186" />
<Node id="83187" />Of her friends, of her young male friends especially, pleasant as they
were, there was not one, she thought, who held that friendship important
for her sake rather than for his own enjoyment.<Node id="83378" /> <Node id="83379" />Even that again was but
her own selfishness; what right had she to the devotion of any other?<Node id="83472" />
<Node id="83473" />And was there any devotion beyond the sudden overwhelming madness of
sex?<Node id="83546" /> <Node id="83547" />And in that hot airless tunnel of emotion what pleasure was there
and what joy?<Node id="83626" /> <Node id="83627" />Laughter died there, and lucidity, and the clear
intelligence she loved, and there was nothing of the peace for which she
hungered.<Node id="83758" />

<Node id="83760" />Her thought went off at a tangent to Reginald Montague's preoccupation
with the Stone.<Node id="83846" /> <Node id="83847" />If there could be an end to desire, was it thus that
it should be used?<Node id="83918" /> <Node id="83919" />Was it only that men might hurry the more and hurl
themselves about as if the speed of Chloe Burnett or Reginald Montague
were of moment to the universe?<Node id="84072" /> <Node id="84073" />She hated Montague, she hated Sir Giles,
she hated Frank Lindsay--poor dear!<Node id="84149" />--<Node id="84151" />she hated--no, she did not hate
Lord Arglay, but she hated the old man who had come to her and talked
of kings and prophets and heroes till she was dizzy with happiness and
dread.<Node id="84330" /> <Node id="84331" />Most of all she hated herself.<Node id="84361" /> <Node id="84362" />The dark mystery of being that
possessed her held no promise of light, but she turned to it and sank
into it, content so to avoid the world.<Node id="84502" />




<Node id="84507" />CHAPTER IV<Node id="84517" />

<Node id="84519" />VISION IN THE STONE<Node id="84538" />


<Node id="84541" />Lord Arglay spent some part of the same evening in trying to define
the process of his thought on organic law and a still larger part in
contemplation of the Stone in his possession.<Node id="84723" /> <Node id="84724" />The phrase that had most
struck him in Chloe's account of her conversation with Hajji Ibrahim was
not, as with her, 'the Way to the Stone which is in the Stone,' but
the more definite 'movement in time and place and thought.<Node id="84948" />' <Node id="84950" />The same
question that had struck Sir Giles inevitably occurred to him; if in
place, then why not in time?<Node id="85056" /> <Node id="85057" />He wondered whether Sir Giles and Palliser,
whoever Palliser might be, were making experiments with it that very
evening at Birmingham.<Node id="85192" /> <Node id="85193" />The difficulty, he thought, was absurdly simple,
and consisted merely in the fact of the Stone itself.<Node id="85295" /> <Node id="85296" />Supposing you
willed to return a year, and to be again in those exact conditions,
interior and exterior, in which you had been a year ago--why then,
either you would have the Stone with you or you would not.<Node id="85503" /> <Node id="85504" />If you had,
you were not the same: if you had not, then how did you return, short
of living through the intervening period all over again?<Node id="85642" /> <Node id="85643" />Lord Arglay
shuddered at the possibility.<Node id="85684" /> <Node id="85685" />It would be delightful, he thought, to
know again the thrill which had gone through him when he had heard of
his appointment to the office he held.<Node id="85832" /> <Node id="85833" />But to have to go again through
all those years of painful appeals, difficult judgements, distressing
decisions, which so often meant unhappiness to the innocent--no.<Node id="85999" />
<Node id="86000" />Besides--supposing you did.<Node id="86027" /> <Node id="86028" />When you reached again this moment you would
again return by virtue of the Stone--and so for ever.<Node id="86126" /> <Node id="86127" />An infinite series
of repetitions of those same few years, a being compelled to grow no
older, a consciousness forbidden to expand or to die.<Node id="86268" /> <Node id="86269" />So far as Lord
Arglay could see five minutes' return would be fatal; if, now, he willed
himself back at the beginning of his meditations necessity would keep
him thinking precisely those thoughts through an everlasting sequence.<Node id="86497" />
<Node id="86498" />For if you willed yourself back you willed yourself precisely to be
without the Stone; otherwise you were not back in the past as the past
had truly been.<Node id="86652" /> <Node id="86653" />And Lord Arglay had a suspicion that the Stone would be
purely logical.<Node id="86724" />

<Node id="86726" />Yes, he thought, but what, in that sense, were the rules of its pure
logic?<Node id="86801" /> <Node id="86802" />How could you exist in that past _again_ except by virtue of the
Stone?<Node id="86873" /> <Node id="86874" />if that were not there you yourself could not be there.<Node id="86929" /> <Node id="86930" />The thing
was a contradiction in terms; you could not be in the past without the
Stone yet with the Stone you could not be in the past.<Node id="87065" /> <Node id="87066" />Then the Stone
could not act in time.<Node id="87103" /> <Node id="87104" />But Chloe's visitor had said it could.<Node id="87142" /> <Node id="87143" />And a
Stone that could create itself out of itself and could deal as it had
dealt with space ought to be able to deal in some way or other with
time.<Node id="87292" /> <Node id="87293" />For time was the same thing as space, or rather duration was a
method of extension--that was elementary.<Node id="87397" /> '<Node id="87399" />Extension,' he thought, 'I
extend myself into--into what?<Node id="87456" /> <Node id="87457" />Nothingness; the past is not; it doesn't
exist.<Node id="87504" />' <Node id="87506" />He shook his head; so simple a solution had never appealed to
him.<Node id="87572" /> <Node id="87573" />Every infinitesimal fraction of a second the whole universe peeled
off, so to speak, and passed out of consciousness, except for the
extremely blurred pictures of memory, whatever memory might be.<Node id="87769" /> <Node id="87770" />Out
of existence?<Node id="87787" /> <Node id="87788" />that was his difficulty; was it out of existence?<Node id="87837" /> <Node id="87838" />He
remembered having read somewhere once a fantastic theory that whenever a
man made a choice, a real choice--whenever he definitely did one of two
things he also did at the same moment the other and brought an entire
new universe into being that he might do so.<Node id="88100" /> <Node id="88101" />For otherwise an infinite
number of potentialities would exist for ever unfulfilled--which, the
writer had said, though Lord Arglay had forgotten his reasons, was
absurd.<Node id="88271" /> <Node id="88272" />It had occasionally consoled him, or at least had appeared to
him as a not disagreeable hope, when the Court had rejected an appeal
from a sentence of death, to think that at the same time, in a new
universe parting from this one as the Stone before him had parted from
its original, they had allowed it.<Node id="88576" /> <Node id="88577" />In which case a number of Christopher
Arglays must exist; the thought almost reduced him to idiocy.<Node id="88676" /> <Node id="88677" />But in the
same way the past might, even materially, exist; only man was not
aware of it, time being, whatever else it was, a necessity of his
consciousness.<Node id="88834" /> '<Node id="88836" />But because I can only be sequentially conscious,' he
argued, 'must I hold that what is not communicated to consciousness
does not exist?<Node id="88973" /> <Node id="88974" />I think in a line--but there is the potentiality of the
plane.<Node id="89036" />' <Node id="89038" />This perhaps was what great art was--a momentary apprehension
of the plane at a point in the line.<Node id="89136" /> <Node id="89137" />The Demeter of Cnidos, the Praying
Hands of D�rer, the _Ode to a Nightingale_, the Ninth Symphony--the
sense of vastness in those small things was the vastness of all that
had been felt in the present.<Node id="89338" /> <Node id="89339" />Would one dare wish to _be_ the Demeter?<Node id="89379" />
<Node id="89380" />to be--what?<Node id="89392" /> <Node id="89393" />Stone?<Node id="89399" /> <Node id="89400" />yes, presumably stone.<Node id="89422" /> <Node id="89423" />But stone of an intense
significance--to others; but to itself?<Node id="89486" /> <Node id="89487" />Agnosticism checked him; no one
knew.<Node id="89524" /> <Node id="89525" />No one knew whether the Demeter had consciousness, or if so of
what kind.<Node id="89598" /> <Node id="89599" />Lord Arglay abandoned art and returned to the question of
time.<Node id="89662" />

<Node id="89664" />Frankly he was not going to risk perpetual recurrence.<Node id="89718" /> <Node id="89719" />He had no
intention--his mind chilled suddenly within him as he thought of Giles
Tumulty.<Node id="89808" /> <Node id="89809" />Would that insane scientist mind risking recurrence--for
someone else?<Node id="89879" /> <Node id="89880" />If he could find someone who didn't see the catch, he
would risk it quite happily, the Chief Justice thought, and stood up
in agitation.<Node id="90016" /> <Node id="90017" />Some wretched laboratory assistant, some curator, some
charwoman even, anyone who would put that bit of gold on their heads
and try to will themselves back ten minutes.<Node id="90185" /> <Node id="90186" />If his own thought was
right ...<Node id="90218" /> <Node id="90219" />Giles would watch the fellow thinking, doing, being, the same
thing for ever.<Node id="90296" /> <Node id="90297" />But no--that would involve Sir Giles being there to give
him, whoever it might be, the Stone.<Node id="90390" /> <Node id="90391" />Only a past Giles though, not the
present.<Node id="90433" /> <Node id="90434" />The Giles whom the victim knew--there needn't be a real Giles
at all.<Node id="90503" /> <Node id="90504" />But then the victim would just disappear--he wouldn't be there
at all.<Node id="90574" /> <Node id="90575" />Well, Giles, he knew, would sacrifice anyone in creation just to
prove that.<Node id="90651" /> <Node id="90652" />And would look, with a grin of pleasure, at the placards
announcing a sensational disappearance.<Node id="90748" /> <Node id="90749" />In the horror of approaching
a conception of real hell Lord Arglay for the first time since his
childhood found himself almost believing in God from sheer fright.<Node id="90911" />

<Node id="90913" />He walked about the room.<Node id="90938" /> <Node id="90939" />He had meant to try and think out the future
but this agony was too much for him.<Node id="91020" /> <Node id="91021" />Who was the Palliser Giles was
working with?<Node id="91065" /> <Node id="91066" />He flung himself at such works of reference as he
possessed--a _Whitaker_, a _Who's Who_--and found him.<Node id="91170" /> <Node id="91171" />Abel Timothy
Palliser, Professor of Relative Psychology at the University of
Birmingham, born 1872, educated--and so on, unmarried.<Node id="91302" /> <Node id="91303" />Career--and
so on.<Node id="91321" /> <Node id="91322" />Author of _Studies in Hypnotic Consciousness_; _The Mind as a
Function of Approach_; _The Discontinuous Integer_.<Node id="91435" /> <Node id="91436" />The titles, in his
present state, seemed to Lord Arglay merely sinister.<Node id="91508" /> <Node id="91509" />He had a moment's
vision of two men playing with victim after victim.<Node id="91578" /> <Node id="91579" />Well, they wouldn't
succeed with him--they didn't know of Sheldrake--they might trick
Reginald, and though Reginald was a besotted idiot, still even
Reginald--'Ass,' Lord Arglay said, 'they're in Birmingham,' and
immediately went on, 'How do I know they're in Birmingham?<Node id="91850" /> <Node id="91851" />They may have
taken a late train--but they needn't take a train!<Node id="91915" /> <Node id="91916" />Fool that I am, this
thrice infernal Stone will do it for them!<Node id="91979" /> <Node id="91980" />O damn the day when that
accursed Giles----'<Node id="92024" />

<Node id="92026" />In the middle of the imprecation he stopped and made himself sit down.<Node id="92096" />
<Node id="92097" />A small voice within him said 'Something must be done about this.<Node id="92162" />' <Node id="92164" />After
all, he might be wrong; the Stone might act, in time, in ways he could
not foresee.<Node id="92253" /> <Node id="92254" />Or Chloe might have got Hajji Ibrahim's words wrong.<Node id="92306" /> <Node id="92307" />His
first impulse was to go to Sir Giles and stop whatever devilry might be
taking place.<Node id="92396" /> <Node id="92397" />But, short of violence, it would be difficult to stop
Tumulty doing whatever he wanted.<Node id="92484" /> <Node id="92485" />An alternative was to find out, if he
could, exactly what the powers of the Stone were, and the only person
who could tell him that, so far as he could see, was Hajji Ibrahim.<Node id="92660" /> <Node id="92661" />At
the moment, Lord Arglay realized, he himself was the passive centre of
the whole affair; the Government, the Embassy, Sir Giles, Reginald, all
their activities were communicated to him.<Node id="92849" /> <Node id="92850" />It might be possible to lay
Sir Giles out; on the other hand, Giles was an awkward enemy and might
lay him out, and then the confusion would, he thought more or less
impartially, be worse.<Node id="93038" /> <Node id="93039" />It looked like the Embassy first, and in
something under five minutes he was speaking to Hajji Ibrahim on the
telephone.<Node id="93159" />

<Node id="93161" />'<Node id="93162" />I am Lord Arglay,' he said.<Node id="93189" /> '<Node id="93191" />I wonder, Hajji, if you could spare me ten
minutes.<Node id="93242" />'<Node id="93243" />

<Node id="93245" />'<Node id="93246" />I will come at once,' the answer reached him.<Node id="93291" /> '<Node id="93293" />You are willing to help
us, yes?<Node id="93325" />'<Node id="93326" />

<Node id="93328" />'<Node id="93329" />I am willing to talk to you,' the Chief Justice answered.<Node id="93386" /> '<Node id="93388" />You will be
round here immediately?<Node id="93423" /> <Node id="93424" />Good.<Node id="93429" />'<Node id="93430" />

<Node id="93432" />It took him, however, when the Hajji arrived, more than ten minutes to
reach tactfully the two questions he was anxious to have answered.<Node id="93569" /> <Node id="93570" />What
_was_ the Stone?<Node id="93591" /> <Node id="93592" />and what could it do?<Node id="93613" />

<Node id="93615" />'<Node id="93616" />What is it in itself, I mean?<Node id="93645" />' <Node id="93647" />he urged.<Node id="93656" /> '<Node id="93658" />Yes, Miss Burnett told me its
history--but what is it?<Node id="93712" /> <Node id="93713" />Is it a new element?<Node id="93733" />'<Node id="93734" />

<Node id="93736" />'<Node id="93737" />I think it is the First Matter,' the Hajji told him, 'from which all
things are made--spirits and material things.<Node id="93851" />'<Node id="93852" />

<Node id="93854" />'<Node id="93855" />Spirits?<Node id="93863" />' <Node id="93865" />Arglay said.<Node id="93877" /> '<Node id="93879" />But this is matter;' he pressed a finger on the
Stone.<Node id="93933" />

<Node id="93935" />'<Node id="93936" />Matter to matter,' Ibrahim answered, 'but perhaps mind to mind, and
soul to soul.<Node id="94017" /> <Node id="94018" />That is why it will do anything you ask it--with all your
heart.<Node id="94082" /> <Node id="94083" />But you must will truly and sincerely.<Node id="94121" />'<Node id="94122" />

<Node id="94124" />'<Node id="94125" />In the matter of time,' Arglay, after a moment's meditation, went on,
'can it transfer a man from one point to another?<Node id="94244" />'<Node id="94245" />

<Node id="94247" />'<Node id="94248" />Assuredly,' the Hajji said.<Node id="94275" /> '<Node id="94277" />But you must remember that the Keepers of
the Stone have not for centuries of generations laid hands on it, far
less used it for such things.<Node id="94418" /> <Node id="94419" />It has been kept in profound seclusion,
and now that it is loose I fear greatly for the world.<Node id="94513" /> <Node id="94514" />I think this
Giles Tumulty has little reverence and few scruples.<Node id="94579" />'<Node id="94580" />

<Node id="94582" />'<Node id="94583" />So do I,' Lord Arglay said grimly.<Node id="94617" /> '<Node id="94619" />He has told you that he will
multiply it?<Node id="94660" />'<Node id="94661" />

<Node id="94663" />'<Node id="94664" />He has threatened us with the most awful and obscene sacrilege,' the
Hajji answered, trying to keep his voice calm.<Node id="94779" /> '<Node id="94781" />He has sworn that he
will divide the Indivisible for his own ends.<Node id="94847" />'<Node id="94848" />

<Node id="94850" />'<Node id="94851" />But _time_----' Arglay, returning to his point, laid the problem before
the Persian but he got no satisfaction.<Node id="94962" />

<Node id="94964" />'<Node id="94965" />I tell you since the Shah Ismail laid hands on it five hundred years
ago no one has desecrated it so,' Ibrahim insisted.<Node id="95085" /> '<Node id="95087" />For he perished
miserably with all his house.<Node id="95132" /> <Node id="95133" />How should I know in what manner the Holy
Thing permits itself to be used?<Node id="95207" /> <Node id="95208" />Give me the Stone which you have and
let us seek the other.<Node id="95267" />'<Node id="95268" />

<Node id="95270" />'<Node id="95271" />Others,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="95297" /> '<Node id="95299" />The affair's gone farther than you think,
Hajji.<Node id="95347" /> <Node id="95348" />And it won't be an easy thing to get it back from Giles without
worse trouble.<Node id="95426" />'<Node id="95427" />

<Node id="95429" />'<Node id="95430" />Cannot your Government seize it?<Node id="95462" />' <Node id="95464" />the other asked, but Arglay shook his
head.<Node id="95507" />

<Node id="95509" />'<Node id="95510" />To be perfectly frank,' he answered, 'I doubt if the Government would
go to extremes unless they realized something of its value.<Node id="95639" /> <Node id="95640" />And then--I
hope for the best--but it's no use blinking the possibility--then, if
they knew its value, they mightn't very much want to give it back.<Node id="95788" />'<Node id="95789" />

<Node id="95791" />'<Node id="95792" />Ali Khan will raise all the deserts and bazaars against them,' Ibrahim
said--'Egypt and Arabia, Africa and Syria and Iraq and Iran and India
and beyond.<Node id="95944" />'<Node id="95945" />

<Node id="95947" />'<Node id="95948" />I dare say,' Arglay answered gloomily.<Node id="95986" /> '<Node id="95988" />But Ali Khan won't have the
Stone.<Node id="96022" /> <Node id="96023" />And if it comes to raising the Government can do a little.<Node id="96081" />
<Node id="96082" />Besides, what do you suppose the other Powers would be doing--if the
whole of Islam was at war?<Node id="96177" /> <Node id="96178" />No, Hajji, I wouldn't trust the Government
so far as to tell them what it can do.<Node id="96259" />'<Node id="96260" />

<Node id="96262" />'<Node id="96263" />I know,' the Hajji answered.<Node id="96291" /> '<Node id="96293" />I did but seek for your thought.<Node id="96325" /> <Node id="96326" />I have
told Ali Khan we shall never recover it by war.<Node id="96380" />'<Node id="96381" />

<Node id="96383" />'<Node id="96384" />What is worrying _me_,' the Chief Justice went on, 'is what devil's
tricks Giles may be playing all this while and what I ought to be doing
to stop them.<Node id="96537" />'<Node id="96538" />

<Node id="96540" />'<Node id="96541" />Ask it if you will,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="96575" />

<Node id="96577" />'<Node id="96578" />Eh?<Node id="96581" />' <Node id="96583" />Lord Arglay stared.<Node id="96602" />

<Node id="96604" />'<Node id="96605" />Ask it to illuminate your mind and show you what your brother is doing
at this moment.<Node id="96691" /> <Node id="96692" />The manuscripts tell us that it moves in the world of
thought as in the world of action.<Node id="96780" /> <Node id="96781" />Only take care that you are not
snared in his thought so that your mind cannot return to itself.<Node id="96877" />'<Node id="96878" />

<Node id="96880" />'<Node id="96881" />If it can do all this,' Arglay said, 'cannot it reunite itself and
return of its own virtue, if you will it so?<Node id="96992" />'<Node id="96993" />

<Node id="96995" />'<Node id="96996" />No,' the Hajji answered, 'for it will do nothing for itself of itself,
neither divide nor reunite.<Node id="97094" /> <Node id="97095" />One Stone has no power upon its Type unless
they are under the will of a single mind.<Node id="97180" /> <Node id="97181" />Unless indeed----' He paused.<Node id="97210" />

<Node id="97212" />'<Node id="97213" />Unless----?<Node id="97224" />' <Node id="97226" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="97244" />

<Node id="97246" />'<Node id="97247" />Unless anyone should will that it and he should be with the
Transcendence,' Ibrahim said in a very low voice.<Node id="97356" /> '<Node id="97358" />But I do not know who
would dare that; and if he presumed and failed he would be destroyed and
the Stone he held would be left in the world where he failed.<Node id="97514" /> <Node id="97515" />For the
Stone is he, and will go where he goes and no farther.<Node id="97577" /> <Node id="97578" />But if he came
to the End ...<Node id="97607" /> <Node id="97608" />I do not know; these are very terrible things.<Node id="97654" />'<Node id="97655" />

<Node id="97657" />'<Node id="97658" />And can none of the house of the Keepers,' the Chief Justice asked,
'dare to will this thing to save the Stone from its enemies?<Node id="97786" />'<Node id="97787" />

<Node id="97789" />'<Node id="97790" />I have asked that,' Ibrahim answered, 'but we know too little and too
much.<Node id="97865" /> <Node id="97866" />We know we are not worthy, and we do not know what is its will.<Node id="97929" />
<Node id="97930" />Ali Khan desires to redeem the Stone for the sake of his Faith and I for
the honour of my house, and my brothers in Persia for their glory or
their peace, but we dare not bring these things into the Transcendence.<Node id="98143" />'<Node id="98144" />

<Node id="98146" />Lord Arglay was silent again.<Node id="98175" /> <Node id="98176" />His mind told him the Persian's meaning
but his being did not respond to it.<Node id="98252" /> <Node id="98253" />Long since he had left these
questions aside, unless--as in rare moments he sometimes fantastically
hoped--the nature of law was also the nature of God.<Node id="98405" /> <Node id="98406" />But if so it was
not in the Transcendence but in the order of created things.<Node id="98483" /> <Node id="98484" />In a minute
or two he brought the talk back to the immediate necessities.<Node id="98557" />

<Node id="98559" />'<Node id="98560" />Do you tell me,' he said, 'that I can know what Giles is doing or
purposing?<Node id="98636" />'<Node id="98637" />

<Node id="98639" />'<Node id="98640" />The Traditions say so,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="98681" /> '<Node id="98683" />But it is a perilous thing
to undertake; for you must sink into the life of thought and you may not
easily return.<Node id="98797" />'<Node id="98798" />

<Node id="98800" />'<Node id="98801" />I am a worm and no man,' Lord Arglay said, 'but if Giles can catch _me_
in his mental perversities----'<Node id="98904" />

<Node id="98906" />'<Node id="98907" />Take care,' the Hajji interrupted him.<Node id="98945" /> '<Node id="98947" />I think it is not your strength
that shall save you.<Node id="98999" />'<Node id="99000" />

<Node id="99002" />The Chief Justice suppressed his words but he was conscious that a very
strong sense of pride was on tip-toe within him, anxious to defy Giles
and all his works.<Node id="99163" /> <Node id="99164" />He waited till it had sunk down a little, and said:
'What shall I do then?<Node id="99238" /> <Node id="99239" />For if any wretched charwoman is being trapped
to-night...<Node id="99297" />' <Node id="99299" />It was ridiculous, he thought at the same moment, how his
mind kept running on charwomen.<Node id="99388" /> <Node id="99389" />But he had a vision of some thin, rather
harassed, grey-haired female being persuaded to take the Stone and being
caught in an everlasting cleaning of some stone corridor.<Node id="99560" /> <Node id="99561" />All wrong
metaphysically, no doubt, he protested--but possible--no, not possible:
no more than sudden passage from place to place or a Stone that divided
itself and was yet unchanged.<Node id="99744" />

<Node id="99746" />Ibrahim answered, 'You need but take it into your hand and will.<Node id="99810" />'<Node id="99811" />

<Node id="99813" />'<Node id="99814" />And you?<Node id="99822" />' <Node id="99824" />Arglay said.<Node id="99836" /> '<Node id="99838" />Will you do it with me?<Node id="99861" />'<Node id="99862" />

<Node id="99864" />The Hajji hesitated.<Node id="99884" /> '<Node id="99886" />It is almost sacrilege,' he murmured, 'yet it is
with a right desire.<Node id="99955" /> <Node id="99956" />I dare not use my will, but I may sit by you while
you use your own.<Node id="100024" /> <Node id="100025" />So much is perhaps not against my oath....<Node id="100067" /> <Node id="100068" />Under the
Protection.<Node id="100089" />' <Node id="100091" />He stretched out his hand.<Node id="100117" /> '<Node id="100119" />Take the Stone and let it lay
in your palm, and I will put my hand over it, and set your desire to
know what Giles Tumulty does and purposes.<Node id="100260" />'<Node id="100261" />

<Node id="100263" />'<Node id="100264" />And for the return?<Node id="100283" />' <Node id="100285" />Arglay asked.<Node id="100298" />

<Node id="100300" />'<Node id="100301" />That is with Allah,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="100335" /> '<Node id="100337" />Will you dare it now?<Node id="100358" />'<Node id="100359" />

<Node id="100361" />For all answer the Chief Justice pulled an armchair near and parallel to
his visitor's; then he sat down in it and laid his arm on the arm of the
chair.<Node id="100513" /> <Node id="100514" />On his palm the Stone rested.<Node id="100543" /> <Node id="100544" />Ibrahim laid his own hand lightly
over it and so they remained.<Node id="100607" />

<Node id="100609" />Arglay, as he leaned back, formed in his mind, out of the impulse of
distaste which grew in it, the image of Giles Tumulty.<Node id="100732" /> <Node id="100733" />He suppressed, as
quickly as he could, the criticisms of his brother-in-law which he was
tempted to make to himself; he compelled them to define the central idea
more exactly.<Node id="100908" /> <Node id="100909" />Then he released upon that image the anxiety which had
possessed him; he made a demand of it and sent it out to compel an
answer.<Node id="101038" /> <Node id="101039" />The antipathy he always felt grew stronger but it was controlled
and directed by his intention; Giles's mind should lie open to his, he
was determined.<Node id="101190" /> <Node id="101191" />He felt, but without attending to it, Ibrahim's hand
quiver upon his, as he was still vaguely aware of the chair on which he
was sitting.<Node id="101328" /> <Node id="101329" />Slowly those details of sensation vanished, and instead he
became aware that he was holding, or seemed to be holding, a living
thing, a moving, pulsating something which he hated.<Node id="101508" /> <Node id="101509" />It was approaching
him; he drove his detestation forward to meet it.<Node id="101577" /> <Node id="101578" />The sensation of
enclosing it in his hand disappeared; physical connection ceased, and he
seemed to know as a mental experience alone.<Node id="101712" /> <Node id="101713" />Only that experience now
existed; he was repelled, yet since nothing but repulsion was to be felt
it was that which passionately concerned his whole being.<Node id="101868" /> <Node id="101869" />He allowed
that repulsion to enter him, but as his spirit seemed to retire before
it, so at the same time it overcame and dominated it.<Node id="102004" /> <Node id="102005" />There ensued a
moment's balance between those contending forces; they swung equal and
then the effort ceased.<Node id="102114" /> <Node id="102115" />His mind was aware of an ordered arrangement, as
if in the outer world it had been considering the plan of a great city;
he concentrated his attention even more strongly, and found himself
conscious of an overpowering desire.<Node id="102340" />

<Node id="102342" />But it was a consciousness purely intellectual; the normal confusion of
the mind by the emotions was absent.<Node id="102450" /> <Node id="102451" />He was not concerned to excuse,
justify, or condemn the desire he felt existing; rather he observed it
merely.<Node id="102561" /> <Node id="102562" />Nor indeed was he at first clear what he was considering, until
there shaped itself against the darkness a face, a large, youthful,
eager face which was gazing at him with a docile attention.<Node id="102753" /> <Node id="102754" />It had red
hair, a rather squab nose, a high colour, a weak mouth slightly open,
brown and expectant eyes.<Node id="102860" /> <Node id="102861" />His mind remarked that it was a face hitherto
unseen; it reported at the same time a hatred of the face, combined with
a desire to see it hurt and damaged--yet not in mere uselessness but in
the process of extracting some personal profit out of its existence and
its pain.<Node id="103133" /> <Node id="103134" />The face removed itself to a little distance and developed
into the whole figure of a young man, a lower middle-class young man,
who was speaking.<Node id="103280" /> <Node id="103281" />A small, very distant voice floated into his mind.<Node id="103331" />
'<Node id="103333" />Yes,' it was saying, 'yes, sir; and then?<Node id="103374" />' <Node id="103376" />He heard another strange
voice--an older, sharper voice--say, 'That's the whole thing; you
understand?<Node id="103478" />' <Node id="103480" />and the rest of his being underwent a sudden spasm of
delight.<Node id="103542" />

<Node id="103544" />'<Node id="103545" />Christ Almighty,' Lord Arglay thought suddenly, 'this is happening,'
and with the momentary distraction the form flickered and seemed to
fade.<Node id="103687" /> <Node id="103688" />But he made a desperate effort to hold it, and at once a strength
flowed out from him.<Node id="103774" /> <Node id="103775" />The young man's figure no longer appeared alone; it
was in a room, a long room, with windows, instruments, books, and there
was another figure by it.<Node id="103924" /> <Node id="103925" />A tall, lean, oldish man, with a sharp anxious
face, was standing there, playing with something in his hand.<Node id="104033" /> <Node id="104034" />It was one
of the Stones--no, it was the Crown itself, and with the sight his mind
realized what and where it was.<Node id="104148" /> <Node id="104149" />It was looking out, his mind, through
Giles Tumulty's eyes; it was Giles Tumulty's desire that it knew; it was
Giles Tumulty's experiment that was beginning--and Christopher Arglay's
mind that watched it.<Node id="104353" />

<Node id="104355" />But that mind was so detached that it seemed incapable of staying or
hastening the intention that flowed around it; as often as it turned
inwards to realize its own separate existence the appearances which it
beheld mingled and faded.<Node id="104589" /> <Node id="104590" />It was suspended and observant.<Node id="104621" />

<Node id="104623" />Yet, as if on the outskirts of its own nature, it presently found
itself observing other thoughts.<Node id="104721" /> <Node id="104722" />Much the same argument that Arglay had
already gone over flashed through it; scattered phrases--'if he just
disappears'--'time and place'--'I wonder what Arglay would say to
this'--struck it and passed.<Node id="104924" /> <Node id="104925" />The figure of the young man put out its
hand and received something from the tall man.<Node id="105011" /> <Node id="105012" />Lord Arglay's mind made
an effort forward.<Node id="105054" /> '<Node id="105056" />Stop, you fool,' it knew itself thinking, and heard
Giles's voice say, close and loud, 'Calm now, quite calm.<Node id="105165" /> <Node id="105166" />Just make as
near an image of what you were doing as you can.<Node id="105227" />'<Node id="105228" />

<Node id="105230" />The alien mind that received those words shuddered with the horror.<Node id="105297" /> <Node id="105298" />But
the mental habits of so many years befriended it then; it realized, as
it felt the pang, that it could do nothing then and there.<Node id="105431" /> <Node id="105432" />It must act
in its own medium; on the crowd of diabolic curiosities that surged
around it, it could produce no effect.<Node id="105550" /> '<Node id="105552" />I am here,' Lord Arglay's mind
said to itself, 'by my will and the virtue of the Stone.<Node id="105639" /> <Node id="105640" />I can do
nothing here--nothing.<Node id="105671" /> <Node id="105672" />I must return by virtue of the Stone.<Node id="105709" />' <Node id="105711" />It sought
to shut out the vision in front of it; it sought to concentrate on
itself and to will to know again the vehicle that was natural to it.<Node id="105856" /> <Node id="105857" />And
even as it did so Lord Arglay heard a voice saying to him: 'Have you
seen?<Node id="105935" /> <Node id="105936" />have you seen?<Node id="105950" />'<Node id="105951" />

<Node id="105953" />He was lying back in his own chair.<Node id="105988" /> <Node id="105989" />Beside him Hajji Ibrahim was looking
anxiously at him.<Node id="106043" /> <Node id="106044" />The Stone?<Node id="106054" /> <Node id="106055" />yes, the Stone still lay quietly enough on
his palm.<Node id="106107" /> <Node id="106108" />Lord Arglay stared at it as if his eyes would never shift.<Node id="106166" />
<Node id="106167" />Then very slowly he got to his feet and laid it carefully on the table.<Node id="106238" />
<Node id="106239" />As he did so Ibrahim repeated: 'Have you seen?<Node id="106285" />'<Node id="106286" />

<Node id="106288" />'<Node id="106289" />Yes,' Lord Arglay said, again slowly.<Node id="106326" /> '<Node id="106328" />Yes, I have seen.<Node id="106345" /> <Node id="106346" />And if what I
have seen is true, and if it is as I fear it may be, I will choke Giles
Tumulty's life out of him myself.<Node id="106465" /> <Node id="106466" />Have _you_ seen?<Node id="106482" />'<Node id="106483" />

<Node id="106485" />'<Node id="106486" />I think I slept and dreamed.<Node id="106514" /> <Node id="106515" />And in my dream----' the Hajji said, and
described the room and the two forms.<Node id="106593" /> <Node id="106594" />But he went on--'Also I saw a
little brownish man standing by a table, and his eyes were all alight
with curiosity and desire.<Node id="106720" /> <Node id="106721" />Also I saw,' and he began to tremble, 'that
they had again divided the Stone; for they did not give the Crown to
the youth, but only a Stone.<Node id="106862" /> <Node id="106863" />I think they are very evil men.<Node id="106894" />'<Node id="106895" />

<Node id="106897" />'<Node id="106898" />I believe you care more about the division of the Stone than about the
harm they may do with it,' Arglay dispassionately said.<Node id="107024" />

<Node id="107026" />'<Node id="107027" />Certainly I do,' the Hajji answered, 'for the one is an offence against
the Holy One, but the other only against man.<Node id="107144" /> <Node id="107145" />He who divides the Unity
is a greater sinner than he who makes a mock of his brother.<Node id="107230" />'<Node id="107231" />

<Node id="107233" />'<Node id="107234" />You may be right,' Lord Arglay said, 'but of the Unity I know nothing,
and of man I know something.<Node id="107333" />' <Node id="107335" />He stamped suddenly with sheer rage.<Node id="107371" /> '<Node id="107373" />Why
did I return?<Node id="107390" />' <Node id="107392" />he cried out.<Node id="107405" />

<Node id="107407" />'<Node id="107408" />You did wisely,' the Hajji said, 'for you had not gone to fight his
will but to observe it.<Node id="107499" /> <Node id="107500" />You will not find it easy, I know now, to break
Giles Tumulty's will, and you could not have done it in that way.<Node id="107613" />
<Node id="107614" />Consider that, if what you fear has happened, this young man's mind will
not perhaps suffer so much, for in the very nature of things he will not
know that he is living but that one period of past time over and over
again, until the day when the End of Desire shall come indeed; nay, for
all we know, he may be saved from many evils so.<Node id="107950" />'<Node id="107951" />

<Node id="107953" />'<Node id="107954" />He may be saved from what you will,' Lord Arglay said, and his face set
as he spoke, 'but no human being shall be turned into an automaton at
the will of Giles Tumulty while I am living and sane.<Node id="108149" />'<Node id="108150" />

<Node id="108152" />There was a short silence, then Arglay went on.<Node id="108199" /> '<Node id="108201" />But you are so far
right that we do not know what arrangements Giles has made, nor what the
end of this experiment of his may be.<Node id="108330" /> <Node id="108331" />And till we know where the Types
of the Stone all are--if that is what you call them--we must move
slowly.<Node id="108437" /> <Node id="108438" />To-morrow I will go to the Foreign Office again, and after that
we will talk with one another further.<Node id="108540" />'<Node id="108541" />

<Node id="108543" />The Hajji stood up.<Node id="108562" /> '<Node id="108564" />The Peace be upon you,' he said.<Node id="108596" />

<Node id="108598" />'<Node id="108599" />It will be a peace that passeth all understanding then,' the Chief
Justice answered, and took him to the door.<Node id="108709" />




<Node id="108714" />CHAPTER V<Node id="108723" />

<Node id="108725" />THE LOSS OF A TYPE<Node id="108743" />


<Node id="108746" />Nor was Lord Arglay any nearer to an apprehension of that mystical Peace
when he discovered on the next morning, that everybody had taken
advantage of the week-end to vanish from London.<Node id="108932" /> <Node id="108933" />Mr. Bruce Cumberland
was expected back on Monday; so was Mr. Reginald Montague; so was Mr.
Angus M. Sheldrake.<Node id="109043" /> <Node id="109044" />As for Sir Giles he might be back any moment, but so
far as he was expected at all it was on Monday.<Node id="109144" /> <Node id="109145" />The Persian Ambassador
even (not that he was wanted) had gone to Sandringham,--so _The Times_
said--where presumably he and Lord Birlesmere were being diplomatic.<Node id="109307" />
<Node id="109308" />London--to the Chief Justice's irritation--consisted of himself, the
Hajji, and Chloe, neither of whom seemed at the moment to be much good
to him.<Node id="109455" /> <Node id="109456" />He thought of confronting Sir Giles, wherever he might be,
but he was unwilling to give his brother-in-law that advantage of
circumstances which he would then undeniably possess, and at last he
resigned himself to spending a day of enmity deferred which, if it did
not make his heart sick, made it at least extremely and unusually
sullen.<Node id="109794" />

<Node id="109796" />He would not have been any happier if he had known what was happening,
on that same Saturday morning, at a country house some fifty miles out
of London, the property of Mr. Sheldrake and his occasional retreat from
high finance and the complications of industry when he was in England.<Node id="110081" />
<Node id="110082" />The Chief Justice had done him some wrong in limiting him to gallipots;
actually there were few branches of production and distribution in which
he had not, somehow or other, a share.<Node id="110265" /> <Node id="110266" />These had mostly come to him from
his father, as Rivington Court had come to him from his mother, and
Sheldrake's own additions had consisted of several large motor factories
and the establishment of an Atlantic Airways Company to the first, and
an entirely unnecessary though quite beautiful wing to the second.<Node id="110578" />
<Node id="110579" />Neither it nor the Atlantic Airways would probably have come into
existence but for Cecilia Sheldrake, who, having been forestalled in her
desire to be the first woman to fly the Atlantic, had determined that at
least most of the others who did so should do it by her permission.<Node id="110858" /> <Node id="110859" />Her
husband had founded the company, as he had built the wing, in order that
she might have everything she wanted to play with, and when he had
bought the Stone from Reginald Montague he had done it with a similar
intention in his mind.<Node id="111095" />

<Node id="111097" />In actual fact it had taken a longer time to persuade Sheldrake to buy
than Reginald had admitted to his uncle.<Node id="111208" /> <Node id="111209" />But the surprising chances of
that Friday--the coming of Sir Giles with the Stone, the meeting with
Sheldrake at an unexpected conference on the same morning, the discovery
that the richest man of Idaho, of the States, of the world (report
varied) was a young fellow not quite so old as he himself was--all these
had convinced Reginald that what, at a pinch, he would have been driven
to call Providence was on his side, and had given him an increased
audacity.<Node id="111670" /> <Node id="111671" />He had caught Sheldrake by mentioning, almost in one breath,
transport, the Lord Chief Justice, and a rare stone, thus attacking at
once through the American's sense of business, security, and romance.<Node id="111872" />
<Node id="111873" />Certainly there had been a few minutes' danger when the Stone was
discovered to be no jewel, as jewels are ordinarily known; indeed,
Reginald had been driven to a rather hasty demonstration, which, in
its turn, startled Sheldrake so greatly as seriously to endanger the
negotiations.<Node id="112156" /> <Node id="112157" />Two ideas, however, occurred to the financier, though he
spoke of neither to Reginald; one was motor-cars and airways, the other
was his wife.<Node id="112299" /> <Node id="112300" />To protect the one and delight the other made it the aim
of his morning to procure the Stone, and the eventual seventy-three
thousand guineas at which it changed hands was a lesser matter.<Node id="112488" /> <Node id="112489" />Neither
of them were ever quite clear how that particular sum was reached;
though Reginald flattered himself that the guineas made it a far more
reputable transaction than if it had been merely pounds.<Node id="112690" /> <Node id="112691" />He had pressed
on Sheldrake the advisability of secrecy, but he had been compelled to
admit that a few other Stones of the kind were in existence--not more
than half a dozen.<Node id="112865" /> <Node id="112866" />The American had displayed some curiosity as to their
owners, but here the mere facts enabled Montague to be firm.<Node id="112980" /> <Node id="112981" />He admitted
that Sir Giles Tumulty had one; he thought the Chief Justice had; and he
himself--well, of course, he had kept one, that was reasonable.<Node id="113129" /> <Node id="113130" />But he
said nothing of his intention to spend the afternoon creating a few more
Stones nor of the names of buyers which were already floating in his
mind.<Node id="113284" /> <Node id="113285" />On his side Sheldrake said nothing of his intention to communicate
the mystery at least to his wife, nor of his anxiety to procure, if he
anyhow could, the other existing examples of it.<Node id="113471" /> <Node id="113472" />Equally satisfied,
equally unsatisfied, they parted, and while Reginald went first to his
office and then to Brighton, Sheldrake went straight by car to Rivington
Court.<Node id="113641" />

<Node id="113643" />He waited however till the next day, and till he had, rather nervously,
at a very early hour the next morning, tried a few more minor
experiments, before he spoke of the new treasure.<Node id="113826" /> <Node id="113827" />The experiments were
tried cautiously, in a small wood near the house, and were limited to
the crossing of a brook, the passage of a field, and so on, concluding
with the grand finale of a return to his own room, where he contentedly
locked the Stone away and went to breakfast.<Node id="114105" /> <Node id="114106" />It was some time later, not
very long before lunch, while Lord Arglay raged in London, that he took
his wife across the terraces and lawns to a hidden summer-house and
revealed the secret to her.<Node id="114301" />

<Node id="114303" />Cecilia took it with surprising calm--took, indeed, both the secret and
the Stone with a similar calm.<Node id="114405" /> <Node id="114406" />She was delighted, she was thrilled, but
with an obscure and egoistical acceptance of things she was not wildly
surprised.<Node id="114528" /> <Node id="114529" />If such treasures existed, they did so, both she and her
husband felt, chiefly for Cecilia Sheldrake.<Node id="114630" /> <Node id="114631" />Her life had refused her
only one thing--to be the first woman to fly the Atlantic, and Cecilia,
like everyone else, felt that life owed her every sort of gratification
in return for that disappointment.<Node id="114834" /> <Node id="114835" />Not that anything could really make
up for it, but other tributes might help her to forget.<Node id="114926" /> <Node id="114927" />Even miracles
were reasonable since they happened for her, and Angus, in the depths of
his nature, though his brain moved more slowly, felt that a world whose
chief miracles were the existence of Cecilia and her existence as his
wife might easily throw in a few more to make things pleasant for her.<Node id="115226" />
<Node id="115227" />She did indeed open her eyes a little at the price, but that also seemed
reasonable since it was for her, and she was more ready to risk extended
experiments than her husband had been.<Node id="115411" /> <Node id="115412" />Indeed it was she who made what
must up to then have been the longest journey yet taken by those high
means--at least for some centuries--in going direct to her bedroom in
London and returning with a dress she had left behind and had changed
her mind about on the way down the day before.<Node id="115700" /> <Node id="115701" />When she had safely
returned----<Node id="115733" />

<Node id="115735" />'<Node id="115736" />Darling, how sweet of you!<Node id="115762" />' <Node id="115764" />she cried to Angus.<Node id="115783" /> '<Node id="115785" />I never had anything
like it before.<Node id="115821" />'<Node id="115822" />

<Node id="115824" />'<Node id="115825" />I don't suppose many people have, or will have,' Angus said, with
justice.<Node id="115899" /> '<Node id="115901" />Not many will have the chance.<Node id="115931" />'<Node id="115932" />

<Node id="115934" />'<Node id="115935" />But will _anybody_?<Node id="115954" />' <Node id="115956" />Cecilia said, a little shocked.<Node id="115987" /> '<Node id="115989" />Are there more of
them?<Node id="116012" />'<Node id="116013" />

<Node id="116015" />'<Node id="116016" />Only about half a dozen, I gathered,' Angus told her.<Node id="116069" /> '<Node id="116071" />And I don't know
who's going to buy them.<Node id="116112" />'<Node id="116113" />

<Node id="116115" />Cecilia looked depressed.<Node id="116140" /> '<Node id="116142" />Where did they come from?<Node id="116167" />' <Node id="116169" />she asked in a
moment.<Node id="116191" />

<Node id="116193" />'<Node id="116194" />Sir Giles Tumulty brought them from the East, Montague said,' Angus
answered.<Node id="116271" /> '<Node id="116273" />He's a traveller and explorer.<Node id="116303" />'<Node id="116304" />

<Node id="116306" />His wife looked at him meditatively.<Node id="116342" /> '<Node id="116344" />You don't think he'd sell them
_all_?<Node id="116381" />' <Node id="116383" />she asked.<Node id="116393" /> '<Node id="116395" />O Angus, if somebody else got hold of them.<Node id="116438" />'<Node id="116439" />

<Node id="116441" />'<Node id="116442" />Well, Sir Giles has,' Sheldrake pointed out.<Node id="116486" />

<Node id="116488" />'<Node id="116489" />O him!<Node id="116495" />' <Node id="116497" />Cecilia said.<Node id="116510" /> '<Node id="116512" />I mean somebody else like us.<Node id="116541" />' <Node id="116543" />She sat up
suddenly.<Node id="116563" /> '<Node id="116565" />Angus!<Node id="116571" /> <Node id="116572" />What about Airways?<Node id="116591" />'<Node id="116592" />

<Node id="116594" />'<Node id="116595" />I know,' Angus said, 'I thought the same thing.<Node id="116642" /> <Node id="116643" />It might be awkward.<Node id="116663" /> <Node id="116664" />Of
course, it's not so bad because you'd want to be pretty sure of anyone
before you lent them the Stone.<Node id="116769" />'<Node id="116770" />

<Node id="116772" />Cecilia shook her head.<Node id="116795" /> '<Node id="116797" />We mayn't know everything,' she said.<Node id="116834" /> '<Node id="116836" />They may
have cheated you.<Node id="116862" /> <Node id="116863" />This Mr. Montague didn't _say_ it was the only one?<Node id="116914" />'<Node id="116915" />

<Node id="116917" />'<Node id="116918" />Sweetheart, he said it _wasn't_,' Angus pointed out.<Node id="116970" />

<Node id="116972" />'<Node id="116973" />Then he _has_ cheated you,' Cecilia said impatiently.<Node id="117026" /> '<Node id="117028" />O Angus, we
_must_ put it right.<Node id="117060" /> <Node id="117061" />After all, the Airways ought to have control,
oughtn't they?<Node id="117121" />'<Node id="117122" />

<Node id="117124" />'<Node id="117125" />It may be a little awkward,' Angus answered.<Node id="117169" /> '<Node id="117171" />I think one of them is
with the Lord Chief Justice.<Node id="117222" />'<Node id="117223" />

<Node id="117225" />Cecilia opened her eyes.<Node id="117249" /> '<Node id="117251" />But I thought judges weren't supposed to have
financial interests,' she exclaimed.<Node id="117333" /> '<Node id="117335" />Isn't it corruption?<Node id="117355" />... <Node id="117359" />Angus,
they can't _make_ them, can they?<Node id="117399" />'<Node id="117400" />

<Node id="117402" />'<Node id="117403" />What!<Node id="117408" />' <Node id="117410" />said her husband, startled.<Node id="117437" /> '<Node id="117439" />Make them?<Node id="117449" /> <Node id="117450" />O no--at least I suppose
not.<Node id="117479" /> <Node id="117480" />They came from the East.<Node id="117504" />'<Node id="117505" />

<Node id="117507" />'<Node id="117508" />Yes, but do they _make_ them in the East, or dig them up, or magnetize
them, or something?<Node id="117598" />' <Node id="117600" />Cecilia persisted.<Node id="117618" /> '<Node id="117620" />Angus dear, you must see what I
mean.<Node id="117657" /> <Node id="117658" />If there was a mine now, how dreadful it would be.<Node id="117708" />'<Node id="117709" />

<Node id="117711" />'<Node id="117712" />Darling, I think you're getting unnecessarily alarmed,' Sheldrake
protested.<Node id="117788" /> '<Node id="117790" />There can't be a mine--not possibly--not of stones that do
this.<Node id="117854" />'<Node id="117855" />

<Node id="117857" />'<Node id="117858" />Why not?<Node id="117866" />' <Node id="117868" />Cecilia asked.<Node id="117882" />

<Node id="117884" />'<Node id="117885" />Well, could there?<Node id="117903" /> <Node id="117904" />It isn't reasonable,' her husband urged.<Node id="117944" /> '<Node id="117946" />Stones
like this _must_ be rare.<Node id="117978" />' <Node id="117980" />But he looked uneasily at it as he spoke.<Node id="118021" />

<Node id="118023" />'<Node id="118024" />Anyhow--it's near lunchtime--anyhow I think you ought to do something.<Node id="118094" />
<Node id="118095" />Get it forbidden by law or something.<Node id="118132" />'<Node id="118133" />

<Node id="118135" />'<Node id="118136" />But then what about us?<Node id="118159" />' <Node id="118161" />Sheldrake asked.<Node id="118177" />

<Node id="118179" />Cecilia took his arm.<Node id="118200" /> '<Node id="118202" />Darling,' she said, 'you're awfully slow.<Node id="118243" /> <Node id="118244" />There
could always be a special license to the Airways.<Node id="118299" />'<Node id="118300" />

<Node id="118302" />'<Node id="118303" />It'd be very difficult to explain to the Home Secretary without telling
him everything, and I don't know that I want to tell him everything,'
Angus murmured.<Node id="118460" /> '<Node id="118462" />Besides, if one license is granted others could be, and
suppose you got a Labour Government in again?<Node id="118563" />'<Node id="118564" />

<Node id="118566" />Cecilia almost stamped.<Node id="118589" /> '<Node id="118591" />I suppose you could buy a monopoly or a
charter or something of that sort for twenty-one years or so?<Node id="118692" />' <Node id="118694" />she asked
plaintively.<Node id="118716" /> '<Node id="118718" />Darling Angus, we do want to stop it going further, don't
we?<Node id="118779" />'<Node id="118780" />

<Node id="118782" />'<Node id="118783" />O rather, yes,' Angus agreed.<Node id="118812" /> '<Node id="118814" />It's the explaining that will be
difficult.<Node id="118857" />'<Node id="118858" />

<Node id="118860" />'<Node id="118861" />It won't be any more difficult for you than for me to explain to Elise
how this frock came down here,' his wife said.<Node id="118978" /> '<Node id="118980" />Dearest, it's a lovely
present and I do thank you _enormously_.<Node id="119043" /> <Node id="119044" />But if you could just prevent
anyone else having one, it would be too perfectly sweet!<Node id="119130" /> <Node id="119131" />You will try,
won't you?<Node id="119155" />'<Node id="119156" />

<Node id="119158" />'<Node id="119159" />O I'll try,' Angus answered, kissing her.<Node id="119200" /> '<Node id="119202" />But it'll take some doing.<Node id="119228" />
<Node id="119229" />There'd have to be an Act, I'm afraid--and if the Lord Chief Justice was
nasty----'<Node id="119312" />

<Node id="119314" />'<Node id="119315" />He wouldn't have anything to do with politics though, would he?<Node id="119378" />'
<Node id="119380" />Cecilia asked.<Node id="119394" /> '<Node id="119396" />And as a matter of fact he might, if you put it to him
nicely, be willing to sell.<Node id="119478" />'<Node id="119479" />

<Node id="119481" />They returned to the house to lunch.<Node id="119517" />

<Node id="119519" />About the same time a less elaborate lunch was being served in the inn
of the village close by to Chloe Burnett and Frank Lindsay.<Node id="119649" /> <Node id="119650" />Chloe had
been half-unwilling to leave London, for fear the Chief Justice should
want her, but a sense of duty, a necessity to recompense Frank for the
unsatisfactory result of the Friday evening, had compelled her to accept
his suggestion; though, for some undefined reason, she had caused him to
take Lancaster Gate on the way.<Node id="119979" /> <Node id="119980" />Lord Arglay's house had offered no more
information than she expected, but the sight of it enabled her more
freely to devote all her energies to making the day's amusement a
success.<Node id="120162" /> <Node id="120163" />She had received with interest and encouragement Frank's
serious efforts towards culture, although a part of her mind remotely
insisted on comparing his careful answers with Lord Arglay's casual
completeness.<Node id="120371" /> <Node id="120372" />Sir Giles's epigram on encyclopedias--'the slums of the
mind'--recurred to her, and she went so far to meet it as to admit that
Frank's information was rather like a block of model dwellings compared
with the tumultuous carelessness of a country house.<Node id="120624" /> <Node id="120625" />The contrast had
been suddenly provoked by Frank's short lecture in answer to her
question--'O by the way, what is a Sufi?<Node id="120747" />'<Node id="120748" />

<Node id="120750" />'<Node id="120751" />It is a Muhammedan sect,' he had answered.<Node id="120793" /> '<Node id="120795" />Muhammed, you know, who
was a fanatical monotheist, wrote the Koran, or rather claimed that the
Koran had been delivered to him by Gabriel.<Node id="120934" />' <Node id="120936" />He had gone on, with what
seemed a good many references to Muhammed.<Node id="121004" /> <Node id="121005" />Chloe's intelligence reminded
her that by the phrase 'Muhammed was a Fanatical monotheist' he meant
what Lord Arglay--or was it the Hajji?<Node id="121143" />--<Node id="121145" />had meant by saying 'Our lord
the Prophet arose to proclaim the Unity,' but she found the one phrase
unusually trying after the other.<Node id="121279" /> <Node id="121280" />As penance and compensation she
allowed her hand, which lay lightly in Frank's, to give it a small
squeeze of thanks, and diverted his attention by saying, 'O what a jolly
house!<Node id="121458" />'<Node id="121459" />

<Node id="121461" />The lecture had taken place soon after lunch while they were wandering
in the lanes round the village.<Node id="121563" /> <Node id="121564" />There was in fact very little of the
house to be seen--it was too far off and hidden by trees, but perhaps
sufficient to justify Chloe in saying, 'Let's go through that gate and
get a bit nearer.<Node id="121759" />'<Node id="121760" />

<Node id="121762" />'<Node id="121763" />You'll be trespassing,' Frank said, looking at the obviously private
road on the other side.<Node id="121855" />

<Node id="121857" />Chloe laid her hand on the latch and gazed along the empty road.<Node id="121921" /> '<Node id="121923" />Frank,
in two minutes,' she said, 'there will rush round that corner a herd of
maddened cows--look, there they are.<Node id="122038" /> <Node id="122039" />I shall take refuge behind this
gate, and I pull you in too.<Node id="122099" />' <Node id="122101" />She did, and shut it after them.<Node id="122133" /> '<Node id="122135" />Being
here, don't you think we might just go as far as that bend and see if we
can see the house better?<Node id="122239" />'<Node id="122240" />

<Node id="122242" />'<Node id="122243" />Certainly,' Frank said obligingly.<Node id="122277" /> '<Node id="122279" />As a matter of fact, according to
English law, trespassers----'<Node id="122342" />

<Node id="122344" />'<Node id="122345" />O don't talk about the law,' Chloe said very hastily.<Node id="122398" /> '<Node id="122400" />I don't want
anyone but Lord--the Chief Justice to talk to me about that.<Node id="122473" />'<Node id="122474" />

<Node id="122476" />'<Node id="122477" />Poor dear, you must get enough of it.<Node id="122514" /> <Node id="122515" />I forgot you live with it
perpetually,' Lindsay answered.<Node id="122572" /> '<Node id="122574" />You must be jolly glad to get away from
it a bit.<Node id="122623" />'<Node id="122624" />

<Node id="122626" />Chloe, with a certain throb of conscience, attended to the house, of
which a great deal more became visible as they reached the bend.<Node id="122759" /> <Node id="122760" />The
private road ran on towards it, but both the trespassers lingered.<Node id="122830" />

<Node id="122832" />'<Node id="122833" />It is rather jolly, isn't it?<Node id="122862" />' <Node id="122864" />Frank said, and stopped dead.<Node id="122893" /> <Node id="122894" />Chloe
gave a cry of fear.<Node id="122919" /> <Node id="122920" />For before the words had been well spoken or heard
the air in front of them seemed suddenly to quiver, a quick brightness
shone within it, and they found standing in front of them, where no one
had been, whither no one had come, a well-dressed young lady.<Node id="123175" /> <Node id="123176" />She seemed
to be equally startled, and her gurgling cry caught up Chloe's shriek.<Node id="123257" />
<Node id="123258" />There was a minute's silence while they all gazed, then----<Node id="123317" />

<Node id="123319" />'<Node id="123320" />The Stone,' Chloe cried out.<Node id="123348" /> '<Node id="123350" />You've got the Stone.<Node id="123371" />'<Node id="123372" />

<Node id="123374" />Rather shaken still, the stranger looked at her, but hostilely.<Node id="123437" />

<Node id="123439" />'<Node id="123440" />What do you mean?<Node id="123457" /> <Node id="123458" />what stone?<Node id="123469" />' <Node id="123471" />she asked.<Node id="123481" />

<Node id="123483" />'<Node id="123484" />You must have it,' Chloe said breathlessly.<Node id="123527" /> '<Node id="123529" />I know--I've seen.<Node id="123547" /> <Node id="123548" />It was
exactly that; the wind, the light, the--you.<Node id="123599" /> <Node id="123600" />You _have_ got the Stone.<Node id="123625" />'<Node id="123626" />

<Node id="123628" />Her words sounded almost accusingly.<Node id="123664" /> <Node id="123665" />Mrs. Sheldrake unconsciously
clenched her hand a little more tightly round what was, surely, her
property, and said: 'I suppose you know you're trespassing?<Node id="123821" />'<Node id="123822" />

<Node id="123824" />Frank re-acted to the commonplace remark, feeling that he must have been
day-dreaming a few moments.<Node id="123924" /> <Node id="123925" />The new arrival had, of course, walked up
the road.<Node id="123976" />

<Node id="123978" />'<Node id="123979" />We're so sorry,' he said.<Node id="124004" /> '<Node id="124006" />As a matter of fact we came in to
shelter----' He paused in a confused realization that he had been on
the point of repeating Chloe's preposterous tale about the cows.<Node id="124173" />

<Node id="124175" />'<Node id="124176" />To shelter!<Node id="124187" />' <Node id="124189" />the lady said.<Node id="124203" />

<Node id="124205" />'<Node id="124206" />Well, no, not to shelter,' Frank stammered, feeling suddenly angry
with Chloe, who was still staring, almost combatively.<Node id="124327" /> '<Node id="124329" />I'm so sorry--I
mean--we just came a step or two in to look at the house.<Node id="124402" /> <Node id="124403" />From here, I
mean.<Node id="124421" /> <Node id="124422" />We weren't going nearer.<Node id="124446" /> <Node id="124447" />I do apologize, I--I----'<Node id="124472" />

<Node id="124474" />Cecilia looked at Chloe.<Node id="124498" /> '<Node id="124500" />What did you mean by the Stone?<Node id="124531" />' <Node id="124533" />she asked
again.<Node id="124549" />

<Node id="124551" />'<Node id="124552" />I mean the Stone,' Chloe said with a clear vigour.<Node id="124602" /> '<Node id="124604" />Is there another
then, or have you bought one?<Node id="124650" />'<Node id="124651" />

<Node id="124653" />Cecilia came a step nearer.<Node id="124680" /> '<Node id="124682" />What do you mean about the Stone?<Node id="124715" />' <Node id="124717" />she
asked, and made a mistake which in a less startled moment she would not
have made.<Node id="124803" /> '<Node id="124805" />You had better tell me,' she added.<Node id="124840" />

<Node id="124842" />Chloe flushed a little.<Node id="124865" /> '<Node id="124867" />I shall certainly not----' she began, and
stopped as a confused dream of Lord Arglay, Charlemagne, Gabriel, the
Tetragrammaton, and the End of Desire swept across her.<Node id="125034" /> '<Node id="125036" />I beg your
pardon,' she went on.<Node id="125068" /> '<Node id="125070" />It was only that I was so surprised.<Node id="125106" />'<Node id="125107" />

<Node id="125109" />'<Node id="125110" />Is this Mr. Montague?<Node id="125131" />' <Node id="125133" />Cecilia asked, abruptly shifting her attack to
Frank, who was too taken aback to do more than begin a hasty denial
before Chloe interrupted him.<Node id="125277" />

<Node id="125279" />'<Node id="125280" />No,' she said, 'he has nothing to do with it.<Node id="125325" /> <Node id="125326" />Are you Mrs. Sheldrake?<Node id="125349" />'<Node id="125350" />

<Node id="125352" />'<Node id="125353" />I am Mrs. Sheldrake,' the other said, 'but what do you know?<Node id="125413" />'<Node id="125414" />

<Node id="125416" />Chloe hesitated.<Node id="125432" /> '<Node id="125434" />I know that you have one of the Stones,' she said,
'but it ought not to have been bought or sold.<Node id="125531" /> <Node id="125532" />It wasn't Mr. Montague's
and it can't be yours.<Node id="125579" />'<Node id="125580" />

<Node id="125582" />'<Node id="125583" />Don't be absurd,' Cecilia said sharply.<Node id="125622" /> '<Node id="125624" />How many of these Stones are
there then?<Node id="125664" />'<Node id="125665" />

<Node id="125667" />'<Node id="125668" />I don't know,' Chloe answered truthfully.<Node id="125709" /> '<Node id="125711" />There was only one at first,
but that can't be yours for that was in the Crown.<Node id="125790" />'<Node id="125791" />

<Node id="125793" />'<Node id="125794" />The Crown?<Node id="125804" /> <Node id="125805" />what Crown?<Node id="125816" />' <Node id="125818" />Cecilia asked again, feeling that this was
intolerable.<Node id="125873" /> <Node id="125874" />There were, it seemed, goodness knows how many of these
Stones--and now there was more talk of a Crown--as if seventy-three
thousand guineas oughtn't to have bought the whole thing.<Node id="126055" /> <Node id="126056" />She was
half-inclined to throw the Stone in the girl's face--only that would
be silly; as a mere precaution she ought to keep it.<Node id="126185" />

<Node id="126187" />Chloe said anxiously, 'You ought to see Lord Arglay; the Chief Justice,
I mean.<Node id="126266" /> <Node id="126267" />He could tell you better than I can.<Node id="126303" /> <Node id="126304" />He's Mr. Montague's uncle
and he warned him not to sell it.<Node id="126363" />'<Node id="126364" />

<Node id="126366" />'<Node id="126367" />Is it Lord Arglay's property then?<Node id="126401" />' <Node id="126403" />Cecilia answered.<Node id="126420" />

<Node id="126422" />'<Node id="126423" />I don't know whose property it is,' Chloe admitted rather helplessly.<Node id="126492" />
'<Node id="126494" />But you ought to be very careful what you do with it.<Node id="126547" />'<Node id="126548" />

<Node id="126550" />'<Node id="126551" />I should like very much to see Lord Arglay,' Mrs. Sheldrake said, 'if
he could make things any clearer.<Node id="126654" />' <Node id="126656" />She lifted the hand that held the
Stone.<Node id="126696" /> '<Node id="126698" />Can we reach him by this?<Node id="126723" />'<Node id="126724" />

<Node id="126726" />'<Node id="126727" />Certainly not,' Chloe said, with a return of firmness.<Node id="126781" /> '<Node id="126783" />We can't use
the Stone of Suleiman for that.<Node id="126827" />'<Node id="126828" />

<Node id="126830" />'<Node id="126831" />My good girl,' Cecilia said contemptuously, 'that's what it's for.<Node id="126897" />'<Node id="126898" />

<Node id="126900" />'<Node id="126901" />It isn't,' Chloe cried out, 'and if you use it for that you've got no
business with it.<Node id="126988" /> <Node id="126989" />Any more than Mr. Montague.<Node id="127016" /> <Node id="127017" />It's for getting
somewhere.<Node id="127044" />'<Node id="127045" />

<Node id="127047" />'<Node id="127048" />Well,' said Mrs. Sheldrake, 'I want to get to Lord Arglay.<Node id="127106" /> <Node id="127107" />Will you
tell me how and where I can find him?<Node id="127153" /> <Node id="127154" />Or must I do it myself?<Node id="127177" />'<Node id="127178" />

<Node id="127180" />'<Node id="127181" />O don't,' Chloe said.<Node id="127202" /> '<Node id="127204" />He's in London, I think.<Node id="127228" />' <Node id="127230" />She gave the address.<Node id="127251" />
'<Node id="127253" />But he won't be pleased if you use the Stone.<Node id="127298" />'<Node id="127299" />

<Node id="127301" />'<Node id="127302" />I shall go,' Mrs. Sheldrake announced, 'by car.<Node id="127349" /> <Node id="127350" />And now don't you think
you'd better get out of these grounds?<Node id="127412" />'<Node id="127413" />

<Node id="127415" />Mr.<Node id="127418" /> <Node id="127419" />Lindsay, who had been anxious to do so for the last five minutes,
flung her a vicious glance and started.<Node id="127524" /> <Node id="127525" />Chloe, who wanted to say a good
deal without saying anything, gave her intelligence the victory and
accompanied him.<Node id="127641" /> <Node id="127642" />But over at the gate she seized his hand and forced him
to run with her.<Node id="127714" /> '<Node id="127716" />Quick,' she said, 'quick.<Node id="127741" /> <Node id="127742" />We must get back to London.<Node id="127769" />'<Node id="127770" />

<Node id="127772" />'<Node id="127773" />London?<Node id="127780" />' <Node id="127782" />Frank protested.<Node id="127798" /> '<Node id="127800" />Why on earth----?<Node id="127817" /> <Node id="127818" />Why, it's not three yet.<Node id="127842" />
<Node id="127843" />Surely----'<Node id="127854" />

<Node id="127856" />'<Node id="127857" />O we _must_,' Chloe exclaimed.<Node id="127887" /> '<Node id="127889" />I must see Lord Arglay.<Node id="127912" /> <Node id="127913" />I must find out
if I've done right.<Node id="127948" /> <Node id="127949" />I must see what he says to her.<Node id="127980" />'<Node id="127981" />

<Node id="127983" />'<Node id="127984" />But surely he can manage her _without_ you,' Frank said.<Node id="128040" /> '<Node id="128042" />It can't be
so absolutely vital to you to be there.<Node id="128093" /> <Node id="128094" />If she's got something that
doesn't belong to her, I shouldn't think she really does want to see
him----I should think it was all bluff.<Node id="128230" /> <Node id="128231" />If,' he added, 'you'd tell me
what it's all about I should know better what we ought to do.<Node id="128322" />'<Node id="128323" />

<Node id="128325" />What they ought to do was not Chloe's concern; what she was going to do
she knew perfectly well.<Node id="128421" /> <Node id="128422" />She was going straight back to Lancaster Gate;
so straight that the idea of telephoning occurred to her only to be
dismissed.<Node id="128547" /> <Node id="128548" />Nor had she any intention of explaining to Frank; she had
been agreeable to him all day, it was now his turn to start being
agreeable.<Node id="128682" /> <Node id="128683" />She kept up a steady speed towards the inn.<Node id="128726" />

<Node id="128728" />'<Node id="128729" />I can't explain now,' she said after a moment or two.<Node id="128782" /> '<Node id="128784" />If I possibly
can I'll tell you some other time.<Node id="128832" /> <Node id="128833" />The Foreign Office comes into it,'
she added, as an exciting suggestion.<Node id="128905" /> '<Node id="128907" />But don't talk now--run.<Node id="128931" />'<Node id="128932" />

<Node id="128934" />It appeared to Frank the most curious day in the country with a girl
friend that he had ever spent.<Node id="129033" /> <Node id="129034" />Short of Bolsheviks--in whom he was
reluctant to believe, being a typical Liberal in politics, though he
professed a cynical independence--he couldn't imagine why the Foreign
Office should come in.<Node id="129231" /> <Node id="129232" />But he was genuinely anxious to please Chloe, and
though he offered one or two more disjointed protests he headed the car
for London as soon as possible, once they had reached the inn; warning
Chloe, however, that this little two-seater was unlikely to be able to
arrive before whatever kind of magnificent car the Sheldrakes owned.<Node id="129564" />

<Node id="129566" />'<Node id="129567" />O but we _must_,' she said.<Node id="129594" /> '<Node id="129596" />Try, Frank, try.<Node id="129612" /> <Node id="129613" />I _must_ be there when
she gets there.<Node id="129651" /> <Node id="129652" />I must know what's happening.<Node id="129681" />'<Node id="129682" />

<Node id="129684" />'<Node id="129685" />But what is this blessed Stone?<Node id="129716" />' <Node id="129718" />Frank asked.<Node id="129730" />

<Node id="129732" />'<Node id="129733" />Darling, don't worry now,' Chloe urged him.<Node id="129776" /> '<Node id="129778" />Just see to getting on.<Node id="129801" />
<Node id="129802" />Lancaster Gate, you know.<Node id="129827" /> <Node id="129828" />As quick as ever.<Node id="129845" />'<Node id="129846" />

<Node id="129848" />'<Node id="129849" />I might be a taximan,' Frank let out.<Node id="129886" /> '<Node id="129888" />All right.<Node id="129898" />'<Node id="129899" />

<Node id="129901" />They fled through various lanes and emerged on a more important side
road which would take them on to the main road for London.<Node id="130028" /> <Node id="130029" />As soon as
they did so however Frank began to slow down.<Node id="130085" /> <Node id="130086" />A short distance in front
of them, halfway up the steep bank, was another car, and out of it Mrs.
Sheldrake was scrambling.<Node id="130209" />

<Node id="130211" />'<Node id="130212" />O don't stop,' Chloe cried, but Cecilia had recognized them and run
into the middle of the road.<Node id="130308" />

<Node id="130310" />'<Node id="130311" />Stop,' she said, and Frank was compelled to obey.<Node id="130360" /> <Node id="130361" />She came up and
addressed Chloe.<Node id="130393" />

<Node id="130395" />'<Node id="130396" />A most annoying thing has happened,' she said, 'and perhaps you'll
help us.<Node id="130471" /> <Node id="130472" />The Stone's somewhere over there.<Node id="130505" />' <Node id="130507" />She pointed to the bank and
the hedge.<Node id="130545" /> '<Node id="130547" />I was looking at it in the car and Angus--Mr.<Node id="130592" /> <Node id="130593" />Sheldrake--had
to swerve suddenly and it flew out of my hand, and now he can't find
it.<Node id="130680" />'<Node id="130681" />

<Node id="130683" />'<Node id="130684" />What!<Node id="130689" />' <Node id="130691" />Chloe exclaimed.<Node id="130707" />

<Node id="130709" />'<Node id="130710" />It must be there,' Cecilia went on sharply.<Node id="130753" /> '<Node id="130755" />I was just holding it up
to the sun, to get the colour in the light, and the car jerked, and it
had gone.<Node id="130860" /> <Node id="130861" />But it's only just over there, it must be, and I thought you
wouldn't mind helping us look.<Node id="130952" />'<Node id="130953" />

<Node id="130955" />Chloe was out of the car in a moment.<Node id="130992" /> '<Node id="130994" />You've lost it,' she said.<Node id="131020" /> '<Node id="131022" />O
Mrs. Sheldrake!<Node id="131039" />'<Node id="131040" />

<Node id="131042" />'<Node id="131043" />It can't possibly be _lost_,' Cecilia assured, rather annoyed.<Node id="131105" /> '<Node id="131107" />And
please--I'm afraid I don't know your name--remember that it's my
property.<Node id="131185" />'<Node id="131186" />

<Node id="131188" />'<Node id="131189" />We can settle that after,' Chloe said, beginning to mount the bank.<Node id="131256" /> '<Node id="131258" />We
can't possibly leave it lying about for someone to pick up.<Node id="131320" /> <Node id="131321" />We can ask
Lord Arglay whom it ought to belong to.<Node id="131371" />'<Node id="131372" />

<Node id="131374" />'<Node id="131375" />This,' Frank put in before Mrs. Sheldrake could speak, 'is Miss
Burnett.<Node id="131447" /> <Node id="131448" />She is the Chief Justice's secretary,' he added as impressively
as possible, as Chloe caught the hedge at the top of the bank, pulled
herself up, and wriggled and pushed through.<Node id="131626" /> '<Node id="131628" />My name is Lindsay.<Node id="131647" />'<Node id="131648" />

<Node id="131650" />Cecilia eyed the bank.<Node id="131672" /> '<Node id="131674" />Well, Angus?<Node id="131686" />' <Node id="131688" />she called.<Node id="131699" />

<Node id="131701" />A rather strained voice answered her from above--'No, no luck.<Node id="131763" />
<Node id="131764" />O--er--are you helping?<Node id="131787" /> <Node id="131788" />Somewhere about here, we thought.<Node id="131821" />'<Node id="131822" />

<Node id="131824" />'<Node id="131825" />Will you help me too, Mr. Lindsay?<Node id="131859" />' <Node id="131861" />Cecilia asked.<Node id="131875" /> '<Node id="131877" />So tiresome, all
this business.<Node id="131908" /> <Node id="131909" />But one can't afford to throw away seventy thousand
guineas.<Node id="131969" />' <Node id="131971" />Some reason, after all, had to be given to this young man who
was obviously in a state of mere bewilderment, and perhaps the price----<Node id="132105" />

<Node id="132107" />So far she was right.<Node id="132128" /> <Node id="132129" />He gaped at her.<Node id="132145" /> '<Node id="132147" />A stone,' he said.<Node id="132165" /> '<Node id="132167" />But what
kind of a stone then?<Node id="132197" />'<Node id="132198" />

<Node id="132200" />'<Node id="132201" />O about _so_ large,' Cecilia told him.<Node id="132239" /> '<Node id="132241" />A kind of cream colour, with
gold flakings, and funny black marks.<Node id="132307" /> _<Node id="132309" />Will_ you?<Node id="132319" /> <Node id="132320" />It would be so good of
you.<Node id="132347" /> <Node id="132348" />Miss Burnett's too kind.<Node id="132372" /> <Node id="132373" />All four of us ought to find it, oughtn't
we?<Node id="132418" /> <Node id="132419" />Thank you.<Node id="132429" />'<Node id="132430" />

<Node id="132432" />He began to help her to climb.<Node id="132462" /> <Node id="132463" />Why Chloe, who had been so intent on
rushing to London--but of course if the stone was really worth seventy
thousand--seventy thousand, it would be rather fascinating even to see a
stone worth that.<Node id="132661" />

<Node id="132663" />But half an hour's search, though they all tramped round, parted the
thick grass, bent and grovelled and peered, brought them no nearer
success.<Node id="132807" /> <Node id="132808" />Cecilia, Angus felt, could hardly have chosen a worse place to
look at the Stone; nor could Angus, his wife felt in turn, have chosen a
worse place to swerve.<Node id="132966" /> <Node id="132967" />For besides the bank and hedge by the road, at
this particular point two fields were divided by another thorny hedge,
at the base of which the grass on each side grew long.<Node id="133139" /> <Node id="133140" />There were
nettles and thistles and much larger stones on which the men seemed to
be continually kneeling, and they all had a feeling that any one of the
others might be trampling it into the ground at any moment.<Node id="133353" /> <Node id="133354" />And Cecilia
distrusted Chloe and Frank, and Chloe distrusted Cecilia and Angus,
and Frank was wondering what the whole business meant, and Angus was
wondering who the strangers were, and as they searched this wonder,
suspicion, and irritation grew every moment more violent.<Node id="133628" /> <Node id="133629" />But the End of
Desire remained hidden.<Node id="133667" />

<Node id="133669" />At last, as they met in their circumambulations, Frank murmured to
Chloe, 'Is this really our business?<Node id="133772" /> <Node id="133773" />Is it your Stone or theirs?<Node id="133800" />'<Node id="133801" />

<Node id="133803" />'<Node id="133804" />It isn't mine,' Chloe said, trying not to sound irritable but conscious
she was looking hot and dirty and anxious, 'but it isn't really theirs.<Node id="133947" />
<Node id="133948" />They bought it all right, but they oughtn't to have it.<Node id="134003" />'<Node id="134004" />

<Node id="134006" />'<Node id="134007" />Are you tired out, Mr. Lindsay?<Node id="134038" />' <Node id="134040" />Cecilia called impatiently.<Node id="134067" /> '<Node id="134069" />It _must_
be somewhere here.<Node id="134097" />'<Node id="134098" />

<Node id="134100" />'<Node id="134101" />Yes, Mrs. Sheldrake,' Frank rebelled suddenly, 'but Miss Burnett wanted
to get to London, and really we seem to be going over the same ground
again and again.<Node id="134259" />'<Node id="134260" />

<Node id="134262" />'<Node id="134263" />Please don't stop then,' Cecilia said.<Node id="134301" /> '<Node id="134303" />I'm sorry to have kept you.<Node id="134330" />'<Node id="134331" />

<Node id="134333" />'<Node id="134334" />O nonsense,' Chloe broke in.<Node id="134362" /> '<Node id="134364" />Of course we must stop.<Node id="134387" /> <Node id="134388" />We _must_ find
it.<Node id="134406" /> <Node id="134407" />We can't let a thing like that be about loose.<Node id="134453" /> <Node id="134454" />If _someone's_ got it
at least we shall know where it is, if not whose.<Node id="134525" />'<Node id="134526" />

<Node id="134528" />'<Node id="134529" />There's no question of that,' Cecilia threw at her, 'since we paid for
it.<Node id="134603" /> <Node id="134604" />As it is, I think your friend Mr. Montague has cheated us.<Node id="134662" />'<Node id="134663" />

<Node id="134665" />'<Node id="134666" />He is _not_----' Chloe began and then remembered she was looking for
the End of Desire.<Node id="134753" /> <Node id="134754" />With a muddled prayer to the Stone--since, being
a modern normally emotional girl she was, quite naturally, an
idolater--she stopped and, to her own astonishment, experienced a sudden
flicker of amused peace, accompanied by a clearer intellectual survey.<Node id="135008" />

<Node id="135010" />'<Node id="135011" />But we are getting confused, I think,' she said.<Node id="135059" />

<Node id="135061" />At this moment Angus, having stung himself again, swore violently and
got up, kneeling on something sharp as he did so.<Node id="135180" /> <Node id="135181" />Moved by this exactly
as by unexpected opposition at a board meeting he began to decide things
at once.<Node id="135284" /> '<Node id="135286" />We can't go on like this,' he said.<Node id="135321" /> '<Node id="135323" />After all, so long as
things are left undisturbed here we're damn well certain to find it if
I have every blade of grass pulled up separately.<Node id="135465" /> <Node id="135466" />The point is--do you
want to go to London now, Cecilia, or back to the Court?<Node id="135543" />'<Node id="135544" />

<Node id="135546" />His wife looked at Chloe, who knew the Chief Justice.<Node id="135599" /> <Node id="135600" />Let her talk to
him while she sat ignorant?<Node id="135643" /> <Node id="135644" />Never.<Node id="135650" /> <Node id="135651" />If they couldn't find this stone they
could anyhow get on the track of the others.<Node id="135733" />

<Node id="135735" />'<Node id="135736" />London,' she said.<Node id="135754" /> '<Node id="135756" />But you had better stop here, Angus, and perhaps
Mr. Lindsay will go back to the Court and send someone to you.<Node id="135867" />'<Node id="135868" />

<Node id="135870" />Chloe felt clear that this would do what she wanted with Frank without
her interfering.<Node id="135957" /> <Node id="135958" />She went on moving the grass with her foot and looking
at the ground, as did everyone else except Frank who glanced back
towards the road and said coldly, 'I'm afraid that's impossible.<Node id="136143" /> <Node id="136144" />Miss
Burnett wants to go to London too.<Node id="136183" />'<Node id="136184" />

<Node id="136186" />There was a short silence.<Node id="136212" /> <Node id="136213" />Then Angus, still murmuring curses, said
abruptly to his wife, 'Then you'd better take the car and get on to
London with Miss Burnett.<Node id="136347" /> <Node id="136348" />And I'll stop here, and then perhaps Mr.
Lindsay won't mind going back to the Court.<Node id="136432" />'<Node id="136433" />

<Node id="136435" />'<Node id="136436" />I shall very much mind,' Lindsay answered.<Node id="136478" /> '<Node id="136480" />I am going to take Miss
Burnett to London at once--myself.<Node id="136538" /> <Node id="136539" />I daresay someone will pass pretty
soon who'll take a message for you.<Node id="136609" />'<Node id="136610" />

<Node id="136612" />Chloe's hand on his arm distracted him.<Node id="136651" /> '<Node id="136653" />Frank dear,' she said,
'_Would_ you go?<Node id="136692" /> <Node id="136693" />I know it sounds beastly, but if you would....<Node id="136739" />'<Node id="136740" />

<Node id="136742" />Frank stared at her.<Node id="136762" /> '<Node id="136764" />Do you want me to?<Node id="136782" />' <Node id="136784" />he asked stupidly.<Node id="136802" />

<Node id="136804" />'<Node id="136805" />I don't--I don't--want you to,' Chloe in confusion murmured.<Node id="136865" /> '<Node id="136867" />But I
think it would be--O sporting--of you.<Node id="136911" /> <Node id="136912" />It's not a bit nice, but I think
we ought.<Node id="136954" />'<Node id="136955" />

<Node id="136957" />'<Node id="136958" />I think it's perfectly insane,' Frank answered in a low voice.<Node id="137020" /> '<Node id="137022" />Do you
want them to have their own way altogether?<Node id="137072" />'<Node id="137073" />

<Node id="137075" />'<Node id="137076" />Not altogether,' Chloe protested, also speaking softly, 'but it seems
as if we ought,' she ended again lamely.<Node id="137186" />

<Node id="137188" />Frank, in a very bad temper, gave way.<Node id="137226" /> '<Node id="137228" />O anything you like, of course,'
he said coldly.<Node id="137276" /> '<Node id="137278" />I go back to this Court then, and after that I can come
to London by myself, I suppose?<Node id="137365" />'<Node id="137366" />

<Node id="137368" />'<Node id="137369" />I know it's beastly, Frank,' Chloe answered appealingly.<Node id="137425" /> '<Node id="137427" />I'd go myself
or I'd come with you--I'd love to come with you--but I must get to Lord
Arglay as soon as Mrs. Sheldrake.<Node id="137546" />' <Node id="137548" />She was not quite clear why, since
she realized even then that two sentences of Cecilia's conversation
would let the Chief Justice know everything.<Node id="137695" /> <Node id="137696" />But she could not yet face
that abolition of her own secret desires which the abandonment of any
attempt to witness their meeting would involve.<Node id="137840" /> <Node id="137841" />Besides, Frank would
be bound to want to know--still, it was hard on him and it was quite
natural he should turn away and say to Sheldrake very politely, 'Miss
Burnett thinks your suggestion a very good one, and so do I. Will Mrs.
Sheldrake take her on to London then?<Node id="138109" />'<Node id="138110" />

<Node id="138112" />Cecilia with a cold grudge assented.<Node id="138148" /> <Node id="138149" />But Chloe said suddenly to
Angus--'O but, Mr. Sheldrake, if you _do_ find it, you'll tell us, won't
you?<Node id="138253" /> <Node id="138254" />That would be only fair.<Node id="138278" />' <Node id="138280" />Angus agreed.<Node id="138293" /> '<Node id="138295" />If I find it I'll let you
know at once,' he said.<Node id="138344" /> '<Node id="138346" />At Lord Arglay's?<Node id="138363" />'<Node id="138364" />

<Node id="138366" />'<Node id="138367" />Please,' Chloe said gratefully, and tried to catch Frank's eye.<Node id="138430" />
<Node id="138431" />She failed, and went sadly to the bank.<Node id="138470" /> <Node id="138471" />She was always doing the
selfish thing, she felt.<Node id="138520" /> <Node id="138521" />But after all Lord Arglay might--might very
easily--want several things done at once when he knew the situation.<Node id="138633" /> <Node id="138634" />She
wished she wanted to be with Frank a little more strongly.<Node id="138696" /> <Node id="138697" />Duty with a
strong inclination looked so dreadfully selfish besides duty with a mild
inclination.<Node id="138794" /> <Node id="138795" />She sat down gloomily in the Sheldrakes' car and it moved
off.<Node id="138857" />

<Node id="138859" />The two men looked at each other.<Node id="138892" /> '<Node id="138894" />I don't understand what all this is
about,' Frank said, 'or whose this precious stone is.<Node id="138983" /> <Node id="138984" />But I have your
word that if you find it while I'm gone, or at all for that matter,
you'll let us know.<Node id="139087" />'<Node id="139088" />

<Node id="139090" />'<Node id="139091" />I don't mind telling you what _I_ know,' Angus answered.<Node id="139147" /> '<Node id="139149" />I bought,
from a fellow named Montague, who seems to be a nephew of this Lord
Arglay your friend's so keen on, a rather valuable stone for my wife.<Node id="139296" />
<Node id="139297" />She understood that it was--well, practically, unique--and now there
seems to be some question on our side of misrepresentation, and on
yours--theirs, I mean,--of other rights in the property.<Node id="139489" /> <Node id="139490" />I daresay it
can all be settled by a few minutes' chat between me and Lord Arglay
or whoever knows, but till then, since I've parted with my money, I
consider I've a right to hold the stone.<Node id="139680" /> <Node id="139681" />But I'm anxious to be quite
fair and I'll certainly let you or Miss Burnett know if it's found.<Node id="139776" /> <Node id="139777" />I
shall have a very careful search made, and if it's necessary I shall buy
both these fields.<Node id="139870" />'<Node id="139871" />

<Node id="139873" />'<Node id="139874" />I see,' Frank said, a little impressed by this method of dealing with
difficulties.<Node id="139957" /> '<Node id="139959" />And you want me to go and let your people know where you
are.<Node id="140020" />'<Node id="140021" />

<Node id="140023" />'<Node id="140024" />If you will,' Angus assented.<Node id="140053" /> '<Node id="140055" />It's very good of you, but you'll agree
that Miss Burnett seemed almost as keen as my wife.<Node id="140146" />'<Node id="140147" />

<Node id="140149" />'<Node id="140150" />O yes' Frank answered gloomily.<Node id="140181" /> '<Node id="140183" />What's the best way to your place from
here?<Node id="140227" />'<Node id="140228" />

<Node id="140230" />Sheldrake told him and he departed, car and all.<Node id="140278" /> <Node id="140279" />Angus, allowing about
an hour before he was relieved, lit a cigarette and sat down under the
hedge to wait.<Node id="140386" /> <Node id="140387" />He was too tired to do any more searching; indeed, when
the cigarette was finished, he found himself disinclined to move in
order to reach another, but, stretching himself out, lay half-asleep and
half-brooding.<Node id="140598" />

<Node id="140600" />He was only partly conscious of feet that sounded on the other side of
the hedge, though a certain subconscious knowledge told him that someone
was coming along a footpath that ran alongside the hedge, a couple of
feet away.<Node id="140824" /> <Node id="140825" />As they came nearer however he moved so as to be just in time
to see a tall figure take a short stride up to the hedge, reach up and
pick something from the top of the intertwining twigs.<Node id="141012" /> <Node id="141013" />A sudden fear
assailed him.<Node id="141040" /> <Node id="141041" />The stranger was back on the footpath before Angus could
scramble to his feet, and was beginning to move away by the time he
reached the hedge.<Node id="141184" />

<Node id="141186" />'<Node id="141187" />Hi!<Node id="141190" />' <Node id="141192" />Angus cried out, seriously alarmed.<Node id="141227" /> '<Node id="141229" />Hi, you!<Node id="141237" />'<Node id="141238" />

<Node id="141240" />The stranger paused and looked back.<Node id="141276" /> <Node id="141277" />He was a tall, rather dark young
man, of about thirty, carrying sketching materials, and he looked at
Angus with a certain hard surprise.<Node id="141414" />

<Node id="141416" />'<Node id="141417" />Hi!<Node id="141420" />' <Node id="141422" />said Angus again.<Node id="141439" /> '<Node id="141441" />Is that mine?<Node id="141454" />'<Node id="141455" />

<Node id="141457" />The young man looked at him, took a step or two farther on, and said
over his shoulder, 'Is what yours?<Node id="141560" />'<Node id="141561" />

<Node id="141563" />Angus ran a few feet along his side of the hedge and said, 'What you've
just picked up.<Node id="141650" /> <Node id="141651" />If it's a funny looking stone, it's mine.<Node id="141692" />'<Node id="141693" />

<Node id="141695" />'<Node id="141696" />Is it really?<Node id="141709" />' <Node id="141711" />the stranger said.<Node id="141729" /> '<Node id="141731" />And why did you put it there?<Node id="141760" />'<Node id="141761" />

<Node id="141763" />'<Node id="141764" />Never mind about all that,' Sheldrake said impatiently.<Node id="141819" /> '<Node id="141821" />Just hand it
over, will you?<Node id="141849" />'<Node id="141850" />

<Node id="141852" />The young man began to walk slowly on, and Angus, tripping over roots
and stones every other second, kept pace with him, cursing aloud.<Node id="141987" />

<Node id="141989" />'<Node id="141990" />I ask you,' the stranger said to the sky, 'what would _you_ think?<Node id="142056" /> <Node id="142057" />I
pick a--something--from a hedge and am vociferously told that it belongs
to _him_'--he threw a disagreeable glance at Sheldrake.<Node id="142187" /> '<Node id="142189" />And you, I
suppose,' he said bitterly, 'were looking for it?<Node id="142249" />'<Node id="142250" />

<Node id="142252" />'<Node id="142253" />I had been,' Angus said, almost falling once more.<Node id="142303" /> '<Node id="142305" />I had only just sat
down.<Node id="142330" />'<Node id="142331" />

<Node id="142333" />'<Node id="142334" />Well, if you will take a rest in the middle of pitch and toss--' the
young man flung over.<Node id="142424" /> '<Node id="142426" />If it's yours how did it get to the top of the
hedge?<Node id="142479" />'<Node id="142480" />

<Node id="142482" />'<Node id="142483" />My wife threw it there from a car,' Sheldrake answered incoherently as
they reached the bank of the high road.<Node id="142593" />

<Node id="142595" />'<Node id="142596" />And then went away, car and all,' the stranger said looking at the
empty road.<Node id="142674" /> '<Node id="142676" />Family happiness.<Node id="142693" /> <Node id="142694" />Is marriage a success?<Node id="142716" />'<Node id="142717" />

<Node id="142719" />'<Node id="142720" />Don't be a damned idiot,' Angus snapped.<Node id="142760" /> '<Node id="142762" />Give me that stone at once.<Node id="142789" />'<Node id="142790" />

<Node id="142792" />The stranger pondered.<Node id="142814" /> '<Node id="142816" />I half-believe you,' he said, 'but only half.<Node id="142861" />
<Node id="142862" />And anyhow I may tell you I dislike nothing so much as to be called Hi.<Node id="142933" />
<Node id="142934" />I don't mind calling myself I, though of course--yes, I know what you're
going to say--there's no proof of it.<Node id="143044" /> <Node id="143045" />It's a convenience elevated into a
philosophy--yes, I agree.<Node id="143105" /> <Node id="143106" />But even so I don't like strangers using what
is, so to speak, my own pet name for myself.<Node id="143196" /> <Node id="143197" />And still more do I dislike
their aspirating it.<Node id="143245" /> <Node id="143246" />An aspirate so generously bestowed is almost
snobbish.<Node id="143300" /> <Node id="143301" />I don't say--'<Node id="143315" />

<Node id="143317" />'<Node id="143318" />Will you give me that stone?<Node id="143346" />' <Node id="143348" />Sheldrake shouted.<Node id="143366" />

<Node id="143368" />'<Node id="143369" />If you had asked me politely,' the young man went on gravely, 'I
probably should--more out of surprise than conviction.<Node id="143488" /> <Node id="143489" />Holy awe and so
on.<Node id="143508" /> <Node id="143509" />But as it is--no.<Node id="143526" /> <Node id="143527" />However, if it's yours, you shall have it.<Node id="143569" /> <Node id="143570" />My
name is Oliver Doncaster, and I am staying for a few weeks at Mrs.
Pentridge's in the village over there.<Node id="143678" /> <Node id="143679" />I am now going there to tea.<Node id="143707" />
_<Node id="143709" />After_ tea'--he looked at his watch--'a quarter to five say, about six,
if you will call and convince me you shall have your stone.<Node id="143840" /> <Node id="143841" />What is your
name--besides Hi, which is, I suppose, generic?<Node id="143901" />'<Node id="143902" />

<Node id="143904" />Angus tried to pull himself together; he felt such a fool wrangling
through a hedge.<Node id="143988" /> <Node id="143989" />Besides he was not finally certain that this fellow had
the stone.<Node id="144055" /> '<Node id="144057" />I beg your pardon if I was rude,' he said, 'but it was all
so sudden....<Node id="144129" />'<Node id="144130" />

<Node id="144132" />'<Node id="144133" />Very sudden,' Doncaster agreed politely.<Node id="144173" />

<Node id="144175" />'... <Node id="144180" />and I was so anxious to stop you, that I just called out....<Node id="144240" /> <Node id="144241" />If
you would let me see what it was you took out of the hedge....<Node id="144306" />'<Node id="144307" />

<Node id="144309" />'<Node id="144310" />It was,' the other allowed, 'a stone.<Node id="144347" /> <Node id="144348" />It just happened to catch my
eye.<Node id="144381" /> <Node id="144382" />After six I shall be delighted to let it catch yours.<Node id="144435" /> <Node id="144436" />Never mind
about your name if you'd rather keep it dark.<Node id="144492" /> <Node id="144493" />In about an hour or so
then?<Node id="144521" /> <Node id="144522" />So pleased to have--well, this is hardly a meeting, is it?<Node id="144580" />--<Node id="144582" />heard
from you.<Node id="144597" /> <Node id="144598" />Good-bye, good-bye.<Node id="144617" />' <Node id="144619" />He waved his hand gracefully and went off
along the footpath which here turned to the left and took him to a gate
half-way along the field.<Node id="144758" /> <Node id="144759" />By the time Angus had got to the bottom of the
bank he had come into the road, passed across it, and disappeared down a
side lane.<Node id="144889" />

<Node id="144891" />At tea he examined his find.<Node id="144919" /> <Node id="144920" />It seemed dull enough indoors, though the
colour was pure and the markings curious, but it lacked something of the
golden light with which it had seemed to shine in the afternoon sun.<Node id="145103" /> <Node id="145104" />A
little disappointed he went up to his bedroom and paused on the way at
another door.<Node id="145190" />

<Node id="145192" />'<Node id="145193" />Hallo,' he said, 'may I come in?<Node id="145225" />'<Node id="145226" />

<Node id="145228" />In the bed in this room lay Mrs. Pentridge's mother, Mrs. Ferguson, who
had been paralyzed from the waist downward for the last year.<Node id="145361" /> <Node id="145362" />Opinion
in the house was silently divided whether it would have been better for
her to be taken altogether or not.<Node id="145476" /> <Node id="145477" />Mr. Pentridge thought it would be
a merciful release for her.<Node id="145538" /> <Node id="145539" />Mrs. Pentridge thought it was a merciful
blessing that she had been so far spared.<Node id="145621" /> <Node id="145622" />Mrs. Ferguson disguised her
own opinion, if she had one, and concentrated her energies on making the
most of what visitors and what talk she could still have.<Node id="145780" /> <Node id="145781" />Doncaster had
fallen into what he felt to be a ridiculous habit of showing her his
day's work after tea, and was even, half-seriously, trying to teach her
his own prejudices about art; not that he allowed himself to call them
that.<Node id="146012" /> <Node id="146013" />Mrs. Pentridge, who was also in the room, examining pillow-cases,
welcomed him as warmly as her mother.<Node id="146116" />

<Node id="146118" />'<Node id="146119" />Did you get a nice view, Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="146158" />' <Node id="146160" />she asked.<Node id="146170" />

<Node id="146172" />He sat down smiling.<Node id="146192" /> '<Node id="146194" />A very pretty bit of work,' he said.<Node id="146230" /> '<Node id="146232" />No, Mrs.
Ferguson, I don't mean mine--I mean the thing I was trying to do.<Node id="146306" /> <Node id="146307" />But I
had to alter one branch.<Node id="146337" /> <Node id="146338" />I couldn't somehow find out exactly what spot
nature meant me to stand at.<Node id="146412" /> <Node id="146413" />Now look there----' He held out the sketch
and Mrs. Ferguson stared at it while he expatiated.<Node id="146507" /> <Node id="146508" />Mrs. Pentridge went
on with her pillow-cases.<Node id="146553" /> <Node id="146554" />When at last he rose--'O by the way,' he said,
'I'm expecting a man in a few minutes to talk about something I found.<Node id="146671" />
<Node id="146672" />Look, did you ever see a stone like that?<Node id="146713" />' <Node id="146715" />He passed it over to Mrs.
Ferguson.<Node id="146750" /> '<Node id="146752" />Look at the colour, isn't it exquisite?<Node id="146791" />'<Node id="146792" />

<Node id="146794" />'<Node id="146795" />What is it?<Node id="146806" />' <Node id="146808" />the old lady asked.<Node id="146827" />

<Node id="146829" />'<Node id="146830" />Lord knows,' said Oliver.<Node id="146855" /> '<Node id="146857" />I should like it to be chrysoprase, but I
don't suppose it is.<Node id="146919" /> <Node id="146920" />The Urim and Thummim perhaps.<Node id="146949" />'<Node id="146950" />

<Node id="146952" />'<Node id="146953" />That was what the high priest had on his breast-plate,' Mrs. Ferguson
said, looking at the Bible that lay by her bedside.<Node id="147074" /> '<Node id="147076" />I remember that
well enough.<Node id="147104" />'<Node id="147105" />

<Node id="147107" />'<Node id="147108" />I'm sure you do,' Oliver said smiling.<Node id="147146" />

<Node id="147148" />'<Node id="147149" />I was little enough when I heard about them,' Mrs. Ferguson went on.<Node id="147217" />
'<Node id="147219" />At the Sunday school it was.<Node id="147247" /> <Node id="147248" />I remember it because I learned them the
Sunday before I went to the treat for the first time.<Node id="147342" /> <Node id="147343" />Urim and Thummim,
that was it.<Node id="147373" /> <Node id="147374" />I remember Susie Bright pretending to look for them all the
way home in the ditch.<Node id="147456" /> <Node id="147457" />O I do wish I could run now as well as I could
then.<Node id="147509" />'<Node id="147510" />

<Node id="147512" />Mr.<Node id="147515" /> <Node id="147516" />Sheldrake's knock at the door below passed unnoticed.<Node id="147569" /> <Node id="147570" />For Mrs.
Pentridge had dropped her pillow-cases, and with staring eyes was
watching her mother struggling up in bed.<Node id="147686" /> <Node id="147687" />She sat up, she gasped and
gazed, her hands drooped and waved in front of her.<Node id="147765" /> <Node id="147766" />She began to shift
round; oblivious of Oliver's presence she felt for the side of the bed
and began to slip her feet over it.<Node id="147891" /> '<Node id="147893" />Mother,' shrieked Mrs. Pentridge
and flew to one side as Oliver leapt to the other.<Node id="147976" /> <Node id="147977" />Mrs. Ferguson,
panting with surprise and exertion, came slowly to her feet, and
holding on to her two supporters, took a step or two forward.<Node id="148118" />

<Node id="148120" />'<Node id="148121" />I'm all right,' she gasped, released Oliver, took another step, 'quite
all right,' and let go of her daughter.<Node id="148231" /> '<Node id="148233" />I think,' she added, 'I must be
feeling a bit better to-day.<Node id="148293" />'<Node id="148294" />

<Node id="148296" />There was a stupendous silence.<Node id="148327" /> <Node id="148328" />Mr. Sheldrake knocked again at the
front door.<Node id="148374" />




<Node id="148379" />CHAPTER VI<Node id="148389" />

<Node id="148391" />THE PROBLEM OF TIME<Node id="148410" />


<Node id="148413" />Sir Giles lay back in a chair and grinned at Professor Palliser.<Node id="148477" /> '<Node id="148479" />Well,'
he said, 'we've spent twenty-four hours on it and here's the result.<Node id="148554" />' <Node id="148556" />He
read from a paper.<Node id="148577" />

    <Node id="148583" />'1. <Node id="148587" />It is of no known substance.<Node id="148615" />

     <Node id="148622" />2. <Node id="148625" />It answers to no re-agents.<Node id="148652" />

     <Node id="148659" />3. <Node id="148662" />It can be multiplied by division without diminution of the
     original.<Node id="148735" />

     <Node id="148742" />4. <Node id="148745" />It can move and cause movement from point to point, without
     leaving any consciousness of passage through intervening space.<Node id="148873" />

     <Node id="148880" />5. <Node id="148883" />It can cause disappearance--possibly in time.<Node id="148928" />'<Node id="148929" />

<Node id="148931" />'<Node id="148932" />Certainly in time,' Palliser said, but Sir Giles shook his head.<Node id="148996" />

<Node id="148998" />'<Node id="148999" />Only possibly,' he answered, 'we don't know that your bright young
pathological specimen has gone back in time; we only know he isn't here
and the Stone is.<Node id="149155" /> <Node id="149156" />I thought you told a very good story this morning to
that mother of his.<Node id="149228" />'<Node id="149229" />

<Node id="149231" />'<Node id="149232" />I don't like it,' Palliser answered seriously.<Node id="149278" /> '<Node id="149280" />It's all very
disturbing.<Node id="149305" /> <Node id="149306" />I suppose the police will be coming here soon.<Node id="149352" />'<Node id="149353" />

<Node id="149355" />'<Node id="149356" />I should think certainly,' Sir Giles agreed.<Node id="149400" /> '<Node id="149402" />But I heard him say good
night.<Node id="149433" /> <Node id="149434" />And there's no reason why you should murder him--I suppose there
isn't?<Node id="149505" />--<Node id="149507" />and no way for you to do it.<Node id="149535" /> <Node id="149536" />So I can't see that you're likely
to be troubled seriously.<Node id="149595" /> <Node id="149596" />And anyhow they haven't got a body nor any
trace of one.<Node id="149652" /> <Node id="149653" />Let's get on with the inquiry.<Node id="149683" />'<Node id="149684" />

<Node id="149686" />'<Node id="149687" />I expect you're right,' the Professor said.<Node id="149730" /> '<Node id="149732" />What do you think we ought
to do next?<Node id="149770" />'<Node id="149771" />

<Node id="149773" />Sir Giles leaned forward.<Node id="149798" /> '<Node id="149800" />If this assistant of yours has moved in
time,' he said, 'if he has gone back, wherever he's gone to, I suppose
he might have gone forward instead?<Node id="149946" />'<Node id="149947" />

<Node id="149949" />'<Node id="149950" />I suppose so,' Palliser assented slowly.<Node id="149990" />

<Node id="149992" />'<Node id="149993" />Then that seems to be the next thing,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="150047" /> '<Node id="150049" />But that I
think we shall have to do ourselves.<Node id="150096" /> <Node id="150097" />We can't run any risk of giving too
much away.<Node id="150143" /> <Node id="150144" />And, I don't see any chance of being permanently lost there
because the future must be the present some time.<Node id="150253" />'<Node id="150254" />

<Node id="150256" />'<Node id="150257" />All the same, I shouldn't go too far at first,' Palliser suggested.<Node id="150324" /> '<Node id="150326" />A
quarter of an hour, say.<Node id="150352" />'<Node id="150353" />

<Node id="150355" />Sir Giles took a Stone from the table, and was about to speak when
Palliser suddenly went on.<Node id="150448" /> '<Node id="150450" />Look here, Tumulty, if it worked that way,
it wouldn't be a certainty, would it?<Node id="150530" /> <Node id="150531" />Supposing I project myself an hour
forward and find I'm sitting in this room--and then suppose I return
to the present and go to my bedroom and have myself locked in for two
hours, say, how can I be doing what I saw myself doing?<Node id="150760" /> <Node id="150761" />And the shorter
the time the more chance of proving it wrong.<Node id="150822" /> <Node id="150823" />In six days anything might
happen, but in six minutes...<Node id="150879" />'<Node id="150880" />

<Node id="150882" />Sir Giles brooded.<Node id="150900" /> '<Node id="150902" />You probably wouldn't remember,' he pointed out.<Node id="150950" />
'<Node id="150952" />But I like the idea of your defying the future, Palliser.<Node id="151009" /> <Node id="151010" />Try it and
see.<Node id="151025" />' <Node id="151027" />Palliser's tall lean form quivered with excitement.<Node id="151078" /> '<Node id="151080" />It would snap
the chain,' he said.<Node id="151114" /> '<Node id="151116" />We should know we weren't the mere mechanisms of
Fate.<Node id="151170" /> <Node id="151171" />We should be free.<Node id="151189" />'<Node id="151190" />

<Node id="151192" />'<Node id="151193" />I sometimes think,' Sir Giles answered reflectively, 'that I'm the only
real scientist in this whole crawling hotbed of vermin called England.<Node id="151335" />
<Node id="151336" />There isn't one of all of you that doesn't cuddle some fantastic desire
in his heart, and snivel over every chance of letting it out for an
hour's toddle.<Node id="151490" /> <Node id="151491" />Do be intelligent, Palliser.<Node id="151519" /> <Node id="151520" />How can any damned happening
break the chain of happenings?<Node id="151579" /> <Node id="151580" />Why do you want to be free?<Node id="151607" /> <Node id="151608" />What good
could you do if you were free?<Node id="151648" />'<Node id="151649" />

<Node id="151651" />'<Node id="151652" />If a man can defeat the result of all the past,' the Professor said,
'if he can know what is to be and cause that it shall not be----'<Node id="151786" />

<Node id="151788" />'<Node id="151789" />O you're drunk,' said Sir Giles frankly.<Node id="151829" /> '<Node id="151831" />You're drunk with your own
romantic gin-and-bitters.<Node id="151883" /> <Node id="151884" />If you're going to be sitting here in an
hour's time you're going to be, even if this bit of prehistoric slime
has to bump you on your crazy noddle and shove you into a chair all on
its own.<Node id="152074" /> <Node id="152075" />But try it, try it and see.<Node id="152102" />'<Node id="152103" />

<Node id="152105" />'<Node id="152106" />Well, you try it too,' Palliser said sullenly.<Node id="152152" /> '<Node id="152154" />I'm going to keep you
under my eye, Tumulty.<Node id="152198" /> <Node id="152199" />None of your kidnapping games for me.<Node id="152236" />'<Node id="152237" />

<Node id="152239" />'<Node id="152240" />You romantics are always so suspicious,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="152296" /> '<Node id="152298" />But for once
I don't mind.<Node id="152324" /> <Node id="152325" />Let's try it together.<Node id="152347" /> <Node id="152348" />Where's the Crown?<Node id="152366" />'<Node id="152367" />

<Node id="152369" />Palliser took it out of the old safe in which it had rested all night,
and sat down beside Tumulty.<Node id="152468" /> '<Node id="152470" />How long do we make it?<Node id="152493" />' <Node id="152495" />he asked.<Node id="152504" /> '<Node id="152506" />Half
an hour?<Node id="152519" />'<Node id="152520" />

<Node id="152522" />'<Node id="152523" />Good enough,' Sir Giles answered.<Node id="152556" /> '<Node id="152558" />You locked the door?<Node id="152578" /> <Node id="152579" />Right.<Node id="152585" />
<Node id="152586" />Now--where's the clock?<Node id="152609" /> <Node id="152610" />Half-past eleven.<Node id="152627" /> <Node id="152628" />Wait.<Node id="152633" /> <Node id="152634" />Let me write it on a
bit of paper--so, and put that on the table.<Node id="152699" /> <Node id="152700" />What's the formula?<Node id="152719" />'<Node id="152720" />

<Node id="152722" />'<Node id="152723" />To be as we shall be at twelve o'clock, I suppose,' Palliser said, and
the two--Palliser wearing the Crown, Sir Giles clutching the
Stone--framed the wish in their minds.<Node id="152893" />

<Node id="152895" />'... <Node id="152900" />though I don't suppose I can tell you anything new,' Palliser
ended, looking at the police inspector.<Node id="153001" />

<Node id="153003" />Sir Giles looked round over his shoulder--he was standing by the
window--but he was only half-attending.<Node id="153107" /> <Node id="153108" />Had or had not the experiment
succeeded?<Node id="153148" /> <Node id="153149" />He couldn't remember a thing out of the ordinary.<Node id="153198" /> <Node id="153199" />He had sat
with Palliser for what seemed a long time--but which the clock had shown
to be only ten minutes, and had been vaguely conscious of a rather sick
feeling somewhere.<Node id="153373" /> <Node id="153374" />And then they had looked at one another and Palliser
had abruptly said, 'Well?<Node id="153452" />' <Node id="153454" />He had stirred and stood up, looked at the
slip of paper with '11.30' written on it, looked at the clock which
marked twenty to twelve, looked back at Palliser, and said with some
irritation, 'God blast the whole damned thing to hell, I don't know.<Node id="153702" />'<Node id="153703" />

<Node id="153705" />'<Node id="153706" />What do you mean?<Node id="153723" />' <Node id="153725" />or something like it, Palliser had asked.<Node id="153766" /> <Node id="153767" />The
picture was becoming fainter, but roughly he could still fill it in.<Node id="153839" />
<Node id="153840" />Every minute made all that had happened in that half hour more of a
memory; but had it happened at all or was it memory to begin with?<Node id="153974" />
<Node id="153975" />And was what was happening now actually happening or was it merely
foresight?<Node id="154052" />

<Node id="154054" />Sir Giles in a burst of anger and something remarkably like alarm,
realized that he didn't know.<Node id="154150" />

<Node id="154152" />He remembered the knocking, the caretaker, the entrance of the
inspector to whom Palliser was talking--very well the Professor
was doing, Sir Giles thought, only he probably hadn't realized the
difficulty; he wouldn't, not with that kind of cancer-eaten sponge he
called an intellect.<Node id="154436" /> '<Node id="154438" />But I _remember_,' Tumulty thought impatiently.<Node id="154485" />
'<Node id="154487" />How the hell could I remember if it hadn't happened?<Node id="154539" /> <Node id="154540" />There'd be nothing
to remember.<Node id="154571" />' <Node id="154573" />He plunged deeper.<Node id="154591" /> '<Node id="154593" />But at twelve I should remember.<Node id="154625" /> <Node id="154626" />Then
if it's come off--I remember what hasn't happened.<Node id="154681" /> <Node id="154682" />I'm in a delusion.<Node id="154700" />
<Node id="154701" />I'm mad.<Node id="154709" /> <Node id="154710" />Nonsense.<Node id="154719" /> <Node id="154720" />I'm in the twelve state of consciousness.<Node id="154761" /> <Node id="154762" />But the
twelve state couldn't be unless the eleven to twelve state had been.<Node id="154838" /> <Node id="154839" />Am
I here or am I sitting in that blasted chair of Palliser's knowing it
from outside time?<Node id="154930" />'<Node id="154931" />

<Node id="154933" />He had a feeling that there was another corollary just round the corner
of his mind and strained to find it.<Node id="155041" /> <Node id="155042" />But it avoided him for the moment.<Node id="155076" />
<Node id="155077" />He looked over his shoulder to find that the inspector was going, and as
soon as the departure was achieved rushed across the room to Palliser.<Node id="155220" />
'<Node id="155222" />Now,' he said, 'what _has_ happened?<Node id="155258" /> <Node id="155259" />O never mind about your fly-blown
policeman.<Node id="155303" /> _<Node id="155305" />What has happened?<Node id="155323" />_'<Node id="155325" />

<Node id="155327" />'<Node id="155328" />Nothing has happened,' Palliser said staring.<Node id="155373" /> '<Node id="155375" />It evidently doesn't
work in the future.<Node id="155415" />'<Node id="155416" />

<Node id="155418" />'<Node id="155419" />You seem jolly sure about it,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="155465" /> '<Node id="155467" />How do you _know_?<Node id="155485" /> <Node id="155486" />You
wanted to be as you would be at twelve, didn't you?<Node id="155541" /> <Node id="155542" />Well, how do you
know you're not?<Node id="155575" /> <Node id="155576" />You seem to remember, I know; so do I.'<Node id="155615" />

<Node id="155617" />'<Node id="155618" />Well then,' Palliser argued--'Yes, I see what you mean.<Node id="155673" /> <Node id="155674" />This is
merely knowledge--premature knowledge?<Node id="155720" /> <Node id="155721" />Umph.<Node id="155726" /> <Node id="155727" />Well, let's return to
eleven-thirty.<Node id="155763" />' <Node id="155765" />He took a step towards the safe, but Sir Giles caught
him by the wrist.<Node id="155836" /> '<Node id="155838" />Don't do that, you fool,' he said.<Node id="155872" /> '<Node id="155874" />Why the hell
didn't I see it before?<Node id="155910" /> <Node id="155911" />If you once go back, you'll bind yourself to go
on doing the same thing--you _must_.<Node id="155995" />'<Node id="155996" />

<Node id="155998" />Palliser sat down abruptly and the two looked at each other.<Node id="156058" /> '<Node id="156060" />But you
said the present would be bound to become the future,' he objected.<Node id="156135" />

<Node id="156137" />'<Node id="156138" />I know I did,' Sir Giles almost howled at him.<Node id="156184" /> '<Node id="156186" />But don't you see, you
fool, that the action of return must be made at the starting-point?<Node id="156276" />
<Node id="156277" />That's why your oyster-stomached helot vanished; that's the trick that's
caught you now.<Node id="156365" /> <Node id="156366" />I won't be caught; there must be a way out and I'll find
it.<Node id="156426" />'<Node id="156427" />

<Node id="156429" />'<Node id="156430" />Look here, Tumulty,' Palliser said, 'let's keep calm and think it out.<Node id="156500" />
<Node id="156501" />What do you mean by the action of return being made at the
starting-point?<Node id="156575" />'<Node id="156576" />

<Node id="156578" />'<Node id="156579" />O God,' Sir Giles moaned, 'to be fastened to a man who doesn't know
how to ask his mother for milk!<Node id="156678" /> <Node id="156679" />I mean that you must condition your
experiment from without and not from within; you must define your
movement before you make it or your definition will be controlled by it.<Node id="156853" />
<Node id="156854" />You can say _I will go and return in such and such a manner_, but if you
only say _I will go_ your return is ruled by sequence.<Node id="156981" /> <Node id="156982" />Can't you think,
Palliser?<Node id="157008" />'<Node id="157009" />

<Node id="157011" />'<Node id="157012" />Then we _are_ in the future?<Node id="157040" />' <Node id="157042" />Palliser said, 'and we can't go back to
live that half-hour?<Node id="157102" /> <Node id="157103" />Well, does it very much matter?<Node id="157134" />'<Node id="157135" />

<Node id="157137" />'<Node id="157138" />If we are,' Sir Giles said, 'we--O it's no good trying to explain to
you.<Node id="157211" />' <Node id="157213" />He began to walk about and then went back to the chair in which he
had been sitting originally and stared at it.<Node id="157325" /> '<Node id="157327" />Now am I there?<Node id="157342" />' <Node id="157344" />he asked
grimly, 'or am I here?<Node id="157375" />'<Node id="157376" />

<Node id="157378" />There was a silence of some minutes.<Node id="157414" /> <Node id="157415" />Then Palliser said again, 'I still
can't see why you're so excited.<Node id="157482" /> <Node id="157483" />That half-hour wasn't of any
importance, surely?<Node id="157531" />'<Node id="157532" />

<Node id="157534" />Sir Giles, having reached his limit of exasperation, became
unexpectedly gentle.<Node id="157614" /> <Node id="157615" />He went back to Palliser and said almost sweetly,
'Well, don't worry over it, don't hurt your brain, but just try and
follow.<Node id="157740" /> <Node id="157741" />If this is a forecast in consciousness, that consciousness is,
so to speak, housed somewhere.<Node id="157834" /> <Node id="157835" />And it's housed in your body.<Node id="157864" /> <Node id="157865" />And where's
your body?<Node id="157887" /> <Node id="157888" />And how do you get your mind-time and your body-time to
agree?<Node id="157950" />'<Node id="157951" />

<Node id="157953" />'<Node id="157954" />My body is here,' Palliser said, patting it.<Node id="157998" />

<Node id="158000" />'<Node id="158001" />O no,' Sir Giles said, still sweetly.<Node id="158038" /> '<Node id="158040" />At least perhaps it is and
perhaps it isn't.<Node id="158084" /> <Node id="158085" />Perhaps all this is occupying a millionth part of a
second and we're still sitting there.<Node id="158174" />'<Node id="158175" />

<Node id="158177" />'<Node id="158178" />But Pondon disappeared?<Node id="158201" />' <Node id="158203" />Palliser objected, 'into his past, I suppose?<Node id="158248" />
<Node id="158249" />Mayn't we have disappeared into our future?<Node id="158292" />'<Node id="158293" />

<Node id="158295" />'<Node id="158296" />I hope we have,' Sir Giles assented.<Node id="158332" /> '<Node id="158334" />But we seem to remember--or to
know--what happened, don't we?<Node id="158395" /> <Node id="158396" />We seem to know that we talked and the
police came and so on?<Node id="158457" /> <Node id="158458" />Did it happen or has it got to happen or hasn't
it happened and will it never happen?<Node id="158543" /> <Node id="158544" />If we will to return we seem to
me--but of course I'm a little child crooning on your knee--to be in a
constant succession of the same period.<Node id="158686" /> <Node id="158687" />And if we don't?<Node id="158703" />'<Node id="158704" />

<Node id="158706" />'<Node id="158707" />Well, we go on,' the Professor said.<Node id="158743" />

<Node id="158745" />'<Node id="158746" />Till we become conscious of death?<Node id="158780" />' <Node id="158782" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="158798" /> '<Node id="158800" />And then what
happens?<Node id="158822" /> <Node id="158823" />Till these apparent bodies die and corrupt and our minds return
to our real bodies and live it again--is that the truth?<Node id="158943" /> <Node id="158944" />Years and years
and years and all in less than a second and all to be repeated--do you
like it, Palliser?<Node id="159049" />'<Node id="159050" />

<Node id="159052" />'<Node id="159053" />But Pondon disappeared,' the Professor said again.<Node id="159103" />

<Node id="159105" />'<Node id="159106" />You keep on repeating that,' Sir Giles told him.<Node id="159154" /> '<Node id="159156" />Don't you see, you
cow, that the conditions may be different?<Node id="159217" /> <Node id="159218" />Whatever the past is, it has
been in everyone's knowledge; whatever the future is it hasn't.<Node id="159310" />'<Node id="159311" />

<Node id="159313" />'<Node id="159314" />What do you propose to do about it, anyhow?<Node id="159357" />' <Node id="159359" />the Professor asked.<Node id="159379" />

<Node id="159381" />Sir Giles considered.<Node id="159402" /> '<Node id="159404" />I propose to think over it for a few days,' he
said, 'and see if I can think of any formula to find out, first where
that assistant of yours is and secondly where we are.<Node id="159574" /> <Node id="159575" />Also to see if
Whitehall is doing anything, because I'm not going to be taken by
surprise by _them_, not under present conditions.<Node id="159705" /> <Node id="159706" />So I shall go back to
London this afternoon.<Node id="159750" />'<Node id="159751" />

<Node id="159753" />All the way to Euston--he didn't want to use the Stone again at the
moment--Tumulty brooded over the problem that confronted him.<Node id="159882" /> <Node id="159883" />He devised
several formul� for getting into touch with the unfortunate Mr. Pondon;
the most obvious experiment--that of willing him back--had been tried by
himself and the Professor on the previous evening without success.<Node id="160105" /> <Node id="160106" />It
seemed that the Stone could not be used to control others; its action
was effective only over the action of whoever held it.<Node id="160233" /> <Node id="160234" />Sir Giles
regretted this rather keenly; the possibility of disarranging other
people's lives had appeared to him a desirable means of experiment,
since he was on the whole reluctant to conduct experiments on himself.<Node id="160450" />
<Node id="160451" />That state of being which lies between mysticism, madness, and
romanticism, had always been his chosen field, but it was a field in
which few suitable subjects grew.<Node id="160616" /> <Node id="160617" />He found it impossible not to desire
to be able to dispose of objectionable people by removing them to some
past state of being, and he almost sent a telegram to Palliser urging
him to acquaint Mrs. Pondon and the police with the facts of the case
and to inquire whether the police 'in the execution of their duty' would
be bound to follow the vanished assistant to the day before yesterday.<Node id="161008" />
<Node id="161009" />Pondon had certainly gone of his own free will, even if his superior had
refrained from explaining the possibilities clearly enough.<Node id="161141" /> <Node id="161142" />However,
Pondon could wait a few days.<Node id="161180" /> <Node id="161181" />That morning, Sir Giles had noticed in
their short interview, he had cut himself while shaving; it afforded
Tumulty a certain pleasure to think of that small cut being repeated
again and again until he himself had time, inclination, and knowledge to
interfere.<Node id="161441" /> <Node id="161442" />But the other problem worried him more considerably.<Node id="161494" /> <Node id="161495" />That
missing half hour haunted him; had he lived through it or had he not,
and if he had not could even the Stone release him from the necessity of
doing so?<Node id="161652" />

<Node id="161654" />He began to wonder if the Stone could help him, but he didn't see how,
unless it could present thoughts to his mind--or to other people's.<Node id="161792" /> <Node id="161793" />If
there was someone he could trust to tell him what could be learnt from
such a trial of the Stone?<Node id="161893" /> <Node id="161894" />He thought of Lord Arglay, a trained and
detached, and not unsympathetic, mind.<Node id="161973" /> <Node id="161974" />Palliser was no good because
Palliser was mixed up with it.<Node id="162033" /> <Node id="162034" />And you couldn't go to everyone asking
them to help you look for half an hour you had mislaid.<Node id="162128" /> <Node id="162129" />Also Arglay
would know if Whitehall were moving--not that he minded very much if it
were.<Node id="162218" />

<Node id="162220" />At Euston he took a taxi to the Chief Justice's.<Node id="162268" />

<Node id="162270" />Lord Arglay's Saturday afternoon therefore broke suddenly into activity.<Node id="162342" />
<Node id="162343" />Some time after tea, while he was playing with the idea of bringing
_Organic Law_ into the Stone's sphere of activity, though he felt
certain the Hajji would disapprove of any such use, he was startled by
the announcement that Mrs. Sheldrake had called.<Node id="162596" /> '<Node id="162598" />Miss Burnett is with
her, sir,' the maid added.<Node id="162645" />

<Node id="162647" />'<Node id="162648" />Now what on earth,' Lord Arglay said as he went to the drawing-room,
'is Chloe doing with Mrs. Sheldrake?<Node id="162753" /> <Node id="162754" />How did she get hold of her, I
wonder?<Node id="162792" /> <Node id="162793" />and has she brought her here to be instructed or to be
frightened?<Node id="162859" />'<Node id="162860" />

<Node id="162862" />It soon appeared however that if anyone were frightened it was Chloe
herself.<Node id="162939" /> <Node id="162940" />Mrs. Sheldrake took the conversation into her own hands, with a
brief explanation of her connection with the Stone and a light reference
to the fact that it had been, for the moment, mislaid.<Node id="163131" /> <Node id="163132" />She wanted to
know, since Miss Burnett had mentioned Lord Arglay several times,
whether he claimed any rights in the Stone.<Node id="163255" />

<Node id="163257" />'<Node id="163258" />Not in that particular Type,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="163305" />

<Node id="163307" />'<Node id="163308" />Type, Lord Arglay?<Node id="163326" />' <Node id="163328" />Cecilia asked.<Node id="163342" /> '<Node id="163344" />How do you mean--Type?<Node id="163366" />'<Node id="163367" />

<Node id="163369" />'<Node id="163370" />The position is a little obscure,' the Chief Justice said, considering
rapidly Mrs. Sheldrake's appearance and manner, Mr. Sheldrake's riches
and position (which he had looked up), and the desirability of subduing
them both without antagonism.<Node id="163613" /> '<Node id="163615" />I say Type because the Stones which
exist--and there are several--are apparently derivations from one
Original, though (and perhaps therefore) possessed of the same powers.<Node id="163787" />
<Node id="163788" />But how far they are to be regarded as being identical with it, for
proprietary reasons, I cannot at the moment say.<Node id="163904" /> <Node id="163905" />Nor in whom the title
to the property inheres.<Node id="163951" /> <Node id="163952" />I may add that certain foreign representatives
are deeply interested, and the Government is observing matters.<Node id="164062" /> <Node id="164063" />I think
that in the present situation your husband should preserve the utmost
secrecy and caution.<Node id="164161" /> <Node id="164162" />His title appears to me uncertain, both so far as
the acquisition of his Type is concerned and in the relation of that
Type to the Original.<Node id="164302" />'<Node id="164303" />

<Node id="164305" />He delivered this with occasional pauses for meditation and with a
slight pomposity which he put on at necessary moments.<Node id="164426" /> <Node id="164427" />Mrs. Sheldrake, a
little impressed, nevertheless appeared to receive it with frigidity.<Node id="164514" />

<Node id="164516" />'<Node id="164517" />But Lord Arglay,' she said, 'we can't be expected to sit quiet while
other people use our property in order to ruin our companies.<Node id="164647" /> <Node id="164648" />I am
thinking of the effect it may have on Atlantic Airways.<Node id="164708" /> <Node id="164709" />What is this
original you are talking about?<Node id="164753" />'<Node id="164754" />

<Node id="164756" />'<Node id="164757" />It is the centre of the derivations,' Lord Arglay said at random, but
ridiculously enough the phrase in Chloe's mind suddenly connected itself
with 'the End of Desire.<Node id="164924" />' <Node id="164926" />The chance and romantic words came to her like
a gospel, none the less emotionally powerful that at the moment she
didn't understand it.<Node id="165062" /> <Node id="165063" />What were the derivations?<Node id="165089" /> <Node id="165090" />She had a vague feeling
that the sentence suggested Lord Arglay himself as the centre though she
knew he would have been the first to mock at the ascription.<Node id="165247" /> <Node id="165248" />But there
was certainly something in them that referred, if not to him, then to
something connected with him.<Node id="165357" /> <Node id="165358" />He was walking on some firm pavement,
where she wanted to be walking too.<Node id="165431" />

<Node id="165433" />She came back to hear Mrs. Sheldrake end a sentence--'opinion on it.<Node id="165501" />'<Node id="165502" />

<Node id="165504" />'<Node id="165505" />Madam,' Lord Arglay said, 'it must be clear to you that I can give no
opinion until a case is before the Court.<Node id="165616" /> <Node id="165617" />I am not a solicitor or a
barrister.<Node id="165653" /> <Node id="165654" />I am the Chief Justice.<Node id="165677" />'<Node id="165678" />

<Node id="165680" />'<Node id="165681" />But we must know what to _do_,' Mrs. Sheldrake said.<Node id="165733" /> '<Node id="165735" />Don't you even
know where the original, whatever it is, came from?<Node id="165801" />'<Node id="165802" />

<Node id="165804" />Lord Arglay suppressed a desire to offer her a pr�cis of the Hajji's
history of the Stone of Suleiman, and leaned forward.<Node id="165926" />

<Node id="165928" />'<Node id="165929" />Mrs.<Node id="165933" /> <Node id="165934" />Sheldrake,' he said, 'by the folly of my nephew you have come into
actual--if not legal--possession of a Type of a Stone which is said to
be regarded by millions as a very holy relic, and the ownership of which
may have the most important repercussions.<Node id="166187" /> <Node id="166188" />I beg you to act with great
care.<Node id="166221" /> <Node id="166222" />I venture to suggest that you should at least consider the
propriety of giving it into my care until more is known and decided.<Node id="166349" />
<Node id="166350" />It is, I know, an audacious proposal, but the seeming audacity is due
to the anxiety with which I regard the situation.<Node id="166469" /> <Node id="166470" />I am not speaking
casually.<Node id="166497" /> <Node id="166498" />I do not think it likely, but in certain remote yet not
impossible circumstances I can believe that even your life and your
husband's might be in danger.<Node id="166651" /> <Node id="166652" />Consult with him and believe me that this
warning is meant very, very seriously.<Node id="166732" />'<Node id="166733" />

<Node id="166735" />'<Node id="166736" />That,' he thought, 'ought to worry her.<Node id="166775" />' <Node id="166777" />She was staring at the ground
now, and he threw a side glance at Chloe, whose face reinforced his
words.<Node id="166881" />

<Node id="166883" />Cecilia felt baffled.<Node id="166904" /> <Node id="166905" />She saw nothing to do at the moment but to talk to
Angus and take other ways of finding out the mystery.<Node id="167009" /> <Node id="167010" />As she began to
shape a phrase of dubious farewell the door was thrown open and Sir
Giles Tumulty came in.<Node id="167116" /> <Node id="167117" />He nodded to Arglay and stared at the visitors.<Node id="167164" />

<Node id="167166" />'<Node id="167167" />Busy, Arglay?<Node id="167180" />' <Node id="167182" />he asked.<Node id="167191" /> '<Node id="167193" />I want to talk to you.<Node id="167215" />'<Node id="167216" />

<Node id="167218" />'<Node id="167219" />I want to talk to _you_,' the Chief Justice said, with something in his
voice that made Chloe look up suddenly and even distracted Cecilia, to
whom he turned.<Node id="167377" /> '<Node id="167379" />I can do no more for you now, Mrs. Sheldrake,' he
ended.<Node id="167435" />

<Node id="167437" />'<Node id="167438" />It's very unsatisfactory,' she complained.<Node id="167480" /> '<Node id="167482" />I almost think I had
better go to the Ambassador.<Node id="167531" /> <Node id="167532" />You see, we don't come under your
jurisdiction, if that's what you call it.<Node id="167607" /> <Node id="167608" />We belong to the States.<Node id="167632" />'<Node id="167633" />

<Node id="167635" />'<Node id="167636" />Quite,' Lord Arglay said, waiting for her to go.<Node id="167684" />

<Node id="167686" />'<Node id="167687" />After all someone must know to whom the Stone belongs, and who can or
can't sell it,' Cecilia went on.<Node id="167789" />

<Node id="167791" />'<Node id="167792" />Hallo,' Sir Giles said, 'have you got one too?<Node id="167838" /> <Node id="167839" />Is this yours, Arglay,
or is it Reginald's?<Node id="167882" /> <Node id="167883" />I hope you didn't overcharge for it.<Node id="167919" />'<Node id="167920" />

<Node id="167922" />Cecilia almost leaped at him.<Node id="167951" /> '<Node id="167953" />O,' she said, 'I'm afraid I don't know
your name, but can you tell me anything about this Stone?<Node id="168049" /> <Node id="168050" />It's all so
very mysterious.<Node id="168078" /> <Node id="168079" />We--my husband and I--bought it from a Mr. Montague,
and now we are told it's very doubtful whether he had the right to sell
it.<Node id="168207" />'<Node id="168208" />

<Node id="168210" />'<Node id="168211" />Of course he had the right,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="168255" /> '<Node id="168257" />I gave him one yesterday
morning.<Node id="168290" />'<Node id="168291" />

<Node id="168293" />'<Node id="168294" />Was it yours then to begin with?<Node id="168326" />' <Node id="168328" />Cecilia asked.<Node id="168342" />

<Node id="168344" />'<Node id="168345" />Certainly,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="168372" /> '<Node id="168374" />Does anyone deny it?<Node id="168394" />'<Node id="168395" />

<Node id="168397" />'<Node id="168398" />Yes,' Lord Arglay said, 'and you know they do.<Node id="168444" />'<Node id="168445" />

<Node id="168447" />'<Node id="168448" />O a set of religious maniacs,' Sir Giles tossed them aside.<Node id="168507" /> '<Node id="168509" />Do you,
Arglay?<Node id="168524" />'<Node id="168525" />

<Node id="168527" />The Chief Justice paused for a half second, then his training won.<Node id="168593" />

<Node id="168595" />'<Node id="168596" />No,' he said, 'I don't deny it for I don't know.<Node id="168644" /> <Node id="168645" />But I want to talk to
you about it, Tumulty, after this lady has gone.<Node id="168715" />' <Node id="168717" />He felt it was rude
but he couldn't help it.<Node id="168761" /> <Node id="168762" />A more urgent matter than Mrs. Sheldrake's
trouble was obsessing him.<Node id="168831" /> <Node id="168832" />That she had actually lost the Stone he had
not understood; her references to that part of the adventure had been so
general as to leave the impression that her husband was finding it just
as she set off with Chloe.<Node id="169047" />

<Node id="169049" />Now she retaliated by turning her back full on him and saying to
Tumulty: 'I should like to talk with you, Sir Giles.<Node id="169166" /> <Node id="169167" />Could you spare me
half an hour at Grosvenor Square?<Node id="169219" />'<Node id="169220" />

<Node id="169222" />Sir Giles's first impulse was to tell her to go to hell.<Node id="169278" /> <Node id="169279" />But he felt
that Lord Arglay had changed in something; his previous good temper had
gone.<Node id="169368" /> <Node id="169369" />Tumulty had been through too many dangerous experiences in remote
parts of the world not to recognize hostility when he met it, and he
knew that Arglay was hostile now.<Node id="169537" /> <Node id="169538" />Why he couldn't imagine but that was
the fact.<Node id="169584" /> <Node id="169585" />If Arglay was going to turn nasty it might be as well to be
in with this woman, whoever she was.<Node id="169681" /> <Node id="169682" />If she had bought the Stone there
must be money and therefore power and probably position, and perhaps a
counterweight to the Chief Justice's enmity.<Node id="169831" /> <Node id="169832" />Not that it mattered very
much; he wasn't going to spend any time shooting at Arglay with any
possible kind of inconvenient elephant rifle.<Node id="169971" /> <Node id="169972" />But obviously these two
weren't on the best of terms, and Sir Giles's generally diffused
contempt suddenly crystallized in a definite hatred of this large man
looming in front of him.<Node id="170155" /> <Node id="170156" />He accepted a card, refused to make a definite
promise; he wasn't going to be rung up as if he were her chauffeur--but
said something about ringing up, and with a malicious benevolence got
rid of her.<Node id="170356" /> <Node id="170357" />She departed, her mind stabilized by his brusque assurance
that she had an entire right to her Stone.<Node id="170458" /> <Node id="170459" />Chloe half rose; Lord Arglay
waved her back.<Node id="170503" /> <Node id="170504" />Sir Giles flung himself into a chair.<Node id="170541" /> '<Node id="170543" />Now,' he said,
'what's _your_ trouble, Arglay--that is, if it's fit for your ...<Node id="170623" />
<Node id="170624" />secretary ...<Node id="170637" /> <Node id="170638" />to hear.<Node id="170646" />' <Node id="170648" />It was the minutest pause before 'secretary';
both his hearers remarked it, and neither of them took any notice of it.<Node id="170766" />

<Node id="170768" />'<Node id="170769" />I want to know,' Arglay said, 'what you've been doing at Birmingham.<Node id="170837" />'<Node id="170838" />

<Node id="170840" />Genuinely surprised, Sir Giles stared at him.<Node id="170885" /> '<Node id="170887" />But that's exactly what I
want to tell you,' he said.<Node id="170940" /> '<Node id="170942" />I want you to find out, one way or another,
what _has_ happened.<Node id="171006" />'<Node id="171007" />

<Node id="171009" />'<Node id="171010" />I promise you I will do that,' Arglay answered.<Node id="171057" /> '<Node id="171059" />But you shall tell me
first what you have done.<Node id="171106" />'<Node id="171107" />

<Node id="171109" />'<Node id="171110" />Don't talk to me like that,' Sir Giles snapped back.<Node id="171162" /> '<Node id="171164" />You're not in
your bestial Law Courts now.<Node id="171206" /> <Node id="171207" />Palliser and I made an experiment this
morning, and I'm not at all clear----'<Node id="171284" />

<Node id="171286" />'<Node id="171287" />I want to know,' Arglay interrupted, 'about your experiment last
night.<Node id="171358" />'<Node id="171359" />

<Node id="171361" />More and more astonished, Sir Giles sat up.<Node id="171404" /> '<Node id="171406" />Last night?<Node id="171417" />' <Node id="171419" />he said, 'what
do you know about last night?<Node id="171463" /> <Node id="171464" />Not that there's anything particular to
know.<Node id="171509" /> <Node id="171510" />You're not interested in Palliser's kindergarten school, are you?<Node id="171575" />'<Node id="171576" />

<Node id="171578" />'<Node id="171579" />Who was the man you gave the Stone to?<Node id="171617" />' <Node id="171619" />the Chief Justice insisted,
'and what happened to him?<Node id="171673" />'<Node id="171674" />

<Node id="171676" />'<Node id="171677" />Now how do you know all that?<Node id="171706" />' <Node id="171708" />Sir Giles said meditatively.<Node id="171736" /> '<Node id="171738" />God strike
you dead, Arglay, have you been spying on me with that blasted bit of
dried dung?<Node id="171830" /> <Node id="171831" />You have, have you?<Node id="171850" /> <Node id="171851" />So it does do something with knowledge.<Node id="171890" />
<Node id="171891" />Good, that's what I wanted to know.<Node id="171926" /> <Node id="171927" />Now listen.<Node id="171938" /> <Node id="171939" />This morning Palliser
and I----'<Node id="171971" />

<Node id="171973" />'<Node id="171974" />What happened to the man last night?<Node id="172010" />' <Node id="172012" />Lord Arglay said again.<Node id="172035" />

<Node id="172037" />'<Node id="172038" />O how the hell do I know?<Node id="172063" />' <Node id="172065" />Sir Giles said fretfully.<Node id="172090" /> '<Node id="172092" />That's part of
the whole thing.<Node id="172123" /> <Node id="172124" />You can have him--I don't want him.<Node id="172159" /> <Node id="172160" />He's probably
messing round last week--no, we said twelve hours so he won't be.<Node id="172239" /> <Node id="172240" />As a
matter of fact I thought he might come back in another twelve but we
were there--at least, Palliser was--by nine this morning and he hadn't.<Node id="172385" />
<Node id="172386" />But you can go and look for him.<Node id="172418" /> <Node id="172419" />Only I want you to tell me first
whether I'm here or not.<Node id="172476" />' <Node id="172478" />He succeeded in outlining his problem.<Node id="172516" />

<Node id="172518" />In spite of himself Lord Arglay was held by it.<Node id="172565" />

<Node id="172567" />'<Node id="172568" />But so far as I'm concerned, it's certainly you--the normal corporeal
sequential you I'm talking to,' he said.<Node id="172678" /> '<Node id="172680" />I've not missed half an hour.<Node id="172709" />'<Node id="172710" />

<Node id="172712" />'<Node id="172713" />I know _that_,' Sir Giles moaned.<Node id="172746" /> '<Node id="172748" />I know that what's happening now is
happening to you.<Node id="172801" /> <Node id="172802" />But I don't know whether I'm knowing it all first of
all.<Node id="172859" /> <Node id="172860" />It's this damned silly business of only actually experiencing the
smallest minimum of time and all the rest being memory that does me in.<Node id="172997" />
<Node id="172998" />I know it was memory at twelve o'clock but if I'd lived through it all
it would still be memory.<Node id="173094" /> <Node id="173095" />O for God's sake, Arglay, don't be as big a
fool as Palliser.<Node id="173156" /> <Node id="173157" />I suppose you've got _some_ brains; after all they
made you Chief Justice.<Node id="173231" /> <Node id="173232" />And if you can see what happened in Birmingham
last night you can see what happened there this morning.<Node id="173335" /> <Node id="173336" />You needn't be
afraid; we can define the whole thing first of all, so you're bound to
come back all right.<Node id="173442" />'<Node id="173443" />

<Node id="173445" />'<Node id="173446" />I will do nothing at all,' Lord Arglay said, 'until I have done what I
can for your----' he paused on the word 'victim' which sounded
theatrical.<Node id="173591" /> '<Node id="173593" />And even then,' he said, slurring it, 'I do not know what I
can do, for I do not think this Stone was meant to be used to save such
men as you from the consequences of their actions.<Node id="173775" />'<Node id="173776" />

<Node id="173778" />'<Node id="173779" />What _do_ you think it was meant for?<Node id="173816" />' <Node id="173818" />Sir Giles said.<Node id="173833" /> '<Node id="173835" />And not so
much of this infant school Scripture lesson.<Node id="173890" /> <Node id="173891" />I'd see your inside torn
out, Arglay, before I asked you to save me.<Node id="173959" /> <Node id="173960" />I want to know what _does_
happen and if you won't tell me the nearest warder in the Zoological
Gardens will do as well.<Node id="174080" />'<Node id="174081" />

<Node id="174083" />'<Node id="174084" />Then you can go and ask him,' Lord Arglay said, recovering something of
his good temper, partly because he began to discern that, somehow or
other, the unfortunate assistant might be given a chance of return, and
partly because he did not dislike seeing Sir Giles really thwarted.<Node id="174364" /> '<Node id="174366" />I'm
not going to do a thing without very great care.<Node id="174418" /> <Node id="174419" />And you'd better take
care what you do because, if you're right, you'll have to do it all
again.<Node id="174515" />'<Node id="174516" />

<Node id="174518" />'<Node id="174519" />O my lord God Almighty,' Sir Giles said, 'can't you see that, _if_ I'm
right, I can't choose till next time?<Node id="174627" /> <Node id="174628" />You are a louse-brained catalept,
Arglay.<Node id="174669" />' <Node id="174671" />His interest in pure thought vanished and his personal concern
returned.<Node id="174743" /> '<Node id="174745" />So you're not going to do anything, aren't you?<Node id="174792" />' <Node id="174794" />he said.<Node id="174802" />

<Node id="174804" />'<Node id="174805" />Not for a day or two,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="174845" /> '<Node id="174847" />It'll do you all the good in
the world, Giles, to be a little uncertain of yourself.<Node id="174931" /> <Node id="174932" />Well, you can't
object to that way of putting it, surely; you are exactly a little
uncertain of yourself, aren't you?<Node id="175049" />'<Node id="175050" />

<Node id="175052" />Sir Giles said nothing.<Node id="175075" /> <Node id="175076" />He sat for a minute or two gazing at the Chief
Justice, then he got up, and with a conversational, 'Well, well, well,'
walked straight out of the room.<Node id="175227" /> <Node id="175228" />Lord Arglay looked at Chloe.<Node id="175256" />

<Node id="175258" />'<Node id="175259" />I refrain from saying "Curiouser and curiouser,"' he said, 'but I
can't think of anything else to say.<Node id="175361" /> <Node id="175362" />The efficient Giles has been
caught.<Node id="175398" /> <Node id="175399" />How just a compensation!<Node id="175423" /> <Node id="175424" />The Stone is a very marvellous thing.<Node id="175461" />'
<Node id="175463" />His voice, even on the words, changed into gravity.<Node id="175514" /> '<Node id="175516" />And now,' he went
on, 'suppose you tell me what did happen this afternoon.<Node id="175590" />'<Node id="175591" />

<Node id="175593" />When she had done so--'Then for all we know one of them is lying about
the English country-side?<Node id="175689" />' <Node id="175691" />the Chief Justice said.<Node id="175714" /> '<Node id="175716" />Pleasant hearing for
our friend the Hajji.<Node id="175758" /> <Node id="175759" />And now for my experiments.<Node id="175786" />' <Node id="175788" />He went over his
experiences of the previous evening.<Node id="175841" />

<Node id="175843" />'<Node id="175844" />So,' he ended, 'we know it moves in time and space and thought.<Node id="175907" /> <Node id="175908" />And in
what else?<Node id="175925" />'<Node id="175926" />

<Node id="175928" />'<Node id="175929" />But what else is there?<Node id="175952" />' <Node id="175954" />Chloe said.<Node id="175965" />

<Node id="175967" />'<Node id="175968" />The Hajji talked of the Transcendence,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="176029" /> '<Node id="176031" />But who
knows what he meant or if what he meant is so?<Node id="176085" />'<Node id="176086" />

<Node id="176088" />Chloe said, almost with pain, 'But what do _you_ think he meant?<Node id="176152" />'<Node id="176153" />

<Node id="176155" />'<Node id="176156" />Child,' Lord Arglay said, 'I am an old man and I have known nothing
all my life farther or greater than the work I have taken to do.<Node id="176288" /> <Node id="176289" />I have
never seen a base for any temple nor found an excuse to believe in the
myths that are told there.<Node id="176393" /> <Node id="176394" />I will not say _believe_ or _do not believe_.<Node id="176439" />
<Node id="176440" />But there is one thing only of which I have wondered at times, and yet
it seemed foolish to think of it.<Node id="176544" /> <Node id="176545" />It will happen sometimes when one has
worked hard and done all that one can for the purpose before one--it has
happened then that I have stood up and been content with the world of
things and with what has been done there through me.<Node id="176778" /> <Node id="176779" />And this may be
pride, or it may be the full stress of the whole being and delight in
labour--there are a hundred explanations.<Node id="176906" /> <Node id="176907" />But I have wondered whether
that profound repose was not communicated from some far source and
whether the life that is in it was altogether governed by time.<Node id="177065" /> <Node id="177066" />And I am
sure that state never comes while I am concerned with myself, and I have
thought to-day that in some strange way that state was itself the Stone.<Node id="177220" />
<Node id="177221" />But if so then assuredly none of these men shall find its secret.<Node id="177286" />'<Node id="177287" />

<Node id="177289" />'<Node id="177290" />Is that the end of desire?<Node id="177316" />' <Node id="177318" />Chloe said.<Node id="177329" />

<Node id="177331" />'<Node id="177332" />I have no desire left at all,' Lord Arglay said, 'but I think that
other is the better ending of desire.<Node id="177436" /> <Node id="177437" />And though I cannot tell how you
should seek for it, I think it waits for everyone who will have it.<Node id="177537" /> <Node id="177538" />Also
I think that perhaps the Stone chooses more than we know; and yet that
is a fantasy, is it not?<Node id="177638" />'<Node id="177639" />

<Node id="177641" />'_<Node id="177643" />Was_ there a stone in the Crown of Suleiman?<Node id="177687" />' <Node id="177689" />she said, 'and was
Suleiman the wisest of men?<Node id="177735" />'<Node id="177736" />

<Node id="177738" />'<Node id="177739" />So they say,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="177774" /> '<Node id="177776" />And will you seek for wisdom in
the Stone?<Node id="177818" />'<Node id="177819" />

<Node id="177821" />'<Node id="177822" />What is wisdom?<Node id="177837" />' <Node id="177839" />Chloe said.<Node id="177850" />

<Node id="177852" />'<Node id="177853" />And that, child,' Lord Arglay answered again, 'though I am an
interpreter of all the laws of England, I do not know.<Node id="177969" />'<Node id="177970" />




<Node id="177975" />CHAPTER VII<Node id="177986" />

<Node id="177988" />THE MIRACLES AT RICH<Node id="178008" />


<Node id="178011" />Half-way down the stairs Mrs. Pentridge and Oliver Doncaster began to
realize that someone was knocking, loudly and continuously, at the door.<Node id="178153" />
<Node id="178154" />But the spectacle of Mrs. Ferguson in front of them, progressing, in
the dressing gown which she had put on, from stair to stair with an
alertness which her age, to say nothing of her paralysis, would have
seemed to forbid, so occupied and distracted them that it was with
reluctance that Mrs. Pentridge at last rushed to open, and with delight
that she said, hastily returning, 'It's for you, sir.<Node id="178552" />'<Node id="178553" />

<Node id="178555" />'<Node id="178556" />Eh?<Node id="178559" />' <Node id="178561" />said Oliver, 'me?<Node id="178578" /> <Node id="178579" />O nonsense!<Node id="178590" /> <Node id="178591" />O damn!<Node id="178598" />' <Node id="178600" />He remembered the lunatic
who wanted the stone, and strode across.<Node id="178666" /> '<Node id="178668" />Hallo,' he said, 'O it _is_
you!<Node id="178700" /> <Node id="178701" />Well, yes; yes, I'm sorry, but we're in a bit of a confusion just
now owing to a paralyzed old lady suddenly skipping like the high hills.<Node id="178839" />
<Node id="178840" />Could you wait a few minutes or go and have a drink or something?<Node id="178905" />'<Node id="178906" />

<Node id="178908" />'<Node id="178909" />No, I couldn't,' Sheldrake said.<Node id="178941" /> '<Node id="178943" />You've made me come all this way and
given me all this trouble, and now you talk to me about an old woman.<Node id="179049" /> <Node id="179050" />An
old woman won't stop you giving me my stone.<Node id="179097" />'<Node id="179098" />

<Node id="179100" />'<Node id="179101" />By the way, what did I do with it?<Node id="179135" />' <Node id="179137" />Doncaster asked vaguely.<Node id="179161" /> '<Node id="179163" />I know I
had it a few minutes ago.<Node id="179197" /> <Node id="179198" />Now what--I remember, I was showing it to Mrs.
Ferguson when she began to curvet.<Node id="179279" /> <Node id="179280" />I wonder if she dropped it
somewhere.<Node id="179317" />'<Node id="179318" />

<Node id="179320" />Sheldrake swore under his breath, then ceased as an incredible idea came
into his mind.<Node id="179407" /> '<Node id="179409" />Who's Mrs. Ferguson?<Node id="179429" />' <Node id="179431" />he asked.<Node id="179440" />

<Node id="179442" />'<Node id="179443" />Mrs.<Node id="179447" /> <Node id="179448" />Ferguson is my landlady's mother,' Doncaster said.<Node id="179498" /> '<Node id="179500" />Who having
been in bed to my knowledge since just before I came last year is now
jazzing like a two-year-old.<Node id="179609" /> <Node id="179610" />Peep round the door.<Node id="179630" /> <Node id="179631" />Well, you don't
suppose I'm going to interrupt her by asking for my--I mean your--at
least I mean you said your--pebble, do you?<Node id="179759" /> <Node id="179760" />Bless her, she's like a
child at a Sunday school treat.<Node id="179815" />'<Node id="179816" />

<Node id="179818" />Sheldrake became more and more uneasy.<Node id="179856" /> <Node id="179857" />If this infernal old woman--if
the Stone could cure--if it got about----'Look here,' he said quite
untruly to Oliver, 'I've got to get on to London and I want to take my
property with me.<Node id="180044" /> <Node id="180045" />A joke's a joke, but----'<Node id="180070" />

<Node id="180072" />'<Node id="180073" />And a jubilee's a jubilee,' Oliver said.<Node id="180113" /> '<Node id="180115" />Still, I see your point.<Node id="180139" />
<Node id="180140" />Well, wait a minute----Good heavens, she's going out.<Node id="180193" />'<Node id="180194" />

<Node id="180196" />Mrs.<Node id="180200" /> <Node id="180201" />Ferguson indeed was coming straight to the door.<Node id="180249" /> <Node id="180250" />When she reached
it Oliver pulled Sheldrake aside.<Node id="180300" /> '<Node id="180302" />Still feeling better, Mrs. Ferguson?<Node id="180338" />'
<Node id="180340" />he asked.<Node id="180349" />

<Node id="180351" />'<Node id="180352" />Much better, thank you, sir,' the old lady said.<Node id="180400" /> '<Node id="180402" />But I feel as if I
could do with a little fresh air, and if it looked a nice evening I was
thinking I'd just pop along and see my sister Annie.<Node id="180545" /> <Node id="180546" />I haven't seen much
of her this year owing to her asthma and my not being able to get out.<Node id="180636" />
<Node id="180637" />Mary, my dear,' she added to Mrs. Pentridge, 'I think I'll dress.<Node id="180702" />'<Node id="180703" />

<Node id="180705" />'<Node id="180706" />O mother,' said Mrs. Pentridge, 'do you think you ought to go out?<Node id="180772" />
<Node id="180773" />Suppose you were taken bad again?<Node id="180806" />'<Node id="180807" />

<Node id="180809" />Mrs.<Node id="180813" /> <Node id="180814" />Ferguson smiled serenely.<Node id="180839" /> '<Node id="180841" />I shan't be taken bad,' she said,
'I never felt better in all my life.<Node id="180911" /> <Node id="180912" />And I owe it all to you, Mr.
Doncaster,' she added.<Node id="180963" />

<Node id="180965" />'<Node id="180966" />Me?<Node id="180969" />' <Node id="180971" />said the surprised Oliver.<Node id="180997" />

<Node id="180999" />'<Node id="181000" />I felt the strength just pouring into me from that stone you gave me,
sir,' Mrs. Ferguson assured him.<Node id="181102" /> '<Node id="181104" />I've got it tight.<Node id="181122" /> <Node id="181123" />You don't want it
back this minute, do you, sir?<Node id="181171" />'<Node id="181172" />

<Node id="181174" />'<Node id="181175" />Certainly not, Mrs. Ferguson,' Doncaster said promptly.<Node id="181230" /> '<Node id="181232" />Keep it an
hour or two and see how you feel.<Node id="181276" />'<Node id="181277" />

<Node id="181279" />'<Node id="181280" />O nonsense,' Sheldrake broke in,--'look here, Mrs.----'<Node id="181335" />

<Node id="181337" />'<Node id="181338" />Shut up,' said Oliver.<Node id="181360" /> '<Node id="181362" />That's all right, Mrs. Ferguson.<Node id="181394" /> <Node id="181395" />Carry on.<Node id="181404" />'<Node id="181405" />

<Node id="181407" />'<Node id="181408" />I won't shut up,' Sheldrake shouted.<Node id="181444" /> '<Node id="181446" />What the hell do you think you're
doing, throwing other people's property about?<Node id="181526" />'<Node id="181527" />

<Node id="181529" />'<Node id="181530" />How do I know it's your property?<Node id="181563" />' <Node id="181565" />Oliver shouted back.<Node id="181585" /> '<Node id="181587" />I pick a bit
of stone out of a hedge and you pop up out of a sound sleep and say your
wife threw it there and will I give it back?<Node id="181717" /> <Node id="181718" />Who are you, anyhow?<Node id="181738" />'<Node id="181739" />

<Node id="181741" />'<Node id="181742" />My name is Sheldrake, Angus M. Sheldrake,' the other answered.<Node id="181804" /> '<Node id="181806" />I'm the
chairman of Atlantic Airways and half a dozen other things.<Node id="181873" /> <Node id="181874" />I gave
seventy thousand pounds for that stone and I want it back at once.<Node id="181947" />'<Node id="181948" />

<Node id="181950" />'<Node id="181951" />Then you won't get it back at once,' Oliver retorted, 'not if you were
the chairman of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Antarctic
air, sea, and land ways, and the Tube railways too.<Node id="182142" /> <Node id="182143" />Not if you offered
me another seventy thousand--at least, you might then.<Node id="182216" /> <Node id="182217" />I don't know, so
don't tempt me.<Node id="182249" /> <Node id="182250" />Or rather do, so that I can say, "Keep your dross.<Node id="182300" />"
<Node id="182302" />Start with fifty thousand, and go up by fives.<Node id="182348" />'<Node id="182349" />

<Node id="182351" />'<Node id="182352" />By God,' Sheldrake said, 'I'll have you all in prison for this.<Node id="182415" />'<Node id="182416" />

<Node id="182418" />'<Node id="182419" />Don't be a fool,' Oliver answered crossly.<Node id="182461" /> '<Node id="182463" />Go and wake up Job Ricketts
and tell him to arrest old Mrs. Ferguson for stealing your stone.<Node id="182556" /> <Node id="182557" />I
should like to see you explaining.<Node id="182593" />'<Node id="182594" />

<Node id="182596" />The quarrel raged in this manner until Mrs. Ferguson, cloak and bonnet
on, came to the door to start.<Node id="182697" /> '<Node id="182699" />Is it the gentleman's stone, sir?<Node id="182732" />' <Node id="182734" />she
asked anxiously.<Node id="182754" />

<Node id="182756" />'<Node id="182757" />He doesn't know, I don't know,' Oliver told her.<Node id="182805" /> '<Node id="182807" />Get you along,
Mrs. Ferguson, but don't let it go out of your possession.<Node id="182880" /> <Node id="182881" />I call
everybody to witness,' he said loudly, addressing Mrs. Ferguson, Mrs.
Pentridge, Sheldrake, the chauffeur, and the villagers who were
beginning to collect, 'that Mrs. Ruth Ferguson retains the property in
question--namely, a stone--on my instructions until I am satisfied of
the bona-fides of the claimant, one Angus M. Sheldrake on his own
confession.<Node id="183240" /> <Node id="183241" />There,' he added to Sheldrake.<Node id="183271" />

<Node id="183273" />'<Node id="183274" />What the devil do you suppose is the good of that?<Node id="183324" />' <Node id="183326" />Sheldrake said
furiously.<Node id="183351" />

<Node id="183353" />'<Node id="183354" />I don't really know,' Oliver said comfortably, 'but it creates a right
impression, don't you think?<Node id="183453" />'<Node id="183454" />

<Node id="183456" />'<Node id="183457" />But do you expect me to prove the whole bally thing to any fool who
stops me in the street or any pickpocket who sneaks it?<Node id="183580" />' <Node id="183582" />Sheldrake
raged.<Node id="183598" />

<Node id="183600" />'<Node id="183601" />To be accurate, it was you who stopped me and wanted to pick my
pocket--in effect,' Oliver said.<Node id="183697" /> '<Node id="183699" />And we might as well spend the next
two or three hours proving your bona-fides as not, don't you think?<Node id="183802" />'<Node id="183803" />

<Node id="183805" />'<Node id="183806" />I'm not going to let that woman out of my sight,' Sheldrake said.<Node id="183871" />
'<Node id="183873" />Where she goes I go.<Node id="183893" />'<Node id="183894" />

<Node id="183896" />'<Node id="183897" />Her people shall be thy people and her gods thy gods,' Oliver murmured.<Node id="183968" />
'<Node id="183970" />Sudden conversion of a millionaire.<Node id="184005" /> <Node id="184006" />The call of the old home.<Node id="184031" /> <Node id="184032" />Way down
on the Swanee River.<Node id="184061" /> <Node id="184062" />O Dixie, my Dixie, our fearful trip is done.<Node id="184106" />'<Node id="184107" />

<Node id="184109" />'<Node id="184110" />O go to the devil,' Sheldrake said, leaping back to his car.<Node id="184170" /> '<Node id="184172" />Barnes,
follow that damned old woman in the black bonnet.<Node id="184229" />'<Node id="184230" />

<Node id="184232" />'<Node id="184233" />Yes, sir,' the chauffeur said obediently, and the procession
started--Mrs.<Node id="184307" /> <Node id="184308" />Ferguson and Mrs. Pentridge in front, Oliver strolling a
few paces behind, the car rolling along in the road, parallel to him,
and an increasing crowd of villagers, dissolving, reforming, chattering
and exclaiming as the astonishing news spread.<Node id="184553" /> <Node id="184554" />Rather owing to this
tumultuous concourse than to any weakness on Mrs. Ferguson's part it
took them an hour to reach the mile-distant town of Rich-by-the-Mere,
commonly called Rich, where Mrs. Ferguson's asthmatic sister lived.<Node id="184781" /> <Node id="184782" />By
the time they reached her street the crowd was a mob, the car was doing
the best it could among the excited groups, and Oliver had been pushed
forward on to Mrs. Ferguson's heels.<Node id="184964" /> <Node id="184965" />The old lady knocked at the door,
which was opened in a minute, and there followed immediately a loud
scream.<Node id="185074" />

<Node id="185076" />'<Node id="185077" />Ruth!<Node id="185082" />' <Node id="185084" />cried a voice.<Node id="185098" />

<Node id="185100" />'<Node id="185101" />All right, Annie,' Mrs. Ferguson was heard to protest and the
excitement in the crowd grew louder.<Node id="185199" />

<Node id="185201" />Sheldrake felt almost off his head with anger, despair, and doubt.<Node id="185267" /> <Node id="185268" />He
had realized during the slow crawl that to go to the police would be to
broadcast the rumours of the Stone, but what was to happen he could not
guess.<Node id="185421" /> <Node id="185422" />That he would recover it he had no real doubt, but he wanted to
recover it quietly and get out of England with it at the earliest
possible moment.<Node id="185568" /> <Node id="185569" />He peered out of the car to see Oliver, his back
against the door of the house, giving a dramatic description of Mrs.
Ferguson's recovery to as many of the crowd as could hear him; he saw,
remotely, the helmets of one or two policemen approaching slowly; he saw
windows and doors open all round and new conversations leaping up every
moment; he even discerned one or two members of the crowd scribbling in
small notebooks, and dropped back with an oath.<Node id="186022" /> <Node id="186023" />But he sat up again in a
moment and managed to attract Oliver's attention, who slid through the
crowd to the car.<Node id="186136" />

<Node id="186138" />'<Node id="186139" />Look here,' he said, 'this is past a joke.<Node id="186181" /> <Node id="186182" />I apologize if I was rude.<Node id="186208" /> <Node id="186209" />I
can prove anything you want me to.<Node id="186245" /> <Node id="186246" />But as a matter of fact the stone
does belong to me, and I must rely on you to get it back.<Node id="186337" /> <Node id="186338" />You believe
me, don't you?<Node id="186364" />'<Node id="186365" />

<Node id="186367" />'<Node id="186368" />I do really,' Oliver said.<Node id="186394" /> '<Node id="186396" />You were a bit uppish, you know, but I
don't understand what's happened.<Node id="186468" /> <Node id="186469" />Of course, it's all nonsense about the
stone healing her, but as things have turned out we shall have to go
gently.<Node id="186584" /> <Node id="186585" />We can't have the poor old thing pushed back into bed because
we take it away brutally.<Node id="186672" /> <Node id="186673" />Leave it to me and I'll get it back for you
to-night.<Node id="186726" /> <Node id="186727" />Where do you live?<Node id="186745" />'<Node id="186746" />

<Node id="186748" />Angus told him.<Node id="186763" /> <Node id="186764" />Oliver grimaced.<Node id="186780" /> '<Node id="186782" />A bit of a way,' he said, 'but I
suppose it was my fault.<Node id="186839" /> <Node id="186840" />Well, I'll try and collect it gently to-night
or to-morrow morning.<Node id="186907" />'<Node id="186908" />

<Node id="186910" />'<Node id="186911" />Excuse me, sir,' a voice beside him said, 'but can you tell me whether
it's true that an old lady has been cured of cancer by a piece of
magnetic iron?<Node id="187062" /> <Node id="187063" />Does it belong to you or to this other gentleman?<Node id="187112" /> <Node id="187113" />And is
it true that she----'<Node id="187141" />

<Node id="187143" />Oliver and Sheldrake stared at each other.<Node id="187185" /> <Node id="187186" />Suddenly Oliver looked round.<Node id="187215" />
<Node id="187216" />Out of the window of the house Mrs. Pentridge was leaning.<Node id="187274" />

<Node id="187276" />'<Node id="187277" />O Mr. Doncaster,' she called, 'do please come.<Node id="187323" /> <Node id="187324" />Auntie's asthma's gone.<Node id="187347" />
<Node id="187348" />It went in the middle of a cough.<Node id="187381" /> <Node id="187382" />O do come.<Node id="187392" />'<Node id="187393" />

<Node id="187395" />The noise broke out deafeningly.<Node id="187427" /> <Node id="187428" />Mr. Sheldrake flung himself down in the
car, and the small reporter fought his way beside Oliver to the door.<Node id="187537" />

<Node id="187539" />The next morning they all read it.<Node id="187573" /> <Node id="187574" />Chloe at Highgate in a paper
purchased when she saw the placards, Lord Arglay at Lancaster Gate
in the _Observer_, Sir Giles at Ealing in his housekeeper's _Sunday
Pictorial_, Professor Palliser at Birmingham in the _Sunday Times_,
Reginald at Brighton (though this was purely by accident, in a paper he
picked up in the smoking-room of his hotel).<Node id="187922" /> <Node id="187923" />It was even stated long
afterwards, in a volume of memoirs, that at Sandringham the Majesty
of England, augustly chatting with Lord Birlesmere (the Minister in
attendance), the Persian Ambassador, and the author of the memoirs, had
graciously deigned to remark that it was a very extraordinary affair.<Node id="188224" />
<Node id="188225" />In the papers, Lourdes, the King's Evil, the Early Christians, Mrs.
Eddy, Mesmer, and other famous healers were introduced and, almost,
invoked.<Node id="188369" /> <Node id="188370" />For the scenes in Rich all night had been such 'as to baffle
description.<Node id="188443" />' <Node id="188445" />Once it had been understood that this impossible thing was
happening, that health was being restored, and that so simply, so
immediately, the house was almost rushed before the police could guard
it.<Node id="188644" /> <Node id="188645" />The two old ladies--Mrs.<Node id="188669" /> <Node id="188670" />Ferguson and her sister--with Mrs.
Pentridge were rushed up the stairs by Oliver, who, with one policeman
by him, stationed himself near the top, exhorting, arguing, fighting.<Node id="188845" />
<Node id="188846" />The crowd in the street was, with usual and immediate sympathy,
continually dividing to let cripples through or the blind and the deaf.<Node id="188981" />
<Node id="188982" />Many came rushing to borrow the Stone for the sick who could not come.<Node id="189052" />
<Node id="189053" />Sheldrake's car, opposite the front-door, was turned into a kind of
Grand Stand.<Node id="189133" /> <Node id="189134" />By midnight the whole place was in a tumult.<Node id="189178" /> <Node id="189179" />The loss of
the Stone itself became an imminent danger.<Node id="189234" /> <Node id="189235" />Sheldrake was continually
telling the police that it belonged to him; the police were concerned
with more difficult matters.<Node id="189359" /> <Node id="189360" />But the reporters had it.<Node id="189385" /> '<Node id="189387" />The Stone,'
they all declared, 'was said to belong to Mr. Angus M. Sheldrake, the
well-known...<Node id="189482" />' <Node id="189484" />and so on.<Node id="189494" /> <Node id="189495" />It was known all over England on that Sunday
morning that Mr. Angus M. Sheldrake owned--whether at the moment he
actually possessed was a little doubtful--a miraculous Stone which
healed all illnesses at a mere wish.<Node id="189711" />

<Node id="189713" />'<Node id="189714" />Well, really,' Lord Arglay said to himself, 'Reginald seems to have
done it this time.<Node id="189800" />'<Node id="189801" />

<Node id="189803" />Reginald was much of the same opinion.<Node id="189841" /> <Node id="189842" />But neither he nor anyone else
of those concerned had any idea what to do next.<Node id="189921" /> <Node id="189922" />The Persian Ambassador
took advantage of the afternoon quiet at Sandringham to point out to
Lord Birlesmere that if this were true, and if it were due to the relic
of which he had spoken, and if the news were telegraphed abroad the most
serious consequences might ensue.<Node id="190192" /> <Node id="190193" />Lord Birlesmere took note of his
Excellency's communication, and, later on, got through to Rivington
Court on the telephone.<Node id="190317" /> <Node id="190318" />He had met Sheldrake two or three times and
Angus came to speak.<Node id="190382" /> <Node id="190383" />But when he understood that the Foreign Secretary
was hinting at a personal interview he gave a little laugh.<Node id="190492" />

<Node id="190494" />'<Node id="190495" />My dear Lord Birlesmere,' he said, 'I couldn't if I would.<Node id="190553" /> <Node id="190554" />Not without
a couple of thousand soldiers and machine guns.<Node id="190613" /> <Node id="190614" />They're all round the
place, camping in the grounds, knocking at the doors.<Node id="190689" /> <Node id="190690" />Every town in the
district has discharged its halt and maimed here, and they all want me
to heal them.<Node id="190792" />'<Node id="190793" />

<Node id="190795" />'<Node id="190796" />And do you?<Node id="190807" />' <Node id="190809" />Lord Birlesmere asked, fascinated by the idea.<Node id="190855" />

<Node id="190857" />'<Node id="190858" />What?<Node id="190863" />' <Node id="190865" />said Mr. Sheldrake.<Node id="190884" />

<Node id="190886" />'<Node id="190887" />But aren't,' Lord Birlesmere went on, changing the subject, 'aren't the
County Authorities doing anything?<Node id="190993" />'<Node id="190994" />

<Node id="190996" />'<Node id="190997" />They've drafted all the police that they have to spare,' Sheldrake told
him, 'and they're communicating with London.<Node id="191113" /> <Node id="191114" />But it doesn't look as if
that would help me till to-morrow.<Node id="191174" />'<Node id="191175" />

<Node id="191177" />'<Node id="191178" />I'll talk to the Home Office people,' Birlesmere said.<Node id="191232" /> '<Node id="191234" />You won't mind
promising not to leave England or get rid of the Stone till I've seen
you?<Node id="191323" />'<Node id="191324" />

<Node id="191326" />Sheldrake hesitated.<Node id="191346" /> <Node id="191347" />His chief wish was to get out of England with the
Stone; on the other hand his chances of doing so in the face of an
antagonistic Foreign Office were small, and he was conscious that there
were certain crises in which the Foreign Office would offer no strings
for him to pull--the ends would all discreetly disappear.<Node id="191664" /> <Node id="191665" />He did not
completely understand why the Foreign Office was interfering at all; the
Stone hardly seemed to be their pigeon.<Node id="191788" /> <Node id="191789" />He had gathered from Cecilia
when she returned the night before, or rather when he had himself
returned that morning, that the Government was mixed up with it; and
of course the Stone was said to have come from abroad.<Node id="192007" /> <Node id="192008" />Still----<Node id="192017" />

<Node id="192019" />'<Node id="192020" />Well,' he said, 'if you'll get me out of this at once I don't mind
promising to see you before I leave.<Node id="192123" />'<Node id="192124" />

<Node id="192126" />'<Node id="192127" />But can't you really get away?<Node id="192157" />' <Node id="192159" />Lord Birlesmere asked.<Node id="192181" />

<Node id="192183" />It seemed to him inconceivable that any crowd could really prison a man
in his own country house, but that was because he had never seen it
happen.<Node id="192330" /> <Node id="192331" />The concourse round Mr. Sheldrake's front-door, between that
and the garage, trying to look in, and even to get in, at the windows,
continually flowing in through the gates, occupying the lawns, the
terraces, and the gardens, consisted of more people than Lord Birlesmere
had seen in all his life.<Node id="192628" /> <Node id="192629" />They were quiet while they were not interfered
with, in an uncertain quiet.<Node id="192704" /> <Node id="192705" />They doubted whether it was much good their
coming.<Node id="192756" /> <Node id="192757" />They might, before evening, disperse from sheer discouragement
and hunger; but the one or two attempts made by an insufficient band of
police to shift them had merely produced irritation and, once or twice,
something like serious trouble.<Node id="192995" />

<Node id="192997" />Lord Birlesmere, discovering all this by gentle questioning, at last,
with some sort of qualified promise, put the receiver back and stared at
it.<Node id="193143" /> <Node id="193144" />Soldiers were all very well, but the Government was shaky enough,
and what would the Opposition papers say if he used the Army to hold
back a crowd of suffering English men and women from their chance of
healing, and to ensure the escape of an American millionaire with the
source of healing in his possession?<Node id="193454" /> <Node id="193455" />The Opposition would know, as well
as Mr. Sheldrake, as well as Lord Birlesmere himself, that the idea of
the Stone doing anything was rubbish.<Node id="193598" /> <Node id="193599" />He wished the Prime Minister
was in London, but he wasn't; he was in Aberdeen.<Node id="193677" /> <Node id="193678" />The best thing was
obviously to get Sheldrake quietly to London--perhaps later the crowd
would disperse a bit--and then there was this Sir Giles Tumulty the
Persian Ambassador had mentioned--an interview there.<Node id="193888" /> <Node id="193889" />What on earth had
Bruce Cumberland been doing, if anything?<Node id="193948" /> <Node id="193949" />The thought of the Ambassador
suggested to Lord Birlesmere that it might be just as well if he did not
learn too much from the Persian; he didn't want to be put too clearly
in possession of the views of a friendly Government.<Node id="194174" /> <Node id="194175" />Sheldrake had
certainly better be removed quietly.<Node id="194225" /> <Node id="194226" />He took such measures as suggested
themselves.<Node id="194272" />

<Node id="194274" />On the same Sunday evening the Hajji came round to Lord Arglay's house.<Node id="194345" />
<Node id="194346" />The Chief Justice threw down the latest edition of a special evening
paper and greeted him with a certain pretended cynicism.<Node id="194471" /> '<Node id="194473" />This, I
suppose,' he said, 'is the evil you prophesied for the world--all this
healing, I mean?<Node id="194568" />'<Node id="194569" />

<Node id="194571" />'<Node id="194572" />There is not a great deal of healing so far; there is a great deal of
desire for healing,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="194680" /> '<Node id="194682" />That may be an evil.<Node id="194702" />'<Node id="194703" />

<Node id="194705" />'<Node id="194706" />If Sheldrake gets off to America with it, there'll be an evil all
right,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="194797" /> '<Node id="194799" />I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they passed
a special act to prevent him.<Node id="194873" />'<Node id="194874" />

<Node id="194876" />'<Node id="194877" />Can your Parliament do such things?<Node id="194912" />' <Node id="194914" />the Hajji asked.<Node id="194930" />

<Node id="194932" />'<Node id="194933" />O rather,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="194961" /> '<Node id="194963" />Prevention of Removal of Art Treasures,
I should think.<Node id="195018" /> <Node id="195019" />It'll take Sheldrake as long as we like to prove the
Stone isn't an Art Treasure.<Node id="195100" /> <Node id="195101" />Or they may claim that the sale is invalid
because it never was Reginald's; only then you'd want a real claimant.<Node id="195214" />
<Node id="195215" />And who could that be?<Node id="195237" /> <Node id="195238" />Not me, obviously; not Giles--he wouldn't; not
the Ambassador--they'd have to give it back to him.<Node id="195336" />'<Node id="195337" />

<Node id="195339" />'<Node id="195340" />You think they would not?<Node id="195365" />' <Node id="195367" />said the Hajji.<Node id="195382" />

<Node id="195384" />'<Node id="195385" />I am absolutely and perfectly sure they would not,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="195454" />
'<Node id="195456" />And really, Hajji, I don't know that I blame them.<Node id="195506" /> <Node id="195507" />After all, it's not
the kind of thing that any one man or family or country even ought to
keep.<Node id="195602" /> <Node id="195603" />I'm not at all sure it ought to be in existence at all, but after
what I've seen I can't think how to destroy it.<Node id="195716" /> <Node id="195717" />If you dropped it into
the Atlantic I should be afraid of it floating to the Esquimaux or some
such people.<Node id="195824" /> <Node id="195825" />And it can't be left loose.<Node id="195852" /> <Node id="195853" />Look at what happens when it
is.<Node id="195885" />'<Node id="195886" />

<Node id="195888" />'<Node id="195889" />What then.<Node id="195899" />' <Node id="195901" />the Hajji said, 'do you think should be done with it?<Node id="195954" />'<Node id="195955" />

<Node id="195957" />'<Node id="195958" />I can't think,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="195991" /> '<Node id="195993" />Unless the League of Nations?<Node id="196022" /> <Node id="196023" />With
a special international guard?<Node id="196058" /> <Node id="196059" />No?<Node id="196062" /> <Node id="196063" />I was afraid you wouldn't agree.<Node id="196095" />'<Node id="196096" />

<Node id="196098" />'<Node id="196099" />You are mocking at it and me,' the Hajji said.<Node id="196145" />

<Node id="196147" />'<Node id="196148" />No, I'm not,' the Chief Justice assured him.<Node id="196192" /> '<Node id="196194" />I'm a little
de-normally-mented about it.<Node id="196235" /> <Node id="196236" />But I take it very seriously.<Node id="196265" /> <Node id="196266" />When the
English take anything very seriously they always become a trifle
delirious.<Node id="196350" /> <Node id="196351" />People tell you that we aren't logical, but it isn't true.<Node id="196409" />
<Node id="196410" />Only our logic is a logic of poetry.<Node id="196446" /> <Node id="196447" />We are the Tom o' Bedlam of the
nations, the sceptics of the world, and we have no hope at all, or none
to speak of--that is why we are always so good at adopting new ideas.<Node id="196620" />
<Node id="196621" />Look at the way Reginald adopted the Stone.<Node id="196664" />'<Node id="196665" />

<Node id="196667" />The Hajji went on looking at him gravely.<Node id="196708" /> '<Node id="196710" />And what are you going to do
now?<Node id="196743" />' <Node id="196745" />he said.<Node id="196753" />

<Node id="196755" />'<Node id="196756" />I'm in several minds,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="196796" /> '<Node id="196798" />And one is to take the Stone
and will myself wherever what you call its Types are and collect them
all one by one, whether their present possessors agree or not, and then
will myself inside Vesuvius with them all.<Node id="197011" /> <Node id="197012" />And one is to go and look for
this Pondon fellow.<Node id="197061" /> <Node id="197062" />And another is to go and knock Giles on the head.<Node id="197111" />
<Node id="197112" />That's three--and the fourth?<Node id="197141" /> <Node id="197142" />The fourth is to take the Stone and will
it to do what it will with me.<Node id="197213" />'<Node id="197214" />

<Node id="197216" />'<Node id="197217" />And that is the most dangerous of all,' the Hajji said.<Node id="197272" />

<Node id="197274" />'<Node id="197275" />After all,' Arglay argued, 'if Miss Burnett seems to think she can get
wisdom from it, why shouldn't I?<Node id="197378" />'<Node id="197379" />

<Node id="197381" />'<Node id="197382" />Does she?<Node id="197391" />' <Node id="197393" />the Hajji asked.<Node id="197409" />

<Node id="197411" />'<Node id="197412" />No, of course she doesn't,' Lord Arglay said irritably.<Node id="197467" /> '<Node id="197469" />It was I who
asked her that.<Node id="197497" /> <Node id="197498" />Hajji, I'm just rambling.<Node id="197523" /> <Node id="197524" />But what in God's name can we
_do_?<Node id="197559" />'<Node id="197560" />

<Node id="197562" />The Hajji brooded.<Node id="197580" /> '<Node id="197582" />I think that it only knows,' he said.<Node id="197619" /> '<Node id="197621" />But I dare
not use it at all, because it is so great and terrible, and I do not
think you believe in it enough for it to reveal its will.<Node id="197758" /> <Node id="197759" />What of this
friend of yours?<Node id="197788" />'<Node id="197789" />

<Node id="197791" />'<Node id="197792" />Who?<Node id="197796" />' <Node id="197798" />Lord Arglay said blankly.<Node id="197823" />

<Node id="197825" />'<Node id="197826" />This Miss Burnett,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="197863" /> '<Node id="197865" />Does she believe?<Node id="197882" />'<Node id="197883" />

<Node id="197885" />Lord Arglay stared at him.<Node id="197911" /> '<Node id="197913" />What if she does?<Node id="197930" /> <Node id="197931" />What can she believe
_in_?<Node id="197957" />' <Node id="197959" />he said.<Node id="197967" /> '<Node id="197969" />Are you proposing to play some such trick on her as
Giles did on Pondon?<Node id="198041" /> <Node id="198042" />Because if so, Hajji, I may as well tell you I
shall stop it.<Node id="198103" /> <Node id="198104" />Besides, why do you think she'd find out?<Node id="198145" />'<Node id="198146" />

<Node id="198148" />'<Node id="198149" />If--no, it is impossible,' the Hajji said.<Node id="198191" /> '<Node id="198193" />But I dreamed that I saw
the Name of Allah written on her forehead as it is written on the Stone.<Node id="198290" />
<Node id="198291" />And it is certain that the way to the Stone is in the Stone.<Node id="198351" />'<Node id="198352" />

<Node id="198354" />'<Node id="198355" />Then,' Lord Arglay said, not unreasonably, 'why don't you take it?<Node id="198421" />'<Node id="198422" />

<Node id="198424" />'<Node id="198425" />Those of my house,' the Hajji answered reluctantly, 'who were of the
Keepers have sworn always to guard and never to use the Relics they
keep.<Node id="198567" /> <Node id="198568" />Neither this nor a yet more sacred thing.<Node id="198609" />'<Node id="198610" />

<Node id="198612" />'<Node id="198613" />What else is there then?<Node id="198637" />' <Node id="198639" />Arglay asked.<Node id="198652" />

<Node id="198654" />'<Node id="198655" />There is that which is in the Innermost,' the Hajji answered, 'that
which controls all things.<Node id="198749" /> <Node id="198750" />And I fear lest by the knowledge of the Stone
any shall come to find this other thing.<Node id="198836" /> <Node id="198837" />For it is said that even
Asmodeus when he wore it sat on the throne of Suleiman ben Daood in
Jerusalem, and if your Giles Tumulty----'<Node id="198971" />

<Node id="198973" />'<Node id="198974" />I expect even Asmodeus was a gentleman compared with Giles,' Lord
Arglay said.<Node id="199052" /> '<Node id="199054" />But seriously, Hajji, do you mean that there is something
else behind?<Node id="199124" /> <Node id="199125" />And if so what is it?<Node id="199146" />'<Node id="199147" />

<Node id="199149" />'<Node id="199150" />I must not tell you,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="199185" />

<Node id="199187" />'<Node id="199188" />Quite,' Lord Arglay answered, half as a gibe, half as a submission.<Node id="199255" />
'<Node id="199257" />It's all very useful, isn't it?<Node id="199288" /> <Node id="199289" />Well, Hajji, will you help me to find
this Pondon man?<Node id="199343" /> <Node id="199344" />Is there any particular formula?<Node id="199376" />'<Node id="199377" />

<Node id="199379" />'<Node id="199380" />I think you had need be careful,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="199431" /> '<Node id="199433" />For if you will to
return to the worlds that were you will not have the Stone with you.<Node id="199520" />'<Node id="199521" />

<Node id="199523" />'<Node id="199524" />Giles's idea seemed to be,' Lord Arglay said, 'that one could will to
return to the past for ten minutes or so.<Node id="199635" />'<Node id="199636" />

<Node id="199638" />'<Node id="199639" />I do not see how you can bring this man back from the past without the
Stone, and if you return to the past you will not have the Stone,' the
Hajji said doubtfully.<Node id="199803" /> '<Node id="199805" />Besides, though you can return to your own past,
I do not know whether you can return to his.<Node id="199898" />'<Node id="199899" />

<Node id="199901" />'<Node id="199902" />But why can't I go to him _now_,' Lord Arglay said, 'wherever he is
_now_?<Node id="199976" /> <Node id="199977" />Damn it, man, he must be somewhere _now_.<Node id="200018" />'<Node id="200019" />

<Node id="200021" />'<Node id="200022" />If you are right, he is nowhere at all _now_,' the Hajji said.<Node id="200084" /> '<Node id="200086" />He has
not yet reached _now_.<Node id="200115" /> <Node id="200116" />He is in yesterday.<Node id="200135" />'<Node id="200136" />

<Node id="200138" />'<Node id="200139" />O Lord!<Node id="200146" />' <Node id="200148" />the Chief Justice said.<Node id="200171" /> '<Node id="200173" />But he must be somewhere in space.<Node id="200207" />'<Node id="200208" />

<Node id="200210" />'<Node id="200211" />O in space he is no doubt here or there or anywhere,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="200282" />
'<Node id="200284" />For yesterday's space is exactly where to-day's space is.<Node id="200341" />'<Node id="200342" />

<Node id="200344" />'<Node id="200345" />And to-morrow's also?<Node id="200366" />' <Node id="200368" />Lord Arglay said.<Node id="200385" />

<Node id="200387" />'<Node id="200388" />I think that is true,' the Hajji told him.<Node id="200430" /> '<Node id="200432" />But to-morrow's exists
only in a greater knowledge than ours and it can only be experienced in
that diviner knowledge.<Node id="200550" /> <Node id="200551" />Therefore to experience the future, though not
perhaps to foresee the future, it is necessary to enter the soul of the
world with the inward being.<Node id="200698" />'<Node id="200699" />

<Node id="200701" />'<Node id="200702" />Then Giles did not miss that half-hour?<Node id="200741" />' <Node id="200743" />Lord Arglay said, and
explained the situation.<Node id="200789" /> <Node id="200790" />The Hajji shook his head.<Node id="200815" /> '<Node id="200817" />I think,' he
answered, 'that he has known, in an infinitely small fraction of time,
all his future until he enters the End of Desire.<Node id="200950" />'<Node id="200951" />

<Node id="200953" />'<Node id="200954" />He has foreknown that which he is now experiencing?<Node id="201005" />' <Node id="201007" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="201025" />

<Node id="201027" />'<Node id="201028" />I think so,' Ibrahim answered.<Node id="201058" /> '<Node id="201060" />But though he knew it I do not think
it is now within his memory, nor will be until he reaches the end.<Node id="201163" /> <Node id="201164" />For
to remember the future he must have foreknown his memory of that future,
and yet that he could not do without first foreknowing it without
memory.<Node id="201314" /> <Node id="201315" />So I think he is spared that evil.<Node id="201349" /> <Node id="201350" />Exalted for ever be the Mercy
of the Compassionate!<Node id="201401" />'<Node id="201402" />




<Node id="201407" />CHAPTER VIII<Node id="201419" />

<Node id="201421" />THE CONFERENCE<Node id="201435" />


<Node id="201438" />The room at the Foreign Office was large enough not to be crowded.<Node id="201504" /> <Node id="201505" />Lord
Birlesmere sat in a chair dexterously arranged at the corner of a table,
thus allowing him to control without compelling him to preside.<Node id="201646" /> <Node id="201647" />Next to
him sat Lord Arglay with Chloe by his side; opposite was Mr. Sheldrake
in a state of very bitter irritation.<Node id="201763" /> <Node id="201764" />Reginald Montague was in an equal
state of nervousness next to Chloe.<Node id="201833" /> <Node id="201834" />Mr. Doncaster was next to Sheldrake,
and a little apart were Professor Palliser and Sir Giles Tumulty.<Node id="201936" /> <Node id="201937" />At
the bottom of the table were Mr. Bruce Cumberland and a high police
official.<Node id="202017" /> <Node id="202018" />The Persian Embassy was not represented.<Node id="202058" /> <Node id="202059" />It was about 11
o'clock on Monday.<Node id="202093" />

<Node id="202095" />Lord Birlesmere leant a little forward.<Node id="202134" /> '<Node id="202136" />Gentlemen,' he began, 'you
know, I think, why we have troubled you and why you have consented
to come here.<Node id="202243" /> <Node id="202244" />The very surprising demonstrations at Rich during the
week-end are a matter which do not concern this particular Office,
but--as most of you at any rate know--those demonstrations are said
to be connected with a substance, reputedly a relic, in the existence
and preservation of which a foreign Power has declared itself to be
interested.<Node id="202582" /> <Node id="202583" />I need not detain you now to explain to what extent that
Power's representatives have taken official action.<Node id="202691" /> <Node id="202692" />But I may say, in
passing, that I myself have reason to believe that certain agitations
and disturbances in the Near East during the last two months have the
same cause....<Node id="202864" />'<Node id="202865" />

<Node id="202867" />'<Node id="202868" />What cause?<Node id="202879" />' <Node id="202881" />Mr. Sheldrake interrupted irritably.<Node id="202917" />

<Node id="202919" />'<Node id="202920" />A concern,' Lord Birlesmere flowed on, 'with the existence and disposal
of this hypothetical relic.<Node id="203019" /> <Node id="203020" />I am anxious to discover, on behalf of the
Government, of what nature this is, whether it is one or many, to whom
it now belongs, and in whose possession it now is, and how far the
claims of any foreign Power can be justified.<Node id="203246" /> <Node id="203247" />I need not say that I
and any other representatives of the authorities here will treat every
communication made as confidential, or that if any of you wish to
make a private statement we shall be pleased to give you immediate
opportunities.<Node id="203487" />'<Node id="203488" />

<Node id="203490" />Nobody leapt at the opportunity.<Node id="203522" /> <Node id="203523" />Lord Birlesmere said across the table:
'I believe, Mr. Sheldrake, you claim that this supposed relic belongs to
you?<Node id="203639" />'<Node id="203640" />

<Node id="203642" />'<Node id="203643" />I know nothing whatever about relics,' Sheldrake answered.<Node id="203701" /> '<Node id="203703" />I know that
only last Friday I bought from Mr. Montague a kind of stone which he
assured me could produce certain remarkable results.<Node id="203836" /> <Node id="203837" />I tested his claims
and they seemed justified; and as a result of these tests I gave him my
cheque for seventy-three thousand guineas.<Node id="203971" />'<Node id="203972" />

<Node id="203974" />'<Node id="203975" />Did you understand,' Lord Birlesmere asked, 'that this was the only
stone of its kind in existence?<Node id="204074" />'<Node id="204075" />

<Node id="204077" />'<Node id="204078" />No,' Sheldrake admitted rather reluctantly, 'I understood there were
three or four.<Node id="204161" />'<Node id="204162" />

<Node id="204164" />'<Node id="204165" />And by a series of events this Stone came into the hands of Mr.
Doncaster and thence to the police, performing apparently some
remarkable cures on its way--yes,' Lord Birlesmere said, 'we needn't go
into that now.<Node id="204378" /> <Node id="204379" />Except, Mr. Doncaster, that you think these cures may
really have been produced by the Stone?<Node id="204472" /> <Node id="204473" />Or anyhow,' he added, seeing
that Oliver was prepared to discuss this for a long time, 'you see
nothing against that hypothesis?<Node id="204601" />'<Node id="204602" />

<Node id="204604" />'<Node id="204605" />Well, nothing except----' Oliver began.<Node id="204644" />

<Node id="204646" />'<Node id="204647" />Practically nothing at the moment,' Lord Birlesmere substituted.<Node id="204711" />
'<Node id="204713" />Quite.<Node id="204719" /> <Node id="204720" />Well now, Mr. Montague, would you mind telling us where _you_
got the Stone?<Node id="204796" />'<Node id="204797" />

<Node id="204799" />'<Node id="204800" />My uncle gave it me,' Reginald said very quickly.<Node id="204849" /> '<Node id="204851" />Sir Giles.<Node id="204861" />' <Node id="204863" />He met
Sir Giles's eyes and shivered a little.<Node id="204909" />

<Node id="204911" />Lord Birlesmere, having reached the desired point by a more gentle
method than by mere attack, looked at Sir Giles with an engaging smile.<Node id="205049" />
'<Node id="205051" />I wonder whether you would mind telling us exactly what you know about
the Stone, Sir Giles,' he said.<Node id="205153" />

<Node id="205155" />'<Node id="205156" />I don't _mind_ telling you,' Sir Giles said, 'but I'm damned if I see
why I should.<Node id="205239" /> <Node id="205240" />Why on earth should I tell this private detective agency
everything about my personal affairs, because an auriferous Yankee loses
his purse?<Node id="205380" />'<Node id="205381" />

<Node id="205383" />Lord Arglay observed round the table a slight perplexity, except where
Mr. Sheldrake jerked upright and Reginald stared downwards.<Node id="205513" /> <Node id="205514" />In an
undertone to Chloe he said: 'I don't really know why he should, do you?<Node id="205591" />'
<Node id="205593" />But Chloe was looking, rather inimically for her, at Sir Giles.<Node id="205656" />

<Node id="205658" />Lord Birlesmere glanced at Bruce Cumberland, who said: 'Merely as a
friendly act, Sir Giles, you might be willing to assist the inquiry.<Node id="205794" />'<Node id="205795" />

<Node id="205797" />'<Node id="205798" />But in the first place,' Sir Giles answered, 'I don't see any friends
here--except perhaps the Professor, and secondly, I don't know what I've
got to do with the inquiry.<Node id="205968" /> <Node id="205969" />Whoever's been curing the village idiots of
England it isn't me.<Node id="206033" /> <Node id="206034" />I've got something else to do than to cure old
women of paralytic delirium.<Node id="206109" />'<Node id="206110" />

<Node id="206112" />'<Node id="206113" />The properties of the Stone...<Node id="206143" />' <Node id="206145" />Mr. Cumberland began again.<Node id="206172" />

<Node id="206174" />'<Node id="206175" />The properties of the Stone,' Sir Giles interrupted, 'are for
scientists to determine--not politicians, policemen, and prostitutes.<Node id="206306" />'<Node id="206307" />

<Node id="206309" />Mr.<Node id="206312" /> <Node id="206313" />Sheldrake jerked again, and kept his eyes away from Chloe with an
effort.<Node id="206386" /> <Node id="206387" />So did everyone else, except Lord Arglay who smiled at her and
then looked at Lord Birlesmere.<Node id="206481" /> <Node id="206482" />The Foreign Secretary, caught between
ignoring the word and thus appearing to allow it and protesting and thus
permitting the whole conversation to wander off on to a useless path,
said in a perfectly audible voice to Mr. Sheldrake: 'Sir Giles, like
other great men, is a little eccentric in his phrases sometimes,' but
Sir Giles refused to be excused.<Node id="206834" />

<Node id="206836" />'<Node id="206837" />Well, I suppose the Foreign Secretary _is_ a politician,' he said, 'and
a Scotland Yard Commissioner _is_ a policeman.<Node id="206955" /> <Node id="206956" />Eh?<Node id="206959" /> <Node id="206960" />Very well then----!<Node id="206979" />'<Node id="206980" />

<Node id="206982" />Bruce Cumberland leaned across towards the Chief Justice.<Node id="207039" /> '<Node id="207041" />Perhaps,' he
said in a hoarse whisper, 'Miss Burnett would like to withdraw.<Node id="207117" /> <Node id="207118" />I mean,
you see....<Node id="207137" />'<Node id="207138" />

<Node id="207140" />Chloe's hand touched Lord Arglay's arm.<Node id="207179" /> '<Node id="207181" />Don't make me go,' she breathed
to him.<Node id="207220" />

<Node id="207222" />'<Node id="207223" />Ah,' Lord Birlesmere said, delighted at the suggestion, 'now if in
the unusual circumstances Miss Burnett would oblige me personally by
rendering the inquiry easier....<Node id="207391" /> <Node id="207392" />We want,' he went on rather vaguely,
'to have no restraints imposed, though if the matter were less urgent...<Node id="207501" />'<Node id="207502" />

<Node id="207504" />'<Node id="207505" />My dear Birlesmere,' Arglay said patiently, 'neither Miss Burnett nor
I have the least objection to Sir Giles using any language he finds
congenial.<Node id="207653" /> <Node id="207654" />We haven't even a police-court acquittal against us, and any
apology seems to me to be chiefly due to the English language which is
being wildly misused.<Node id="207807" /> <Node id="207808" />Pray consider our feelings unruffled.<Node id="207845" />'<Node id="207846" />

<Node id="207848" />'<Node id="207849" />Very good of you,' Lord Birlesmere, rather perplexed, murmured, and
returned to Sir Giles who was feeling in a waistcoat pocket and snarling
at the Chief Justice.<Node id="208011" /> '<Node id="208013" />The point is, Sir Giles,' he said, 'that it is
necessary for the Government to know, first, what justification there is
for foreign claims to the Stone; secondly, what properties the Stone
possesses; and thirdly, how many there are in existence.<Node id="208258" />'<Node id="208259" />

<Node id="208261" />'<Node id="208262" />The answers,' Tumulty said, 'are that no foreign claim to the Stone
has any validity, that Professor Palliser and I are at work on an
investigation of its qualities, and that I cannot tell you how many
stones exist for a reason I can show you.<Node id="208505" />' <Node id="208507" />He felt in his pocket again.<Node id="208535" />

<Node id="208537" />'<Node id="208538" />The qualities,' Lord Birlesmere said, 'are said to include rapid
transit through space and singular curative powers.<Node id="208654" />'<Node id="208655" />

<Node id="208657" />'<Node id="208658" />Transit through _time_ and space,' Sir Giles corrected him.<Node id="208717" /> '<Node id="208719" />Two
hundred miles or two hundred hours.<Node id="208758" />' <Node id="208760" />He pushed his chair a little away
from the table and set another--his own--Stone on his knee.<Node id="208853" /> '<Node id="208855" />Don't crowd
me, gentlemen,' he went on, 'or I shall have to remove myself at once.<Node id="208937" />
<Node id="208938" />This is not the Stone Mr. Sheldrake flung away.<Node id="208985" />'<Node id="208986" />

<Node id="208988" />'<Node id="208989" />Like the poor Indian,' Oliver Doncaster put in, being a little tired
of having no chance to say anything, but no one took any notice except
the Chief Justice who, glancing at Sheldrake, altered Shakespeare into
Pope by murmuring 'whose untutored mind.<Node id="209240" />'<Node id="209241" />

<Node id="209243" />'<Node id="209244" />If the Government,' Sir Giles went on, 'wish to conduct an inquiry into
the nature of the Stone I shall be happy to assist them by supplying
examples.<Node id="209394" />' <Node id="209396" />He covered the Stone on his knee with both hands and
apparently in some intense effort shut his eyes for a minute or two.<Node id="209517" /> <Node id="209518" />The
inquiry looked perplexed and doubtful, and it was Chloe who suddenly
broke the silence by jumping to her feet and running round the table.<Node id="209660" />
<Node id="209661" />Sir Giles, hearing the movement, opened his eyes just as Palliser thrust
his chair back in Chloe's path, and leapt up in his turn, throwing as
he did so about a dozen Stones, all exactly similar, on to the table.<Node id="209873" />
<Node id="209874" />Everybody jumped up in confusion, as Chloe, still silent, caught
Palliser's chair with a vicious jerk that unbalanced and overthrew the
Professor, and sprang towards Tumulty.<Node id="210048" /> <Node id="210049" />Sir Giles, the Stone clasped in
one hand and his open knife still in the other, met her with a snarl.<Node id="210150" />
'<Node id="210152" />Go to hell,' he said, and slashed out with the knife as she caught at
his wrist.<Node id="210232" />

<Node id="210234" />'<Node id="210235" />Miss Burnett!<Node id="210248" /> <Node id="210249" />Miss Burnett!<Node id="210262" />' <Node id="210264" />half the table cried.<Node id="210285" /> '<Node id="210287" />Miss Burnett!<Node id="210300" /> <Node id="210301" />Sir
Giles!<Node id="210311" />' <Node id="210313" />Lord Birlesmere exclaimed.<Node id="210339" /> <Node id="210340" />Mr. Sheldrake, his mouth open in
dismay, caught up two or three of the Stones and looked at them.<Node id="210437" /> <Node id="210438" />Lord
Arglay, leaning over the table, struck Doncaster's shoulder sharply:
'Get that knife away from him,' he said, and himself ran round after
Chloe.<Node id="210587" /> <Node id="210588" />Palliser, scrambling to his feet, thrust himself in Doncaster's
way.<Node id="210656" /> '<Node id="210658" />Lord Birlesmere,' he called.<Node id="210686" /> '<Node id="210688" />I protest!<Node id="210698" /> <Node id="210699" />I demand that you shall
stop this attack.<Node id="210740" />'<Node id="210741" />

<Node id="210743" />'<Node id="210744" />Get out, you----' Sir Giles yelled at Chloe.<Node id="210788" /> <Node id="210789" />The knife had shut on her
fingers and blood was on her hand.<Node id="210849" /> <Node id="210850" />But her other had already caught
Tumulty's wrist and was struggling with his for the Stone.<Node id="210941" /> <Node id="210942" />Lord Arglay's
arrival did not seem materially to help her; it was Tumulty, who, as
everyone rushed to do something to end the scuffle, let go of the Stone,
slipped to one side, reached the table, and caught up one or two of the
Types which, to the Chief Justice's hasty glance, seemed to cover it.<Node id="211239" />
<Node id="211240" />There were by now half a dozen bodies between Chloe and Sir Giles, who
however had only distanced a foe to meet a fidget.<Node id="211361" /> <Node id="211362" />Sheldrake clutched
at him.<Node id="211388" /> '<Node id="211390" />What are you doing?<Node id="211409" />' <Node id="211411" />he shrieked.<Node id="211423" /> '<Node id="211425" />What are you doing with my
stone?<Node id="211458" />'<Node id="211459" />

<Node id="211461" />'<Node id="211462" />Lord Birlesmere,' Sir Giles said, 'unless you stop that hell-cat of
Arglay's I'll ruin everything.<Node id="211560" /> <Node id="211561" />I'll go off and flood the country with
Stones.<Node id="211607" /> <Node id="211608" />I can and I will.<Node id="211625" />'<Node id="211626" />

<Node id="211628" />Lord Birlesmere said passionately, 'Miss Burnett, please be quiet.<Node id="211694" /> <Node id="211695" />You'd
better go; you'd really better go.<Node id="211735" />'<Node id="211736" />

<Node id="211738" />The Chief Justice gave Chloe a handkerchief.<Node id="211782" /> '<Node id="211784" />You attend to Tumulty,
Birlesmere,' he said.<Node id="211828" /> '<Node id="211830" />The real proceedings are only just beginning.<Node id="211875" /> <Node id="211876" />All
mankind has been searching for this Stone, and now the English
Government has got it.<Node id="211965" />'<Node id="211966" />

<Node id="211968" />Lord Birlesmere came back to the table and stood by Sir Giles.<Node id="212030" /> '<Node id="212032" />What
does it _mean_?<Node id="212052" />' <Node id="212054" />he said.<Node id="212062" />

<Node id="212064" />'<Node id="212065" />I will tell you now,' Tumulty answered.<Node id="212104" /> '<Node id="212106" />Anyone who has this Stone can
heal himself of all illnesses, and can move at once through space and
time, and can multiply it by dividing it as much as he wishes.<Node id="212268" /> <Node id="212269" />There
will be no need of doctors or nurses or railways or tubes or trams or
taxis or airships or any transport--except for heavy luggage, and I'm
not sure about that--_if_ I scatter this Stone through the country.<Node id="212482" />
<Node id="212483" />How do you like the idea?<Node id="212508" /> <Node id="212509" />Look,' he said, 'I'll show you.<Node id="212540" /> <Node id="212541" />Will to be
somewhere--in Westminster Abbey.<Node id="212584" />' <Node id="212586" />He thrust one of the Types into the
Foreign Secretary's hand, who took it, looked at it, looked at Sir
Giles, hesitated, then seemed to concentrate--and suddenly neither he
nor Tumulty were there.<Node id="212782" />

<Node id="212784" />As the others jumped and gaped Arglay said to Chloe, 'You can't do any
more.<Node id="212860" /> <Node id="212861" />They have it here.<Node id="212879" /> <Node id="212880" />Go back home and wait for me.<Node id="212909" />'<Node id="212910" />

<Node id="212912" />'<Node id="212913" />I suppose I was a fool,' Chloe said in a low tone.<Node id="212963" /> '<Node id="212965" />But I did so hate
to see him sitting there, and _know_ what he was doing.<Node id="213038" /> <Node id="213039" />And if I'd
screamed at them no one would have done anything.<Node id="213099" />'<Node id="213100" />

<Node id="213102" />Arglay nodded.<Node id="213116" /> '<Node id="213118" />It is clear,' he began, 'that here--no, never mind.<Node id="213169" /> <Node id="213170" />I'll
tell you presently.<Node id="213194" /> <Node id="213195" />Wait.<Node id="213200" />' <Node id="213202" />He stepped to the table and picked up one of
the Types.<Node id="213257" /> <Node id="213258" />Mr. Bruce Cumberland began to say something.<Node id="213302" /> <Node id="213303" />Lord Arglay
looked at him and went back to Chloe.<Node id="213352" /> '<Node id="213354" />Take this,' he said.<Node id="213374" /> '<Node id="213376" />No, take
it.<Node id="213388" /> <Node id="213389" />Thrice is he armed, of course, but I would rather you could come to
me.<Node id="213460" />'<Node id="213461" />

<Node id="213463" />'<Node id="213464" />I don't like to touch it,' Chloe looked at it in a kind of awe.<Node id="213527" />

<Node id="213529" />'<Node id="213530" />To the pure all things are pure, even purity,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="213594" /> '<Node id="213596" />Take
it, child.<Node id="213611" /> <Node id="213612" />And keep it near you, for I do not think we know what may
happen, but I think the Stone is on your side.<Node id="213716" />'<Node id="213717" />

<Node id="213719" />'<Node id="213720" />What do you mean?<Node id="213737" />' <Node id="213739" />Chloe asked.<Node id="213751" /> '<Node id="213753" />On our side?<Node id="213765" />'<Node id="213766" />

<Node id="213768" />'<Node id="213769" />I haven't an idea,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="213810" /> '<Node id="213812" />But I think so.<Node id="213827" /> <Node id="213828" />Now go.<Node id="213835" /> <Node id="213836" />Go
to Lancaster Gate and wait for me.<Node id="213873" /> <Node id="213874" />Go before the Foreign Secretary and
that Gadarene swine return.<Node id="213937" />' <Node id="213939" />He took her to the door, and as he returned
was met by Mr. Bruce Cumberland.<Node id="214015" />

<Node id="214017" />'<Node id="214018" />Has Miss Burnett gone?<Node id="214040" />' <Node id="214042" />the secretary said.<Node id="214061" /> '<Node id="214063" />I don't know whether Lord
Birlesmere might not want her not to go before----'<Node id="214140" />

<Node id="214142" />'<Node id="214143" />My dear Mr. Cumberland,' the Chief Justice said, 'your certainties are
as mixed as your negatives.<Node id="214241" /> <Node id="214242" />Hasn't Lord Birlesmere been asking her to go
in every kind of voice?<Node id="214310" /> <Node id="214311" />And now I've urged her to, just to please him.<Node id="214357" />
<Node id="214358" />And you're still not happy.<Node id="214385" /> <Node id="214386" />How difficult you diplomats are!<Node id="214418" />'<Node id="214419" />

<Node id="214421" />'<Node id="214422" />But she took one of the Stones,' Bruce Cumberland protested.<Node id="214482" />

<Node id="214484" />'<Node id="214485" />Well,' Lord Arglay said, sitting down leisurely, 'I can easily make you
another--ten, twenty more.<Node id="214583" /> <Node id="214584" />At least, I can't, because I don't want to
annoy Suleiman ben Daood--on whom be the Peace!<Node id="214674" /> <Node id="214675" />as my friend the Hajji
would say.<Node id="214708" /> <Node id="214709" />If it belongs to him.<Node id="214730" /> <Node id="214731" />But you can make them for yourself.<Node id="214766" />
<Node id="214767" />What a time Giles is, showing Birlesmere the tombs in Westminster
Abbey!<Node id="214839" />'<Node id="214840" />

<Node id="214842" />Bruce Cumberland gave up the argument and they waited in silence for
the return of the others.<Node id="214936" /> <Node id="214937" />When this took place Sir Giles, with a glance
round the room and a triumphant grin at Arglay, flung himself into a
chair.<Node id="215058" /> <Node id="215059" />Lord Birlesmere stood leaning on the table for some time.<Node id="215116" /> <Node id="215117" />Then he
said: 'I think, gentlemen, there is nothing more that can profitably be
done now.<Node id="215206" /> <Node id="215207" />I am very much obliged to all of you.<Node id="215244" />' <Node id="215246" />He paused, bowed, added
something in a low voice to Mr. Sheldrake, and sat down.<Node id="215326" /> <Node id="215327" />The American
did the same thing.<Node id="215359" /> <Node id="215360" />Lord Arglay watched thoughtfully till the others
had withdrawn, and Lord Birlesmere was looking at him restlessly.<Node id="215474" /> <Node id="215475" />He
considered for a moment the three opposite him, and said quietly.<Node id="215543" /> '<Node id="215545" />No,
Birlesmere; you're like Salisbury, you're backing the wrong horse.<Node id="215615" /> <Node id="215616" />And
if Mr. Sheldrake wants to get his seventy thousand pounds restored I
think that he's riding the wrong way.<Node id="215726" /> <Node id="215727" />As for you, Tumulty, I don't think
you know where you're riding.<Node id="215791" />' <Node id="215793" />He got up and strolled slowly to the
door.<Node id="215835" />

<Node id="215837" />The important conference now began.<Node id="215872" /> <Node id="215873" />That Sir Giles was a member of it
was due largely to the importance he seemed to have as the origin and
scientific investigator of the Stone rather than to any actual need of
him.<Node id="216052" /> <Node id="216053" />But his impatience prevented a good deal of time being lost in an
international wrangle, since neither Birlesmere nor Sheldrake wished
more Types to exist than could be helped, while Tumulty was entirely
reckless.<Node id="216266" /> <Node id="216267" />All that he wanted was opportunity to investigate the
qualities of the Stone, without exposing himself to any serious risk
of unexpected results; and this he saw a chance of obtaining by an
understanding with the Government.<Node id="216491" /> <Node id="216492" />But to both of the others the
monopoly of the Stone was rapidly becoming a matter of the first
importance, and under pressure from Sir Giles something very like the
first draft of a new Anglo-American treaty was reached in half an hour
or so.<Node id="216734" /> <Node id="216735" />Sheldrake had vague personal and semi-official relations with
the President, and promised to bring the whole thing privately to
his notice.<Node id="216874" /> <Node id="216875" />With instruments of this nature at their disposal, and
a judicious use of them, he and the Foreign Secretary saw infinite
possibilities of developing power.<Node id="217031" /> <Node id="217032" />Only one thing stood in their way,
and it was this hindrance they were anxious for Sir Giles to remove.<Node id="217135" />
<Node id="217136" />At present the successful use of the Stone depended entirely on the
individual will.<Node id="217220" /> <Node id="217221" />But for purposes of national control, it was necessary
that the controllers should be able to move masses of men without
the masses having a choice.<Node id="217369" /> <Node id="217370" />It was clear that no army which had been
supplied with Types of the Stone could be relied on.<Node id="217463" /> <Node id="217464" />Mutiny might be
dangerous but transit of this sort would be safe and easy.<Node id="217538" /> <Node id="217539" />For the first
time in history the weakest thing was on a level, was indeed better off,
than the strongest.<Node id="217645" /> <Node id="217646" />Besides, as Sir Giles with a certain glee pointed
out, in war nothing but mortal wounds would be any use; others could
be healed at once, and wars would become interminable.<Node id="217819" /> <Node id="217820" />It was Lord
Birlesmere who asked whether, if the Stone could heal so easily, it
could also repair wastage; that is, prove a substitute for food.<Node id="217964" /> '<Node id="217966" />But
then,' he added, startled, 'it would practically confer immortality.<Node id="218038" /> <Node id="218039" />The
world would in time become over-crowded; you would be adding without
taking away.<Node id="218124" />'<Node id="218125" />

<Node id="218127" />'<Node id="218128" />You might,' Sir Giles said, 'use it as the perfect contraceptive.<Node id="218193" />'<Node id="218194" />

<Node id="218196" />Mr.<Node id="218199" /> <Node id="218200" />Sheldrake looked down his nose.<Node id="218231" /> <Node id="218232" />The conversation seemed to him to be
becoming obscene.<Node id="218286" />

<Node id="218288" />'<Node id="218289" />Under control,' Lord Birlesmere said thoughtfully, 'always, always
under control.<Node id="218370" /> <Node id="218371" />We _must_ find out what it can do; you must, Sir Giles.<Node id="218426" />'<Node id="218427" />

<Node id="218429" />'<Node id="218430" />I ask nothing better,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="218468" /> '<Node id="218470" />But you Puritans have always
made such a fuss about vivisection, let alone human vivisection.<Node id="218563" />'<Node id="218564" />

<Node id="218566" />'<Node id="218567" />No one,' Lord Birlesmere exclaimed, 'is suggesting vivisection.<Node id="218630" /> <Node id="218631" />There
is a difference between harmless experiments and vivisection.<Node id="218698" />'<Node id="218699" />

<Node id="218701" />'<Node id="218702" />I can have living bodies?<Node id="218727" />' <Node id="218729" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="218745" />

<Node id="218747" />'<Node id="218748" />Well, there are prisons--and workhouses--and hospitals--and barracks,'
Birlesmere answered slowly.<Node id="218846" /> '<Node id="218848" />Judiciously, of course.<Node id="218871" /> <Node id="218872" />I mean, a careful
investigation of the possibilities.<Node id="218925" />' <Node id="218927" />He was distracted by Mr. Sheldrake's
clamour for a licensed monopoly of the Stone for use in transit.<Node id="219028" />

<Node id="219030" />It took longer to satisfy the American than the scientist.<Node id="219088" /> <Node id="219089" />Lord
Birlesmere was perfectly willing to give up bodies to experiment, so far
as he could, but he was very reluctant to interfere with the right of
any citizen into whose possession the Stone might come, to use it as he
chose.<Node id="219315" /> <Node id="219316" />Yet nothing else, it was clear, would be of any use.<Node id="219368" />

<Node id="219370" />The possession of the Stone would have to be made illegal.<Node id="219428" /> <Node id="219429" />And therefore
the Types would have to be recovered.<Node id="219480" /> <Node id="219481" />Of such Types, besides those on
the table, there were at least four--Professor Palliser had one ('I'll
answer for him,' Sir Giles said), Reginald Montague ('and you can deal
with him,' he added, 'frightening him will do it'), Lord Arglay, and
Miss Burnett.<Node id="219737" />

<Node id="219739" />They looked at each other.<Node id="219765" /> <Node id="219766" />It might be rather a difficult thing to
persuade the Chief Justice to give up anything he had a right to possess
and an interest in keeping.<Node id="219906" />

<Node id="219908" />'<Node id="219909" />What about a secret Order in Council?<Node id="219946" />' <Node id="219948" />Sheldrake soared to new heights
of romanticism.<Node id="219995" />

<Node id="219997" />'<Node id="219998" />I don't know the legal aspect,' Birlesmere muttered.<Node id="220050" /> '<Node id="220052" />And he probably
would.<Node id="220074" /> <Node id="220075" />The English law is a difficult study, my dear Mr. Sheldrake, and
Lord Arglay would probably know a good deal about it.<Node id="220193" /> <Node id="220194" />I might consult
the Law Officers--but even then--and Miss Burnett too.<Node id="220264" /> <Node id="220265" />Being his
secretary makes it so awkward....<Node id="220308" />'<Node id="220309" />

<Node id="220311" />There was a prolonged silence.<Node id="220341" /> <Node id="220342" />Then Sir Giles said suddenly: 'What about
this foreign Power of yours?<Node id="220412" />'<Node id="220413" />

<Node id="220415" />'<Node id="220416" />What about it?<Node id="220430" />' <Node id="220432" />Birlesmere asked in surprise.<Node id="220461" />

<Node id="220463" />'<Node id="220464" />Persia, wasn't it?<Node id="220482" />' <Node id="220484" />Sir Giles said.<Node id="220499" /> '<Node id="220501" />I had some carpet-weaver of
theirs to dinner to find out about the Stone.<Node id="220574" /> <Node id="220575" />And if they burgled
me--and I'm almost sure they did--what about a neat little burglary at
Lancaster Gate?<Node id="220681" /> <Node id="220682" />And at--where does that girl live?<Node id="220716" />'<Node id="220717" />

<Node id="220719" />Birlesmere shook his head.<Node id="220745" /> '<Node id="220747" />It means them getting the Stone,' he
objected, 'and I'd much rather Arglay had it.<Node id="220829" /> <Node id="220830" />Well, I'll think about
it.<Node id="220856" /> <Node id="220857" />Perhaps a friendly appeal----'<Node id="220887" />

<Node id="220889" />Sir Giles made a peculiar noise and rather reluctantly abandoned the
subject.<Node id="220966" /> <Node id="220967" />He disliked any Types being in Arglay's and Chloe's possession,
but his dislike was not strong enough to urge him to extreme action.<Node id="221099" /> <Node id="221100" />But
as, a little later, a temporary agreement having been arrived at, he
left the Foreign Office, it occurred to him that if the Stone had shown
his own action to the Chief Justice, it could be used also to discover
what was in Arglay's mind, and to suggest other modes of action.<Node id="221380" /> <Node id="221381" />With
this idea possessing him he rejoined Palliser, who was staying at
Ealing.<Node id="221459" />




<Node id="221464" />CHAPTER IX<Node id="221474" />

<Node id="221476" />THE ACTION OF LORD ARGLAY<Node id="221501" />


<Node id="221504" />Lord Arglay, insisting on writing some business letters after lunch,
insisted also that Chloe should wait his convenience and rest until he
was ready for her.<Node id="221662" /> <Node id="221663" />It was consequently not until after tea that he
lit one of his very occasional cigars, and standing in front of the
fireplace said: 'And now, Miss Burnett, what do you make of it?<Node id="221842" />'<Node id="221843" />

<Node id="221845" />'<Node id="221846" />I feel an awful ass,' Chloe told him, 'going for Sir Giles like that.<Node id="221915" />
<Node id="221916" />But I couldn't think of anything sane to do--I was so angry.<Node id="221976" />'<Node id="221977" />

<Node id="221979" />'<Node id="221980" />The wrath of the Lamb,' Arglay said.<Node id="222016" /> '<Node id="222018" />But I didn't mean about yourself;
you saved the Lord Chief Justice throwing an inkstand at Giles, which
would have been more scandalous, but perhaps more effective, if I had
hit him.<Node id="222200" /> <Node id="222201" />It might even have killed him.<Node id="222231" /> <Node id="222232" />I really meant--about the
situation.<Node id="222268" /> <Node id="222269" />Suppress, if you can, your righteous supernatural anger
with him, and tell me why you hate him so.<Node id="222367" />'<Node id="222368" />

<Node id="222370" />'<Node id="222371" />I _don't_ hate him,' Chloe said.<Node id="222403" /> '<Node id="222405" />I only want to stop him doing
anything at all with the Stone.<Node id="222466" /> <Node id="222467" />He oughtn't to have it.<Node id="222490" />'<Node id="222491" />

<Node id="222493" />'<Node id="222494" />So far as we know, he bought it,' Lord Arglay pointed out.<Node id="222552" />

<Node id="222554" />'<Node id="222555" />But it isn't _his_,' Chloe pleaded, 'not really.<Node id="222603" />'<Node id="222604" />

<Node id="222606" />'<Node id="222607" />Mrs.<Node id="222611" /> <Node id="222612" />Sheldrake used much the same argument to convince me that _all_
the Types ought to be her husband's,' Arglay answered.<Node id="222730" /> '<Node id="222732" />Only she said,
they _are_ his, really.<Node id="222770" /> <Node id="222771" />Try and be masculine and rational.<Node id="222805" /> _<Node id="222807" />Why_ isn't
it his?<Node id="222825" />'<Node id="222826" />

<Node id="222828" />Chloe made an obviously intense effort.<Node id="222867" /> '<Node id="222869" />I think I hate the way he looks
at it,' she said.<Node id="222918" /> '<Node id="222920" />He doesn't care about _it_, only about the way it
works.<Node id="222976" /> <Node id="222977" />He doesn't care about Suleiman--or Charlemagne--or....<Node id="223031" /> <Node id="223032" />He only
wants to see what it will do.<Node id="223069" />'<Node id="223070" />

<Node id="223072" />'<Node id="223073" />And being an incurable romantic,' Arglay said, 'you hate him being
merely utilitarian.<Node id="223159" /> <Node id="223160" />Well, I don't suppose anyone else, for a thousand
years or so, has barked their knuckles for the sake of Suleiman the
King.<Node id="223283" /> <Node id="223284" />I should think you were the first of the English to do it.<Node id="223342" />
<Node id="223343" />Still--it's hardly reason enough for your disliking Giles quite so
much.<Node id="223415" />'<Node id="223416" />

<Node id="223418" />Chloe went on looking for reasons.<Node id="223452" /> '<Node id="223454" />He doesn't _care_ about it a bit,'
she protested.<Node id="223503" /> '<Node id="223505" />He throws it about as if it were of no importance at
all.<Node id="223562" /> <Node id="223563" />And he doesn't care how much he cuts it up.<Node id="223606" />'<Node id="223607" />

<Node id="223609" />'<Node id="223610" />And why do we care?<Node id="223629" />' <Node id="223631" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="223649" />

<Node id="223651" />Chloe smiled.<Node id="223664" /> '<Node id="223666" />I don't know,' she said, 'I don't know a bit, but I do.<Node id="223721" />
<Node id="223722" />Don't you know?<Node id="223737" />'<Node id="223738" />

<Node id="223740" />The Chief Justice frowned at his cigar.<Node id="223779" /> '<Node id="223781" />I will offer you two
alternatives,' he said.<Node id="223825" /> '<Node id="223827" />First, we are both disgracefully sentimental.<Node id="223872" />
<Node id="223873" />We wallow in tradition.<Node id="223896" /> <Node id="223897" />And when a traditional thing appears to produce
unusual results we can't help being affected.<Node id="223990" /> <Node id="223991" />Giles is stronger-minded.<Node id="224016" />
<Node id="224017" />Suleiman and our lord the Prophet leave him unmoved.<Node id="224069" /> _<Node id="224071" />J'y suis, j'y
reste_, and so on.<Node id="224103" /> <Node id="224104" />I hate being less efficient than Giles, but I fear
it, I promise you I fear it.<Node id="224183" />' <Node id="224185" />He shook his head despairingly.<Node id="224216" />

<Node id="224218" />'<Node id="224219" />And the other alternative?<Node id="224245" />' <Node id="224247" />Chloe said.<Node id="224258" />

<Node id="224260" />'<Node id="224261" />The other?<Node id="224271" /> <Node id="224272" />O the other is that we're right in being affected,' Lord
Arglay answered, 'that amid all this mess of myths and tangle of
traditions and ...<Node id="224412" /> <Node id="224413" />and ...<Node id="224420" /> <Node id="224421" />febrifuge of fables, there is something
extreme and terrible.<Node id="224482" /> <Node id="224483" />And if so, Giles had better be careful.<Node id="224522" />'<Node id="224523" />

<Node id="224525" />'<Node id="224526" />Which do you believe?<Node id="224547" />' <Node id="224549" />Chloe asked.<Node id="224561" />

<Node id="224563" />'<Node id="224564" />My dear girl, I haven't a notion,' the Chief Justice told her.<Node id="224626" /> '<Node id="224628" />I don't
see a little bit how we can decide.<Node id="224671" /> <Node id="224672" />It's a question--let's be perfectly
frank--of which we want to believe.<Node id="224743" />'<Node id="224744" />

<Node id="224746" />'<Node id="224747" />Which do you then?<Node id="224765" />' <Node id="224767" />Chloe persisted.<Node id="224783" />

<Node id="224785" />'<Node id="224786" />I don't want to believe either.<Node id="224817" /> <Node id="224818" />I hate being foolish and I dislike
being pious,' Arglay said.<Node id="224879" /> '<Node id="224881" />Do you choose first.<Node id="224901" /> <Node id="224902" />How will you know and
receive the Stone?<Node id="224942" />'<Node id="224943" />

<Node id="224945" />'<Node id="224946" />He said it was the End of Desire,' Chloe murmured.<Node id="224996" />

<Node id="224998" />'<Node id="224999" />And shall that be romance or truth for you?<Node id="225042" />' <Node id="225044" />Arglay asked.<Node id="225057" /> '<Node id="225059" />Make up
your mind and tell me, child; what will you have the Stone to be?<Node id="225132" />'<Node id="225133" />

<Node id="225135" />'<Node id="225136" />I would have it to be the End of Desire indeed,' Chloe said.<Node id="225196" /> '<Node id="225198" />I would
have it to be something very strong and--satisfying.<Node id="225258" /> <Node id="225259" />I am afraid of it
but I--don't laugh--I love it.<Node id="225307" />'<Node id="225308" />

<Node id="225310" />Lord Arglay looked at her thoughtfully.<Node id="225349" /> <Node id="225350" />Then, 'Do you believe in God?<Node id="225379" />'
<Node id="225381" />he asked.<Node id="225390" />

<Node id="225392" />'<Node id="225393" />I suppose so,' Chloe said, 'I think I do when I look at the Stone.<Node id="225459" /> <Node id="225460" />But
otherwise--I don't know.<Node id="225488" />'<Node id="225489" />

<Node id="225491" />'<Node id="225492" />Well,' said Lord Arglay, 'I will make you a fair proposal--I will if
you will.<Node id="225570" /> <Node id="225571" />It's all perfectly ridiculous, but since I saw those people
this morning I feel I must be with them or against them.<Node id="225687" /> <Node id="225688" />So I suppose
I'm against them.<Node id="225718" /> <Node id="225719" />Not, mind you, on the evidence.<Node id="225750" /> <Node id="225751" />But I refuse to let
you believe in God all by yourself.<Node id="225806" />'<Node id="225807" />

<Node id="225809" />Chloe looked up at him, her eyes shining.<Node id="225850" /> '<Node id="225852" />But dare I believe that the
Stone is of God?<Node id="225896" />' <Node id="225898" />she said.<Node id="225907" /> '<Node id="225909" />And what do I mean by God--except...<Node id="225945" />' <Node id="225947" />she
half added and stopped.<Node id="225974" />

<Node id="225976" />'<Node id="225977" />Except----?<Node id="225988" />' <Node id="225990" />Arglay asked, but she silently refused to go on and he
said: 'If you will believe this way, then I also will believe.<Node id="226107" /> <Node id="226108" />And we
will set ourselves against the world, the flesh, and the devil, and not
sit in the seat of Giles Tumulty.<Node id="226220" /> <Node id="226221" />But I would have you be careful there
for I think he hates you.<Node id="226284" />'<Node id="226285" />

<Node id="226287" />'<Node id="226288" />But what can he do?<Node id="226307" />' <Node id="226309" />Chloe asked in astonishment.<Node id="226337" />

<Node id="226339" />'<Node id="226340" />If I have seen his mind, as I believe I did,' Lord Arglay said, 'he may
also see yours.<Node id="226427" /> <Node id="226428" />Unless the Stone has varying powers.<Node id="226464" /> <Node id="226465" />I would have you
consider very closely in what way you may work with the Stone for God.<Node id="226552" />
<Node id="226553" />Also I would have you keep it on you day and night that you may escape
by it if need be.<Node id="226641" />'<Node id="226642" />

<Node id="226644" />'<Node id="226645" />But what need can there be?<Node id="226672" />' <Node id="226674" />Chloe asked.<Node id="226686" />

<Node id="226688" />'<Node id="226689" />Child,' Lord Arglay answered, 'it is clear that these men cannot stop
where they are.<Node id="226774" /> <Node id="226775" />They must either abandon the Stone to chance and itself
or they must seek to possess it.<Node id="226863" /> <Node id="226864" />Now I do not think it is well that they
should wholly possess it, and I think that you and I should keep our
Types while we can.<Node id="226992" /> <Node id="226993" />I do not know whether the Types can be united, but
if I were Birlesmere I would strive for that, and the united Stone would
give sole power.<Node id="227133" /> <Node id="227134" />If this is what he does they may attempt anything
within or without the Law.<Node id="227210" /> <Node id="227211" />Fortunately,' he added pensively, 'the
interpretation of the law so often depends on the Courts.<Node id="227307" /> <Node id="227308" />To-morrow I
will talk to the Hajji.<Node id="227343" />'<Node id="227344" />

<Node id="227346" />'<Node id="227347" />But what will you do with it in the end?<Node id="227387" />' <Node id="227389" />Chloe asked.<Node id="227401" />

<Node id="227403" />'<Node id="227404" />Why, that we shall see,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="227446" /> '<Node id="227448" />For the Law is greater
than the Courts, and in the end the Courts shall submit to the Law.<Node id="227538" /> <Node id="227539" />But
meanwhile you shall consider how you will follow this God that we have
decided to believe in, who, it seems, may give wisdom through the Stone.<Node id="227686" />
<Node id="227687" />And then we will free Giles's prisoner in the past.<Node id="227738" />' <Node id="227740" />He paused and
considered Chloe with an anxious protectiveness.<Node id="227802" /> '<Node id="227804" />But if you need me,'
he said, 'come to me at any hour of the day or night.<Node id="227878" />'<Node id="227879" />

<Node id="227881" />Chloe met his eyes gravely.<Node id="227908" /> '<Node id="227910" />I will remember,' she said, 'and--and I do
believe in God.<Node id="227968" />'<Node id="227969" />

<Node id="227971" />'<Node id="227972" />In spite of the fact that Giles Tumulty exists, so do I,' Lord Arglay
said, 'though in a man of past fifty it's either an imbecility or a
heroism.<Node id="228118" />'<Node id="228119" />

<Node id="228121" />'<Node id="228122" />And what for a girl of twenty-five?<Node id="228157" />' <Node id="228159" />Chloe asked.<Node id="228171" />

<Node id="228173" />'<Node id="228174" />O in her it's either a duty or a generosity,' Lord Arglay said, 'but
for a secretary it's a safeguard.<Node id="228276" /> <Node id="228277" />One must have something to explain or
counter-balance one's employer!<Node id="228346" />...'<Node id="228350" />

       <Node id="228359" />*       *       *       *       *<Node id="228392" />

<Node id="228394" />At Ealing Sir Giles got up in a rage.<Node id="228431" /> '<Node id="228433" />Why the hell can't I find out?<Node id="228463" />'
<Node id="228465" />he asked, throwing one of the Types on the table.<Node id="228514" />

<Node id="228516" />The question seemed reasonable enough.<Node id="228554" /> <Node id="228555" />For in their preliminary
investigations that afternoon both he and the Professor had found out
all they wanted.<Node id="228666" /> <Node id="228667" />Having worked out what seemed a moderately safe formula
they had experimented first on such minds as Sir Giles's housekeeper,
the Professor's old aunt, Lord Birlesmere, and others.<Node id="228847" /> <Node id="228848" />After something
of the same experiences which Lord Arglay had undergone, the results had
been satisfactory enough.<Node id="228962" /> <Node id="228963" />Sir Giles, rather to his annoyance, had been
conscious of a strongly marked, if muddled, desire that some malignant
old beast should go to China, mingled with an anxiety whether a girl
called Lizzie should be getting into trouble.<Node id="229193" /> <Node id="229194" />The process was similar in
each case.<Node id="229231" /> <Node id="229232" />There opened before the eyes of the holder of the Stone the
scene then before the eyes of the subject of the investigation, there
arose within his mind the occupation of the subject's mind, but in words
rather than in ill-defined vision.<Node id="229469" /> <Node id="229470" />The presence of the Stone in the hand
remained throughout as a kind of anchor, so that the connexion with the
actual world was never entirely lost, and could at will be wholly
re-established.<Node id="229661" />

<Node id="229663" />But when Sir Giles, rather pleased at being able apparently to get his
own back on the Chief Justice, attempted the most important experiment,
he found the result negligible.<Node id="229837" /> <Node id="229838" />He framed the formula; he called up
he consciousness of Arglay; he intensified his will.<Node id="229926" /> <Node id="229927" />There appeared
gradually before him the familiar study as seen from in front of the
fire-place; Chloe was sitting in front of him.<Node id="230057" /> <Node id="230058" />Sir Giles was aware of
thinking that Arglay had an admirable taste in women, that though of
course this girl was not really intelligent she could probably take the
Chief Justice in.<Node id="230239" /> <Node id="230240" />This consciousness went on repeating itself again and
again.<Node id="230300" /> <Node id="230301" />He tried to empty his mind, but it was no good.<Node id="230348" /> <Node id="230349" />The image of
Chloe occupied it, with a sort of detached irritation, until he recalled
himself in a fit of anger.<Node id="230461" />

<Node id="230463" />'<Node id="230464" />You try, Palliser,' he said shortly.<Node id="230500" /> '<Node id="230502" />Arglay can't be so demented on
that girl that he can think of nothing else.<Node id="230577" /> <Node id="230578" />But I'm damned if he seems
to, unless the Stone's gone wrong.<Node id="230639" />'<Node id="230640" />

<Node id="230642" />The Professor tried, with a little more success.<Node id="230690" /> '<Node id="230692" />The Chief Justice,'
he said, 'seems to be thinking of protecting God.<Node id="230761" />'<Node id="230762" />

<Node id="230764" />'<Node id="230765" />Of what?<Node id="230773" />' <Node id="230775" />Sir Giles shrieked.<Node id="230794" />

<Node id="230796" />'<Node id="230797" />That was the impression I got,' Palliser said.<Node id="230843" /> '<Node id="230845" />A strong wish to
protect and a sense that protection was valueless, and the idea--the
word God recurring.<Node id="230950" /> <Node id="230951" />All aimed at the girl.<Node id="230973" />'<Node id="230974" />

<Node id="230976" />'<Node id="230977" />I know Arglay's a legal hurdy-gurdy,' Sir Giles said, 'but even he
wouldn't play that tune.<Node id="231068" /> <Node id="231069" />But why can't I get any result?<Node id="231100" />'<Node id="231101" />

<Node id="231103" />'<Node id="231104" />You don't think,' Palliser asked rather nervously, 'that it's because
you'd already decided what he was thinking?<Node id="231217" />'<Node id="231218" />

<Node id="231220" />'<Node id="231221" />Don't be a damned fool,' said Sir Giles.<Node id="231261" /> '<Node id="231263" />I hadn't decided.<Node id="231280" /> <Node id="231281" />I know his
feeling about the girl, of course.<Node id="231326" /> <Node id="231327" />She's a presentable bitch and there's
only one thing an unmarried senility like Arglay _could_ be thinking.<Node id="231434" />
<Node id="231435" />You don't mean to tell me he's merely altruistic?<Node id="231484" /> <Node id="231485" />But he can't be
thinking of lechery the whole time.<Node id="231536" /> <Node id="231537" />He must be talking to her about
something--even God.<Node id="231589" />'<Node id="231590" />

<Node id="231592" />The Professor continued persistent.<Node id="231627" /> '<Node id="231629" />You don't think you're imposing
your view on him?<Node id="231678" />' <Node id="231680" />he said.<Node id="231688" /> '<Node id="231690" />After all, these others--your housekeeper
and the rest--we didn't know or care what they were thinking about.<Node id="231799" /> <Node id="231800" />But
Arglay and this girl--you do or you say you do.<Node id="231851" />'<Node id="231852" />

<Node id="231854" />'<Node id="231855" />Well, you don't seem to be much nearer,' Sir Giles snapped.<Node id="231914" /> '<Node id="231916" />What's
this blithering imbecility about protecting God?<Node id="231971" />'<Node id="231972" />

<Node id="231974" />'<Node id="231975" />I may not have got it quite right,' Palliser admitted.<Node id="232029" /> '<Node id="232031" />But I certainly
had the idea of protection, and of God.<Node id="232086" /> <Node id="232087" />It may have been the girl he
wanted to protect.<Node id="232134" />'<Node id="232135" />

<Node id="232137" />'<Node id="232138" />A damn good word, protection,' Tumulty sneered, and for a minute or
two seethed up and down the room.<Node id="232239" /> <Node id="232240" />Then he broke out: 'Do you mean to
tell me Arglay can read my mind and I can't read his?<Node id="232328" />'<Node id="232329" />

<Node id="232331" />'<Node id="232332" />You know best,' Palliser answered.<Node id="232366" /> '<Node id="232368" />You know how far he knew what you
were doing, and how far you know what he was.<Node id="232447" />'<Node id="232448" />

<Node id="232450" />'<Node id="232451" />He knew something about that Boy Scout of yours,' Sir Giles said, 'so
he must have _seen_ something.<Node id="232551" /> <Node id="232552" />By the way, I suppose he--what was his
filthy name?<Node id="232603" /> <Node id="232604" />Pondon?<Node id="232611" />--<Node id="232613" />is going on his merry-go-round just the same?<Node id="232658" /> <Node id="232659" />I'd
like to have a look at him.<Node id="232690" /> <Node id="232691" />I suppose we can?<Node id="232708" />'<Node id="232709" />

<Node id="232711" />'<Node id="232712" />Only take care you don't get caught up in the past too,' Palliser said.<Node id="232783" />
'<Node id="232785" />But I should think you could see him if you wanted to.<Node id="232839" /> <Node id="232840" />As I understand
it, all the past still exists and it's merely a matter of choosing your
point of view.<Node id="232942" />'<Node id="232943" />

<Node id="232945" />'<Node id="232946" />I don't see,' Sir Giles said thoughtfully, 'I really don't see how
he's ever going to get back.<Node id="233041" /> <Node id="233042" />Birlesmere's quite right--what we want
is to control the damned thing.<Node id="233112" /> <Node id="233113" />If I could do that I'd--I'd make
Arglay an infant in arms and his girl an ...<Node id="233190" /> <Node id="233191" />an embryo again.<Node id="233207" />
<Node id="233208" />Friday--Saturday--Sunday--Monday.<Node id="233241" /> <Node id="233242" />It'll very soon be four days to the
minute since your fellow willed.<Node id="233310" /> <Node id="233311" />I suppose he just goes on willing when
he reaches the top point?<Node id="233375" />'<Node id="233376" />

<Node id="233378" />'<Node id="233379" />The Stone being there too?<Node id="233405" />' <Node id="233407" />Palliser asked.<Node id="233422" />

<Node id="233424" />'<Node id="233425" />I suppose so,' Sir Giles meditatively answered.<Node id="233472" /> '<Node id="233474" />If the past is
continually scaled off the present, the Stone is scaled off too.<Node id="233553" /> <Node id="233554" />And he
goes on willing and dropping it.<Node id="233593" /> <Node id="233594" />Let's have a look at him, Palliser!<Node id="233629" />'
<Node id="233631" />Palliser hesitated a little.<Node id="233659" /> '<Node id="233661" />We want to be careful only to look,' he
said.<Node id="233706" /> '<Node id="233708" />Don't forget that half-hour.<Node id="233736" />'<Node id="233737" />

<Node id="233739" />Sir Giles looked black.<Node id="233762" /> '<Node id="233764" />I don't,' he said harshly.<Node id="233790" /> '<Node id="233792" />But we can't do
anything about that now.<Node id="233832" /> <Node id="233833" />And we only want to see the past from the
present.<Node id="233883" /> <Node id="233884" />Come along, Palliser, let's try it.<Node id="233919" /> <Node id="233920" />I desire--I will--to
see--what was his name?<Node id="233964" /> <Node id="233965" />Hezekiah?<Node id="233974" /> <Node id="233975" />O, Elijah--I will without passing into
the past to see Elijah Pondon--something like that, eh?<Node id="234069" /> <Node id="234070" />What was the
exact time--a quarter to seven, wasn't it?<Node id="234125" /> <Node id="234126" />It's almost that now.<Node id="234147" />'<Node id="234148" />

       <Node id="234157" />*       *       *       *       *<Node id="234190" />

<Node id="234192" />'<Node id="234193" />Suppose,' Lord Arglay said to Chloe, 'two persons, each holding the
Stone or its Type, wished opposite things at once, what would happen
then?<Node id="234335" />'<Node id="234336" />

<Node id="234338" />'<Node id="234339" />Nothing probably,' Chloe said.<Node id="234369" />

<Node id="234371" />'<Node id="234372" />I wonder.<Node id="234381" />' <Node id="234383" />Lord Arglay looked at the Type before them.<Node id="234426" /> '<Node id="234428" />Nothing--or
would the stronger will...<Node id="234466" />? <Node id="234468" />The point is this--you know the wretched
fellow Giles trapped?<Node id="234530" /> <Node id="234531" />Well, he willed of course; they must have
persuaded him so far.<Node id="234594" /> <Node id="234595" />But he must have willed merely in obedience, in
anxiety to please, in a kind of good-feeling--you see----?<Node id="234701" /> <Node id="234702" />And at the
moment he held a Type.<Node id="234735" />' <Node id="234737" />He paused.<Node id="234747" />

<Node id="234749" />'<Node id="234750" />Yes?<Node id="234754" />' <Node id="234756" />Chloe asked.<Node id="234768" />

<Node id="234770" />'<Node id="234771" />It's all very difficult,' Lord Arglay sighed.<Node id="234816" /> '<Node id="234818" />But if the Stone
is--what the Hajji says--indivisible and that sort of thing, mustn't all
the Types be, so to speak, _one_?<Node id="234941" /> <Node id="234942" />It sounds raving lunacy--but otherwise
I don't see ...<Node id="234996" /> <Node id="234997" />And if they are, and if a fellow had one of the Types
for a moment, could we enlarge that moment by some other Type so that he
saw--and did or didn't do what he did before?<Node id="235169" /> <Node id="235170" />Do you see?<Node id="235181" />'<Node id="235182" />

<Node id="235184" />'<Node id="235185" />Not very well,' Chloe said frankly.<Node id="235220" /> '<Node id="235222" />Wouldn't you be altering the
past?<Node id="235256" />'<Node id="235257" />

<Node id="235259" />'<Node id="235260" />Not really,' Lord Arglay went on arguing.<Node id="235301" /> '<Node id="235303" />If the Types are one then
at his moment of holding _his_ this fellow in Birmingham held this one,
and there his present touches our present.<Node id="235443" />'<Node id="235444" />

<Node id="235446" />'<Node id="235447" />But then--you mean that Time is in the Stone, not the Stone in Time?<Node id="235515" />'
<Node id="235517" />Chloe asked.<Node id="235529" />

<Node id="235531" />'<Node id="235532" />Eh?<Node id="235535" />' <Node id="235537" />said Lord Arglay, 'do I?<Node id="235561" /> <Node id="235562" />I believe I do.<Node id="235577" /> <Node id="235578" />Lucid mind!<Node id="235589" /> <Node id="235590" />But keep your
lucidity on the practical aspect.<Node id="235637" /> <Node id="235638" />Eschew the higher metaphysics for a
moment, and tell me--don't you think we might offer him other ways _at_
that moment?<Node id="235758" />'<Node id="235759" />

<Node id="235761" />'<Node id="235762" />Why are we to be so anxious to help this poor man?<Node id="235812" />' <Node id="235814" />Chloe asked.<Node id="235826" /> '<Node id="235828" />You
do dislike Sir Giles almost as much as I do, don't you, Lord Arglay?<Node id="235900" />'<Node id="235901" />

<Node id="235903" />'<Node id="235904" />I dislike tyranny, treachery, and cruelty,' the Chief Justice said.<Node id="235971" />
'<Node id="235973" />And I think that this fellow has been betrayed and tyrannized over.<Node id="236040" />
<Node id="236041" />Whether it's cruelty depends on what his past was like.<Node id="236096" /> <Node id="236097" />Besides, it's
got to be a kind of symbol for me--an omen.<Node id="236154" /> <Node id="236155" />I can't believe the Stone
likes it.<Node id="236190" />'<Node id="236191" />

<Node id="236193" />'<Node id="236194" />I don't suppose it does,' Chloe said seriously.<Node id="236241" />

<Node id="236243" />A little startled, Lord Arglay looked at her.<Node id="236288" /> '<Node id="236290" />My dear child,' he said,
'do you really think----?<Node id="236340" />' <Node id="236342" />But as she looked up at him it was so clear
that she did think exactly that, and that it seemed quite natural to
her, that he abandoned his protest.<Node id="236490" /> '<Node id="236492" />We are,' he thought to himself,
'becoming anthropomorphic a little rapidly.<Node id="236567" /> <Node id="236568" />We shall be asking the Stone
what it would like for breakfast next.<Node id="236635" />' <Node id="236637" />He played privately with the
fancy of the Stone absorbing sausages and coffee, and then decided to
postpone any protest for the moment.<Node id="236772" /> '<Node id="236774" />After all, I don't know any more
than she does,' he meditated, 'perhaps it _would_ like sausages and
coffee.<Node id="236882" /> <Node id="236883" />Shall I end with a tribal deity?<Node id="236915" /> <Node id="236916" />Well then, God help us all,
it shall be at least _our_ deity and not Giles's and Sheldrake's and
Birlesmere's.<Node id="237026" /> <Node id="237027" />Much nicer for everyone, I should think.<Node id="237067" /> <Node id="237068" />Now that we know
we create gods, do not let us hesitate in the work.<Node id="237136" />' <Node id="237138" />He blinked inwardly
at the phrase and proceeded.<Node id="237186" /> '<Node id="237188" />But I have promised to believe in God, and
here is a temptation to infidelity already, since I know that any god in
whom I can believe will be consonant with my mind.<Node id="237354" /> <Node id="237355" />So if I believe it
must be in a god consonant with me.<Node id="237409" /> <Node id="237410" />This would seem to limit God very
considerably.<Node id="237457" />'<Node id="237458" />

<Node id="237460" />'<Node id="237461" />Do I really think what?<Node id="237484" />' <Node id="237486" />Chloe asked.<Node id="237498" />

<Node id="237500" />For a moment he did not answer.<Node id="237531" /> <Node id="237532" />He considered her as she sat before him,
leaning a little forward, gravity closed over fire, waiting for his
answer, and 'Yet it is very certain,' Lord Arglay thought, 'that things
beyond my conscious invention exist and are to be believed.<Node id="237772" /> <Node id="237773" />Also that
if I choose to attribute such an admirable creation to God I am thereby
enlarging my own ideas of him, which by themselves would never have
reached it.<Node id="237934" /> <Node id="237935" />So that in some sense I do believe outside myself.<Node id="237985" />'<Node id="237986" />

<Node id="237988" />'<Node id="237989" />Nothing, nothing,' he said to Chloe.<Node id="238025" /> '<Node id="238027" />Return we to our sheep, our ewe
lamb.<Node id="238064" /> <Node id="238065" />If his will worked merely in courtesy, might it not be swept by a
stronger will?<Node id="238145" />' <Node id="238147" />He began to walk up and down the room.<Node id="238185" /> '<Node id="238187" />You know, Chloe,
I've a good mind to try it.<Node id="238231" />'<Node id="238232" />

<Node id="238234" />'<Node id="238235" />Do be careful,' Chloe said, with considerable restraint.<Node id="238291" />

<Node id="238293" />'<Node id="238294" />I shall be extremely careful,' Lord Arglay told her.<Node id="238346" /> '<Node id="238348" />But don't forget
we are rather relying on the Stone to assist us.<Node id="238413" /> <Node id="238414" />I admit that it's
purely logical and won't go against our wills, but perhaps it might even
elucidate the will.<Node id="238524" /> <Node id="238525" />Anyhow,' he added suddenly, 'I'm going to try.<Node id="238571" /> <Node id="238572" />But
what the devil do I say to it?<Node id="238606" />'<Node id="238607" />

<Node id="238609" />He took up a pencil and a sheet of paper and sat down, remaining for
some minutes engrossed.<Node id="238701" /> <Node id="238702" />When he had at last, in deep concentration, made
several marks on the paper he threw it to Chloe.<Node id="238799" /> '<Node id="238801" />There,' he said.<Node id="238817" />

<Node id="238819" />It looked almost like a magical diagram.<Node id="238859" /> <Node id="238860" />There was a rectangle in the
centre, with two or three small sketches within it which might have been
meant for human figures.<Node id="238986" /> <Node id="238987" />Above it was written '6.45 or thereabouts, and
next to it 'Pondon'.<Node id="239054" /> <Node id="239055" />Underneath 'I will that in the unity of the Stone I
may know that moment and show this present moment to him who is in the
past, and that I may return therefrom.<Node id="239216" />'<Node id="239217" />

<Node id="239219" />'<Node id="239220" />The last phrase,' Lord Arglay said, 'sounds singularly unlike a
courageous English gentleman.<Node id="239313" /> <Node id="239314" />But I shall do no good at all by being
stuck in last Friday.<Node id="239374" /> <Node id="239375" />Otherwise it's almost as good as the Hajji.<Node id="239418" />'<Node id="239419" />

<Node id="239421" />'<Node id="239422" />I think the Hajji would have added one thing,' Chloe answered, and
blushing a little wrote at the end 'Under the Protection'; then she said
hastily, 'What is the drawing meant to be?<Node id="239604" />'<Node id="239605" />

<Node id="239607" />'<Node id="239608" />That is the room where Giles's experiment took place,' Lord Arglay
explained.<Node id="239685" /> '<Node id="239687" />The squizzle on the right is Pondon, the Greek decoration on
the left is Palliser, and the thousand-legged Hindu god underneath is
Giles himself.<Node id="239832" /> <Node id="239833" />It's to help the mind.<Node id="239855" /> <Node id="239856" />With the greatest respect to the
informing spirit of the Stone I don't want to leave more to it than I
can help.<Node id="239968" />' <Node id="239970" />He looked at his watch.<Node id="239993" /> '<Node id="239995" />Six-thirty-three,' he said.<Node id="240022" /> '<Node id="240024" />Ought
one to give the Stone a little rope?<Node id="240066" />'<Node id="240067" />

<Node id="240069" />'<Node id="240070" />You think the exact time necessary?<Node id="240105" />' <Node id="240107" />Chloe asked.<Node id="240119" />

<Node id="240121" />'<Node id="240122" />Not logically, no,' Arglay said.<Node id="240154" /> '<Node id="240156" />It's merely to help my own mind
again.<Node id="240194" /> <Node id="240195" />Strictly one could reach six-forty-five on Friday from anytime
now.<Node id="240262" /> <Node id="240263" />But the nearer we are the sharper the crisis seems to me to be.<Node id="240326" />
<Node id="240327" />Silly, but true.<Node id="240343" />'<Node id="240344" />

<Node id="240346" />'<Node id="240347" />And what do I do?<Node id="240364" />' <Node id="240366" />Chloe asked.<Node id="240378" />

<Node id="240380" />Arglay looked at her a little wryly.<Node id="240416" /> '<Node id="240418" />I think you'd better just sit
still,' he said.<Node id="240464" /> '<Node id="240466" />You might pray a little if you feel sufficiently
accustomed to believing in God.<Node id="240546" />' <Node id="240548" />He picked up the Stone and settled
himself in his armchair.<Node id="240607" /> <Node id="240608" />But before he could begin to concentrate Chloe
had moved her own chair to face him, and leaning forward, laid her right
hand over his that held the Stone.<Node id="240762" /> <Node id="240763" />With her left she picked up the
diagram.<Node id="240803" />

<Node id="240805" />'<Node id="240806" />Let me try too,' she said.<Node id="240832" /> '<Node id="240834" />I'd rather not be left here alone.<Node id="240868" />'<Node id="240869" />

<Node id="240871" />'<Node id="240872" />Be warned,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="240905" /> '<Node id="240907" />You may find yourself merely taking
down the history of Organic Law.<Node id="240975" /> <Node id="240976" />Or even continually knocking Palliser's
chair away from him and getting your fingers cut infinitely often.<Node id="241082" />'<Node id="241083" />

<Node id="241085" />'<Node id="241086" />Let me try,' she urged again.<Node id="241115" /> '<Node id="241117" />Or do you think I might spoil it?<Node id="241150" />'<Node id="241151" />

<Node id="241153" />'<Node id="241154" />No,' Arglay said.<Node id="241171" /> '<Node id="241173" />I think you may save it.<Node id="241197" /> <Node id="241198" />For I am sure you are the
only one of all of us who is heartily devoted to the Stone.<Node id="241283" /> <Node id="241284" />Well, come
along then.<Node id="241306" /> <Node id="241307" />Are you comfortable?<Node id="241327" />'<Node id="241328" />

<Node id="241330" />Chloe nodded.<Node id="241343" /> '<Node id="241345" />Under the Protection,' she said softly and suddenly, and
Lord Arglay, smiling a little but not at all in scorn, gravely assented:
'Under the Protection.<Node id="241497" />' <Node id="241499" />And silence fell on the room.<Node id="241528" />

<Node id="241530" />Chloe was later on very indistinct in her own mind on what had actually
happened or seemed to happen.<Node id="241631" /> <Node id="241632" />She was even shy of explaining it to Lord
Arglay, though she did manage to give him a general idea, encouraged by
the fact that he seemed to accept it as a perfectly normal incident.<Node id="241814" /> <Node id="241815" />For
after some few minutes while she gallantly strove to keep her mind fixed
on the diagram at which she was gazing, and the unfortunate Mr. Pondon,
and Lord Arglay's almost unintelligibly fixed passion for restoring him,
and such difficult and remote things, it seemed to her as if an inner
voice very like Arglay's said firmly: 'My dear child, don't blether.<Node id="242175" />
<Node id="242176" />You know perfectly well you don't care about this at all.<Node id="242233" /> <Node id="242234" />Do let us be
accurate.<Node id="242256" /> <Node id="242257" />Now.<Node id="242261" />'<Node id="242262" />

<Node id="242264" />She made, or so she thought, a general vague protest that she was
anxious to do what he wanted, but Arglay, or the Stone, or whatever it
was that was dominating her, swept this aside; she forgot it in the
sudden rush of her consciousness to its next point of rest.<Node id="242528" /> <Node id="242529" />And this
point seemed to be the memory of Mr. Frank Lindsay.<Node id="242589" /> <Node id="242590" />She found herself
remembering with a double poignancy at once how satisfactory and how
unsatisfactory he was.<Node id="242699" /> <Node id="242700" />The poor dear did and was everything he could be;
he held her hand pleasantly, he kissed well, he displayed becoming zeal,
and if his talk was a little dull ...<Node id="242860" /> <Node id="242861" />yes, but his talk was not dull but
alien.<Node id="242902" /> <Node id="242903" />Talk, they all--and two or three other young men arose in Chloe's
mind--they all failed to be memorable in talk.<Node id="243015" /> <Node id="243016" />There came to her almost
a cloud of phrases and sentences in different voices--preceding,
accompanying, following, incidents that had certainly not been talk.<Node id="243174" />
<Node id="243175" />They had been extremely delightful--incidents and companions alike--she
was an ungrateful creature.<Node id="243274" /> <Node id="243275" />But her palm rested on something that was
warmer and closer and steadier than any kiss on that palm had been, and
the ends of her fingers touched a hand that was warm and intimate and
serene.<Node id="243466" /> <Node id="243467" />And again the voice that was Arglay's or the Stone's said within
her: 'Go on, child.<Node id="243551" />' <Node id="243553" />In a sudden reaction it seemed to her that she
hated that intimate but austere government.<Node id="243643" /> <Node id="243644" />She hung suspended between
it and Frank Lindsay.<Node id="243692" /> <Node id="243693" />Times upon times seemed to pass as she waited,
without the power of choice between this and that, hating to lose and
fearing to gain either because of the loss of the other that such gain
must bring.<Node id="243892" /> <Node id="243893" />She must, she thought vaguely, be getting very old, too old
to be loved or desired, too old to desire.<Node id="243995" /> <Node id="243996" />Her memories were spectral
now; her companions and peers very faint and circling round her in an
unnoticing procession.<Node id="244115" /> <Node id="244116" />And besides them what else had there been in her
life?<Node id="244170" /> <Node id="244171" />There came to her a phrase--the _Survey of Organic Law_.<Node id="244227" />--_<Node id="244230" />Organic
Law_ had never meant very much to her, and this increasing loneliness
and age was law, organic law.<Node id="244337" /> <Node id="244338" />But again there pierced through that
loneliness the double strength upon which her hand rested.<Node id="244433" /> <Node id="244434" />The words
grew sacramental; they had not existed by themselves but as the
communication--little enough understood--of a stored and illuminated
mind.<Node id="244582" /> <Node id="244583" />Who was it, long before, had used those words?<Node id="244629" /> <Node id="244630" />And suddenly at a
great distance she saw the figure of Lord Arglay as he stood in Sir
Giles's room holding the Stone--the Justice of England, direct in the
line of the makers and expositors of law.<Node id="244827" /> <Node id="244828" />Other names arose, Suleiman
and Charlemagne and Augustus, the Khalifs and Caesars of the world,
of a world in which a kiss was for a moment but their work for a longer
time, and though they grew old their work was final, each in its degree,
and endured.<Node id="245081" /> <Node id="245082" />Between those figures and her young lovers, now, in
her increasing age, she could not stop to choose; immediately and
infinitesimally her mind shifted and she forgot her throbbing past.<Node id="245267" /> <Node id="245268" />It
avenged itself at once; the names grew cold and the figures vague as she
dwelled in them.<Node id="245360" /> <Node id="245361" />She seemed to meet the eyes of the ghostly Arglay, and
he smiled and shook his head.<Node id="245445" /> <Node id="245446" />No longer strong but very faint the same
voice said to her: 'Go on, child.<Node id="245520" />' <Node id="245522" />But where and how was she to go?<Node id="245554" /> <Node id="245555" />A
cold darkness was about her and within her, and at the end of that
darkness the high vision of instruction and fair companionship was
fading also in the night.<Node id="245716" /> <Node id="245717" />Despairingly she called to it; despairingly
with all her soul she answered: 'I will go on, I will, but tell me how.<Node id="245832" />'
<Node id="245834" />The phantom did not linger gently to mock or comfort her; it was gone,
and around her was an absolute desolation which she supposed must be
death.<Node id="245980" /> <Node id="245981" />All the pain of heart-ache she had ever known, all negligences,
desertions, and betrayals, were gathered here, and were shutting
themselves up with her alone.<Node id="246139" /> <Node id="246140" />Beyond any memory of a hurt and lonely
youth, beyond any imagination of an unwanted and miserable age, this
pain fed on itself and abolished time.<Node id="246286" /> <Node id="246287" />She lay stupefied in anguish.<Node id="246316" />

<Node id="246318" />From somewhere a voice spoke to her, an outer voice, increasing in
clearness; she heard it through the night.<Node id="246427" /> '<Node id="246429" />Child,' Lord Arglay was
saying with a restrained anxiety, and then, still carefully, 'Chloe!<Node id="246521" />
<Node id="246522" />Chloe, child!<Node id="246535" />' <Node id="246537" />She made a small effort towards him, and suddenly the
pain passed from her and the outer world began to appear.<Node id="246648" /> <Node id="246649" />But in the
less than second in which that change took place she saw, away beyond
her, glowing between the darkness and the returning day, the mild
radiance of the Stone.<Node id="246818" /> <Node id="246819" />Away where the apparition of Lord Arglay had
seemed to be, it shone, white interspersed with gold, dilating and lucid
from within.<Node id="246949" /> <Node id="246950" />Only in the general alteration of her knowledge she was
aware of that perfection, and catching up her breath at the vision she
loosed it again in the study and found the Chief Justice watching her.<Node id="247147" />

<Node id="247149" />Lord Arglay's own experience had been much more definable.<Node id="247207" /> <Node id="247208" />He shaped
in his mind the image of the room in which he had seen the three men,
formulated as clearly as he could his desire to offer Pondon a way of
return and made an effort towards submitting the whole thing to whatever
Power reposed in the Stone.<Node id="247458" /> <Node id="247459" />He took all possible care to avoid any
desire towards an active imposition of his will, since it appeared to
him that such a desire involved not only danger to himself, but probable
failure in his attempt.<Node id="247664" /> <Node id="247665" />Less moved, in spite of his protestations, by
the mere romanticism of the thing than Chloe, unaffected by titles and
traditions and half-ceremonial fables, he yet arrived at something of
the same attitude by a process of rationalism.<Node id="247898" /> <Node id="247899" />He did not know how far
the Stone was capable of action--perhaps not at all; but until he did
know a great deal more about its potentialities than he did at the
moment, he refused to do more than make an attempt to provide Pondon
with a way of return.<Node id="248150" /> <Node id="248151" />How far, and in what manner, such a return would
present itself to the consciousness of Sir Giles's victim, he could not
tell; the endeavour was bound to be experimental only.<Node id="248326" /> <Node id="248327" />But he did not
primarily wish to move himself to the building at Birmingham; he wanted
to bring that complex of minds and place and time again into the
presence of the Stone.<Node id="248501" /> <Node id="248502" />He resolved his thoughts into lucidity and sat
waiting.<Node id="248557" />

<Node id="248559" />For what seemed a long while nothing happened.<Node id="248605" /> <Node id="248606" />Concentrated on his
thought he remained unconscious of the look of strain that gradually
occupied Chloe's face; at first he was vaguely conscious of her, then he
lost her altogether.<Node id="248788" /> <Node id="248789" />For though there was at first no change either in
his surroundings or in his thought yet change there was.<Node id="248895" /> <Node id="248896" />Something was
pressing against his eyes from within; he felt unnaturally detached,
floating, as it were, in his chair.<Node id="249014" /> <Node id="249015" />A slight nausea attacked him and
passed; his brain was swimming in a sudden faintness.<Node id="249101" /> <Node id="249102" />The room about him
was the same and yet not the same.<Node id="249155" /> <Node id="249156" />The table at his right hand seemed to
be multiplied; a number of identical tables appeared beyond it in a
long line stretching out to a vague infinity, and all around him the
furniture multiplied itself so.<Node id="249362" /> <Node id="249363" />Walls that were and yet were not
transparent sometimes obscured it and sometimes dissolved and vanished.<Node id="249467" />
<Node id="249468" />He saw himself in different positions, now here, now there, and seemed
to recognize them.<Node id="249557" /> <Node id="249558" />Whenever his mind paused on any one of these eidola
of himself it seemed to be fixed, and all the rest to fade, and then his
mind would relax and again the phantasmagoria would close in, shifting,
vanishing, reappearing.<Node id="249778" /> <Node id="249779" />He became astonishingly aware of himself sitting
there, much more acutely so than in any normal action; a hand was still
on his, but it was not Chloe's or was it Chloe's?<Node id="249949" /> <Node id="249950" />No, it was another
hand, masculine, more aged; it was ...<Node id="250007" /> <Node id="250008" />it was the Hajji's.<Node id="250027" /> <Node id="250028" />Lord Arglay
began to think: 'But this is Friday then,'--with an effort abolished
the thought, and went on keeping the problem in his mind clear.<Node id="250172" />
<Node id="250173" />The myriad images of himself that vacillated about him were vastly
disconcerting--and there were other people too, his servant, the Hajji,
Chloe.<Node id="250318" /> <Node id="250319" />He was doing or saying something with each of them.<Node id="250370" /> <Node id="250371" />It was like
a dream, yet it was not like a dream for distinct memory hovered round
him, and he found that only by a strong inhibition could he prevent
himself submitting to it and being conscious only of some precise
moment.<Node id="250595" /> <Node id="250596" />The apprehensions began to deepen downwards and outwards but not
by the mere inclusion of neighbouring space.<Node id="250705" /> <Node id="250706" />An entirely new plane of
things thrust itself in and across various of the appearances; in an
acute angle almost like a wedge a different room thrust itself down over
a picture of himself talking to the Hajji, but within this wedge itself
were infinite appearances, swelling like a huge balloon with a painted
cover and loosing fresh balloons and new thrusting wedges in all
directions.<Node id="251092" /> <Node id="251093" />In one group of superimposed layers he was aware of Giles
doing a thousand things, and then suddenly, as if in a streak of white
light driving right across the whole mirage he was aware of Giles
watching.<Node id="251297" /> <Node id="251298" />In a new resolution he turned from Giles to Pondon, but he
couldn't see Pondon, or not at all clearly; it seemed to him certainly
that Pondon now and again was walking about, was walking towards him,
down a floor that ran level with his eyes, straight towards the bridge
of his nose.<Node id="251581" /> <Node id="251582" />The physical discomfort of the sensation was almost
unbearable, but Lord Arglay held on.<Node id="251670" /> <Node id="251671" />Pondon now like a tiny speck was
right up against him, and then the discomfort vanished.<Node id="251759" /> <Node id="251760" />A hand--not
Chloe's, not the Hajji's, was closing round the Stone in his own hand.<Node id="251842" />
<Node id="251843" />Lord Arglay made another act of submission to the Stone; all times were
here and equal--if the captive of the past could understand.<Node id="251975" /> <Node id="251976" />The Stone
seemed to melt, and almost before he had realized it to reharden; the
intruding hand was gone.<Node id="252080" /> <Node id="252081" />There was a faint crash somewhere, a sensation
of rushing violence.<Node id="252148" /> <Node id="252149" />Lord Arglay found himself on his feet and gasping
for breath while before him Chloe lay pallid and silent and with shut
eyes in her chair.<Node id="252287" />

<Node id="252289" />He stood still for a few seconds till he was breathing more normally and
had become more conscious of his surroundings; then, feeling slightly
uncertain of his balance, he sat down again.<Node id="252476" /> <Node id="252477" />He became aware that his
hand and Chloe's were now closely interlocked; in the hollow between the
two he felt the Stone.<Node id="252597" /> <Node id="252598" />He looked more carefully at his secretary; he put
out his other hand and felt the table near him; then he sighed a little.<Node id="252720" />
'<Node id="252722" />And I wonder,' he said to himself, 'if anything has happened.<Node id="252783" /> <Node id="252784" />Heavens,
how tired I am!<Node id="252808" /> <Node id="252809" />And what on earth is happening to this child?<Node id="252854" /> <Node id="252855" />She looks
as if she were going through it too.<Node id="252901" /> <Node id="252902" />Dare one do anything?<Node id="252923" />... <Node id="252927" />I wonder
why Giles shot across like that.<Node id="252968" /> _<Node id="252970" />He_ didn't seem to do anything.<Node id="253001" /> <Node id="253002" />I
wonder--I wonder about it all.<Node id="253034" /> <Node id="253035" />Where is Pondon?<Node id="253051" /> <Node id="253052" />Where is Giles?<Node id="253067" /> <Node id="253068" />Where am
I?<Node id="253079" /> <Node id="253080" />And above all where is my admirable secretary?<Node id="253126" />'<Node id="253127" />

<Node id="253129" />Very gently he disengaged their hands, but not entirely, restoring them
to the position they were in at the beginning of the experiment.<Node id="253265" /> <Node id="253266" />He
looked at his watch; it marked six forty-seven.<Node id="253316" /> '<Node id="253318" />I wonder,' Lord Arglay
said, still staring at it, 'if Pondon caught the connexion.<Node id="253400" /> <Node id="253401" />It's all
very difficult....<Node id="253428" /> <Node id="253429" />I seem,' he added, 'to remember saying that before.<Node id="253480" />
<Node id="253481" />Well ...<Node id="253489" />' <Node id="253491" />He leant forward a little and said, softly, but clearly,
'Chloe ...<Node id="253558" /> <Node id="253559" />Chloe ...<Node id="253568" /> <Node id="253569" />Chloe, child!<Node id="253582" />'<Node id="253583" />




<Node id="253588" />CHAPTER X<Node id="253597" />

<Node id="253599" />THE APPEAL OF THE MAYOR OF RICH<Node id="253630" />


<Node id="253633" />Oliver Doncaster, having been suddenly thrown over both by Mr.
Sheldrake and Lord Birlesmere, and finding himself in London with nobody
wanting him, determined to return to his holiday village.<Node id="253826" /> <Node id="253827" />As he walked
to the station he found himself considerably irritated by the treatment
he had received.<Node id="253928" /> <Node id="253929" />He had been asked by the police to be good enough to
attend this conference, and now he was flung into the street with the
other less important people.<Node id="254080" /> <Node id="254081" />No one had explained anything to him.<Node id="254118" /> <Node id="254119" />He
didn't even know who half the people he had seen were.<Node id="254176" /> <Node id="254177" />He had heard Lord
Arglay's name and recognized it; he had a vague recollection of having
once read an extremely outspoken book by Sir Giles on the religious
aspect of the marriage customs of a tribe of cannibals in Polynesia.<Node id="254402" /> <Node id="254403" />But
who Palliser was or the girl who had landed Palliser on the floor he had
no idea, nor why she had done it.<Node id="254513" /> <Node id="254514" />Why had she rushed round and flown at
Sir Giles's throat?<Node id="254571" /> '<Node id="254573" />I almost wish,' he thought, 'she'd flown at mine.<Node id="254622" />
<Node id="254623" />Or Sheldrake's.<Node id="254638" /> <Node id="254639" />I should have liked to help her wring Sheldrake's neck.<Node id="254694" />
<Node id="254695" />I wonder if she hurt herself much.<Node id="254729" /> <Node id="254730" />Anyhow it won't matter if she's got
one of the Stones.<Node id="254784" /> <Node id="254785" />Why the devil didn't I take one?<Node id="254817" /> <Node id="254818" />Why does no one tell
me what it's all about?<Node id="254862" /> <Node id="254863" />Why did Sir Giles cut the Stone to bits?<Node id="254903" /> <Node id="254904" />And why
did that girl want to stop him?<Node id="254943" />' <Node id="254945" />As far as Rich he entertained himself
with such questions.<Node id="255003" />

<Node id="255005" />Rich itself, when he arrived there, seemed to be similarly, but rather
more angrily, engaged.<Node id="255098" /> <Node id="255099" />There were groups in the streets and at the
doors; there were dialogues and conversations proceeding everywhere.<Node id="255211" />
<Node id="255212" />There were policemen--a number of policemen--moving as unnoticeably
as possible through the slightly uncivil population.<Node id="255332" /> <Node id="255333" />In fact it was,
Doncaster thought, as much like the morning after the night before on a
generous scale as need be.<Node id="255447" /> <Node id="255448" />It occurred to him that he would go round and
see Mrs. Ferguson's sister on his way; it would be interesting to know
whether she remained in her recovered health--if he could reach her, of
course, because as he wandered towards her street the groups seemed, in
spite of the continually pacing police, to be larger and more numerous.<Node id="255780" />
<Node id="255781" />The street itself however was passable, though not much more, and he had
just turned into it, when he was startled into a pause by a high shrill
voice some distance off which called over the street, 'Where's the
Stone?<Node id="255999" /> <Node id="256000" />Take me to the Stone.<Node id="256021" />'<Node id="256022" />

<Node id="256024" />Oliver looked at the people near him.<Node id="256061" /> <Node id="256062" />One man shook his head placidly
and said, 'Ah there he is again.<Node id="256126" />' <Node id="256128" />But the rest were listening, he
thought, almost sullenly, and one or two muttered something, and another
gave a short laugh.<Node id="256252" /> <Node id="256253" />Conversations ceased; a policeman, wandering by,
caught Oliver's eye, and seemed to meet it dubiously as if he were not
quite certain what to do.<Node id="256398" />

<Node id="256400" />'<Node id="256401" />Where's the Stone?<Node id="256419" />' <Node id="256421" />the voice shrilled again.<Node id="256446" /> '<Node id="256448" />I want to see.<Node id="256462" /> <Node id="256463" />Won't
some kind friend take a poor old blind man to the Stone?<Node id="256525" />'<Node id="256526" />

<Node id="256528" />'<Node id="256529" />What is it?<Node id="256540" />' <Node id="256542" />Oliver said to his nearest neighbour, the man who had
laughed.<Node id="256604" />

<Node id="256606" />'<Node id="256607" />That's old Sam Mutton,' the man said in a surly scorn.<Node id="256661" /> '<Node id="256663" />Stone-blind and
half-dotty.<Node id="256690" /> <Node id="256691" />He's heard of this Stone and he's made his grand-daughter
take him about the town all day to look for it.<Node id="256796" />' <Node id="256798" />He lifted his own voice
suddenly and called back, 'No use, Sam, the police have got it.<Node id="256885" /> <Node id="256886" />It's not
for you and me to get well with it.<Node id="256930" />'<Node id="256931" />

<Node id="256933" />The cry went over the silent street like a threat.<Node id="256983" /> <Node id="256984" />But in answer the
old man's voice came back, 'I can't see.<Node id="257042" /> <Node id="257043" />I want to see.<Node id="257057" /> <Node id="257058" />Take me to the
Stone.<Node id="257079" />' <Node id="257081" />Each sentence ended in what was nearly a prolonged shriek, and
as Oliver took a pace or two forward he saw the speaker in front of him.<Node id="257216" />
<Node id="257217" />It was a very old man, bald and wizened, approaching slowly, leaning on
the one side on a stick, on the other on the arm of a girl of about
twenty, who, as they moved, seemed to be trying to persuade him to
return.<Node id="257431" /> <Node id="257432" />She was whispering hurriedly to him; her other hand lay on his
arm.<Node id="257499" /> <Node id="257500" />Even at a little distance Oliver noticed how pale she was and how
the hand trembled.<Node id="257584" /> <Node id="257585" />But the old man shook it off and began again calling
out in that dreadful agonized voice, 'I want to se-ee; take me to the
Sto-one.<Node id="257716" />'<Node id="257717" />

<Node id="257719" />On the moment the girl gave way.<Node id="257751" /> <Node id="257752" />She collapsed on the ground, her arm
slipping from the old man's grasp so that he nearly fell, and broke into
a violent fit of hysterics.<Node id="257889" /> <Node id="257890" />Two or three women ran to her, but above her
rending sobs and laughter her grandfather's voice went up in a more
intense refrain.<Node id="258019" /> '<Node id="258021" />Where's the Stone?<Node id="258039" /> <Node id="258040" />I can't see.<Node id="258052" /> <Node id="258053" />Nancy, I can't see,
take me to the Stone.<Node id="258094" />' <Node id="258096" />The policeman had come back and was saying
something to Oliver's neighbour who listened sullenly.<Node id="258193" /> '--<Node id="258197" />get him home,'
Oliver heard, and heard the answer, 'You get him home--if you can.<Node id="258278" />' <Node id="258280" />The
policeman--he looked young and unhappy enough--went up to the old man,
saying something in a voice that tried to be comfortable and cheering.<Node id="258425" />
<Node id="258426" />But old Sam, if that were his name, turned and clutched at him, and
broke out in a shrill senile wail of passion that appalled Oliver, 'I'm
dying, I'm dying.<Node id="258583" /> <Node id="258584" />I want to see before I die.<Node id="258611" /> <Node id="258612" />I'm dying.<Node id="258622" /> <Node id="258623" />I want to see.<Node id="258637" />
<Node id="258638" />O kind, kind friends, will no one bring me to the Stone?<Node id="258694" />'<Node id="258695" />

<Node id="258697" />'<Node id="258698" />The police have got the Stone,' Oliver's neighbour called.<Node id="258756" /> '<Node id="258758" />Who cares
if you want to see?<Node id="258787" /> <Node id="258788" />The police have got the Stone.<Node id="258818" />'<Node id="258819" />

<Node id="258821" />'<Node id="258822" />God blast the police,' said someone the other side of Oliver, and a
young working man, of about his own age, thrust himself violently
forward opposite the constable.<Node id="258987" /> '<Node id="258989" />You, damn you, you've killed my wife.<Node id="259026" />
<Node id="259027" />My wife's dead, she died this morning, and the baby's dead--and they'd
have lived if I'd got the Stone.<Node id="259130" />' <Node id="259132" />He made sudden gestures and the
policeman, letting go of the old man, stepped back.<Node id="259215" /> <Node id="259216" />Oliver saw two or
three more helmets moving forward in support, and a voice behind him
said sharply, 'Now then, now then, what's all this?<Node id="259354" />'<Node id="259355" />

<Node id="259357" />He looked round.<Node id="259373" /> <Node id="259374" />A group of men were pushing past him.<Node id="259411" /> <Node id="259412" />One was a short
fierce-looking man, with an aggressive moustache; beside him was an
older and larger man, with a grave set face.<Node id="259540" /> <Node id="259541" />Behind these two were a
police-inspector and two or three constables.<Node id="259610" />

<Node id="259612" />'<Node id="259613" />What's all this?<Node id="259629" />' <Node id="259631" />said the little man angrily.<Node id="259659" /> '<Node id="259661" />Constable, why aren't
you keeping the street clear?<Node id="259712" /> <Node id="259713" />Don't you know your orders?<Node id="259740" /> <Node id="259741" />Who's this
man?<Node id="259756" /> <Node id="259757" />Why are you letting him make all this noise?<Node id="259801" /> <Node id="259802" />What's he got to do
with it?<Node id="259830" /> <Node id="259831" />Don't you know we can hear him all over the town?<Node id="259880" /> <Node id="259881" />Gross
incapacity.<Node id="259898" /> <Node id="259899" />You'll hear more of this.<Node id="259924" />'<Node id="259925" />

<Node id="259927" />The young constable opened his mouth to speak and shut it again.<Node id="259991" /> <Node id="259992" />The
tall man laid his hand on his companion's arm.<Node id="260042" /> '<Node id="260044" />One man can't do
everything, Chief Constable,' he said in a low voice.<Node id="260114" /> '<Node id="260116" />And Sam's a
difficult person to deal with.<Node id="260158" /> <Node id="260159" />I think we'd better leave it to the
inspector here to deal with things quietly.<Node id="260238" />'<Node id="260239" />

<Node id="260241" />'<Node id="260242" />Quietly?<Node id="260250" />' <Node id="260252" />the Chief Constable snapped.<Node id="260280" /> '<Node id="260282" />Quietly!<Node id="260290" /> <Node id="260291" />Look here, Mr. Mayor,
you've been at me all day to do things quietly, and I've given in here
and given in there, and this is the end of it.<Node id="260430" />' <Node id="260432" />He looked over his
shoulder, 'Clear the street at once, inspector,' he said.<Node id="260508" /> '<Node id="260510" />And tell that
old dodderer that if he makes another sound I'll have him in prison for
brawling.<Node id="260605" />'<Node id="260606" />

<Node id="260608" />The Mayor said firmly, 'You can't arrest him; he's a well-known
character here, and everyone's sorry for him and his grand-daughter.<Node id="260740" />
<Node id="260741" />Besides, it's natural enough that he should be crying out like this.<Node id="260809" />'<Node id="260810" />

<Node id="260812" />'<Node id="260813" />I don't care whether it's natural or not,' the Chief Constable
answered.<Node id="260885" /> '<Node id="260887" />He's not going to do it here.<Node id="260916" /> <Node id="260917" />Now, inspector, I'm waiting.<Node id="260945" />'<Node id="260946" />

<Node id="260948" />The inspector signed to his men, who began to make separate and gentle
movements forward.<Node id="261037" /> <Node id="261038" />But after a step or two the advance flickered and
ceased.<Node id="261095" /> <Node id="261096" />The general murmur, 'Now then, now then, you can't hang about
here,' died in and into the silence with which it was received.<Node id="261221" /> <Node id="261222" />The
crowd remained sullenly fixed.<Node id="261256" />

<Node id="261258" />'<Node id="261259" />Inspector!<Node id="261269" />' <Node id="261271" />the Chief Constable said impatiently.<Node id="261308" />

<Node id="261310" />The inspector looked at Oliver who was close to him, recognized his
kind, and said in a low almost plaintive voice.<Node id="261425" /> '<Node id="261427" />Now, sir, if you'd
start some of them would get away.<Node id="261480" />'<Node id="261481" />

<Node id="261483" />'<Node id="261484" />And why the devil,' Oliver asked very loudly, 'should we get away?<Node id="261550" />'<Node id="261551" />

<Node id="261553" />There was a stiffening in the crowd near him, a quick murmur, almost the
beginning of a cheer.<Node id="261647" /> <Node id="261648" />The Mayor and the Chief Constable both looked at
Oliver.<Node id="261704" />

<Node id="261706" />'<Node id="261707" />Say that again, my man,' the latter said, 'and I'll have you in prison
for resisting the police.<Node id="261803" />'<Node id="261804" />

<Node id="261806" />'<Node id="261807" />The Lord Chief Justice,' Oliver said, more loudly still, 'is entirely
opposed to the action of the Government.<Node id="261917" />' <Node id="261919" />He had hardly meant to say
that, but as soon as it was said he thought hastily that in the
morning's conference the Chief Justice _hadn't_ seemed to be exactly one
with the Government.<Node id="262103" /> <Node id="262104" />But he realized in a minute that his sentence,
meaning one thing, had meant to his hearers quite another.<Node id="262209" /> <Node id="262210" />A more
definite noise broke out around him.<Node id="262253" /> '<Node id="262255" />This,' he thought, 'is almost a
roar.<Node id="262292" />'<Node id="262293" />

<Node id="262295" />The Chief Constable began to say something, but the Mayor checked him
with a lifted hand.<Node id="262384" /> '<Node id="262386" />Do I understand you, sir,' he asked, 'to say that
the Chief Justice considers the action of the Government illegal?<Node id="262501" /> <Node id="262502" />Do you
speak from your own certain knowledge?<Node id="262547" />'<Node id="262548" />

<Node id="262550" />Oliver thought of saying, 'Well, I don't know about _illegal_,' but the
phrase was so deplorably weak that he abandoned it.<Node id="262673" /> <Node id="262674" />Besides, in that
large room at the Foreign Office--Lord Birlesmere, Sir Giles, Chloe's
bleeding fingers--'The Chief Justice's secretary,' he said clearly,
'was seriously injured this morning in--protesting against--the action
of--certain associates of the Government, and the Chief Justice takes
the most serious view of the situation.<Node id="263009" />'<Node id="263010" />

<Node id="263012" />This might be a little compressed, he felt; Lord Arglay's actual words
had seemed a trifle less official.<Node id="263117" /> <Node id="263118" />And seriously injured?<Node id="263140" /> <Node id="263141" />Still...<Node id="263149" />

<Node id="263151" />The inspector stood still, looking worried, and glanced gloomily at
the Chief Constable, who was making half-audible noises.<Node id="263275" /> <Node id="263276" />The Mayor
considered Doncaster evenly.<Node id="263314" /> <Node id="263315" />Somebody behind shouted, 'The Government's
broken the law,' and Oliver felt a little cold as he heard this final
reduction of his own sentences to a supposed fact.<Node id="263478" /> <Node id="263479" />In the following
silence, 'I want the Stone' the old man wailed again.<Node id="263549" />

<Node id="263551" />'<Node id="263552" />We all want the Stone,' another voice called, and another, 'Who cares
what they say?<Node id="263636" /> <Node id="263637" />We want the Stone.<Node id="263655" />' <Node id="263657" />Cheers and shouts answered.<Node id="263684" /> <Node id="263685" />A man
stumbled heavily against the inspector, who was thrown back upon the
Chief Constable.<Node id="263776" />

<Node id="263778" />The incident might have become a m�l�e if the Mayor had not intervened.<Node id="263849" />
<Node id="263850" />He held up both arms, crying in a great voice, 'Silence, silence!<Node id="263915" />
<Node id="263916" />Silence for the Mayor,' and went to a horse-trough near by motioning to
Oliver to follow him; by whose assistance he mounted on the edge of the
trough.<Node id="264067" /> <Node id="264068" />Holding to an electric light standard he began to address the
crowd.<Node id="264136" />

<Node id="264138" />'<Node id="264139" />Good people,' he said in a stentorian voice, 'you all know me.<Node id="264201" /> <Node id="264202" />I will
ask you to return to your homes and leave me to discover the truth about
this matter.<Node id="264294" /> <Node id="264295" />I am the Mayor of Rich, and if the people of Rich have been
injured it is my business to remedy it and help them.<Node id="264408" /> <Node id="264409" />If, as appears,
the Stone of which we have heard is able to heal illness, and if the
Government are using it, as swiftly as may be, for that purpose, it is
the duty of all good citizens to accept what delay the common good of
all demands.<Node id="264647" /> <Node id="264648" />But it is equally their right to be assured that the
Government is doing its utmost in the matter, day and night, so that not
a single moment may be lost in freeing as many as may be from pain and
suffering.<Node id="264855" /> <Node id="264856" />I shall make it my concern to discover this at once.<Node id="264908" /> <Node id="264909" />I know
the hindrances which must, and I fear those which may, follow on what
has happened.<Node id="264999" /> <Node id="265000" />I will myself go to London.<Node id="265027" />' <Node id="265029" />He paused a moment, then he
went on.<Node id="265065" /> '<Node id="265067" />Some of you may know that my son is dying of cancer.<Node id="265119" /> <Node id="265120" />If it is
a matter of ensuring swiftness and order he and I will be the last in
all the country to claim assistance.<Node id="265235" /> <Node id="265236" />But I tell you this that you may be
very sure that he shall not suffer an hour longer than need be because
of the doubts or fears or stupidities of the servants of the people.<Node id="265411" />
<Node id="265412" />Return to your homes and to-morrow at this time you shall know all that
I know.<Node id="265491" />' <Node id="265493" />He paused again and ended with a loud cry, 'God save the King.<Node id="265555" />'<Node id="265556" />

<Node id="265558" />'<Node id="265559" />God save the King!<Node id="265577" />' <Node id="265579" />yelled Oliver in a thrill of delight, and assisted
the Mayor to descend.<Node id="265651" /> <Node id="265652" />Who turned on him at once and went on talking
before the Chief Constable could interrupt.<Node id="265741" /> '<Node id="265743" />I shall want you,' he
said.<Node id="265770" /> '<Node id="265772" />I want all the information you can give me, and I may need your
personal help.<Node id="265850" /> <Node id="265851" />Are you free?<Node id="265864" /> <Node id="265865" />But it doesn't matter whether you are or
not.<Node id="265910" /> <Node id="265911" />I demand your presence in the name of the King and by the authority
of my office.<Node id="265992" /> <Node id="265993" />We will go to the Town Hall first.<Node id="266027" /> <Node id="266028" />Barker,' he went on, to
a man behind him, 'see that the car is kept all ready in front of the
Town Hall.<Node id="266132" /> <Node id="266133" />Inspector, I rely on you to see that the promise I have made
is published everywhere, and I warn you that the bench will examine very
carefully any case of reported brawling brought before them in this
connexion.<Node id="266345" /> <Node id="266346" />Chief Constable, I am obliged for your assistance, but I
think the situation is well in hand, and the chief magistrate can
dispense with any outside help.<Node id="266500" /> <Node id="266501" />Come along, young man--what is your
name?<Node id="266542" />'<Node id="266543" />

<Node id="266545" />What account exactly Oliver gave the Mayor he was never very clear.<Node id="266612" />
<Node id="266613" />But, whatever it was, it was bound to confirm in the other's mind the
importance of the Stone and the need for urging immediate action on
the Government.<Node id="266766" /> <Node id="266767" />Once in the Town Hall, Oliver found himself in a maze
of action.<Node id="266831" /> <Node id="266832" />There was a small, stout, and facetious alderman who was
apparently being left in charge as deputy mayor; there was an auburn and
agitated Town Clerk; there were the girl typists who are spread all over
England; there were commissionaires and chauffeurs and telephones and
councillors and a male clerk--Oliver had had no idea so many people
could accumulate in the seat of authority of a small country town.<Node id="267239" /> <Node id="267240" />He
was rather curious to learn what the Mayor's own name was, and at last
by dint of studying the notices on the wall discovered that it was
Clerishaw--Eustace Clerishaw.<Node id="267410" /> <Node id="267411" />He had hardly fixed on this when its owner
was on him again.<Node id="267471" />

<Node id="267473" />'<Node id="267474" />I shall want you to come with me,' the Mayor said.<Node id="267524" /> '<Node id="267526" />I am going to
London at once.<Node id="267555" />'<Node id="267556" />

<Node id="267558" />'<Node id="267559" />But what good shall I be?<Node id="267584" />' <Node id="267586" />Oliver asked, as he was hurried to the door,
but without any real regret at finding himself thus caught up again in
the operations of the Stone.<Node id="267730" />

<Node id="267732" />'<Node id="267733" />I may,' the Mayor went on, 'want to see Lord Arglay, but I shall go to
the Home Office first.<Node id="267826" />'<Node id="267827" />

<Node id="267829" />'<Node id="267830" />If you get as much satisfaction as we did at the Foreign Office,'
Oliver answered, 'you'll be there for months.<Node id="267941" /> <Node id="267942" />What do you think they'll
do?<Node id="267971" />'<Node id="267972" />

<Node id="267974" />The Mayor, taking no notice, pushed him out of the Town Hall and
followed him.<Node id="268052" /> <Node id="268053" />There was a large crowd at the entrance, and a cheer went
up when they appeared.<Node id="268133" /> <Node id="268134" />As they hurried down to the car which stood in
readiness a policeman sprang to open it and Oliver recognized the young
constable he had seen before.<Node id="268282" /> <Node id="268283" />They scrambled in; the policeman banged
the door, and put his head in.<Node id="268353" />

<Node id="268355" />'<Node id="268356" />Good luck, sir,' he said.<Node id="268381" /> '<Node id="268383" />Good luck and give them hell.<Node id="268412" />'<Node id="268413" />

<Node id="268415" />'<Node id="268416" />Heavens above,' thought Oliver as he sat down, 'the Pretorian Guard's
beginning to mutiny.<Node id="268506" />'<Node id="268507" />

<Node id="268509" />For the rest of the journey he was undergoing a close interrogation, and
by the time they reached London the Mayor seemed more or less satisfied.<Node id="268654" />
<Node id="268655" />He sat back and stretched his legs.<Node id="268690" />

<Node id="268692" />'<Node id="268693" />The Deputy Mayor, with the help of my clerk and so on,' he said, 'is
getting into touch with all the Mayors in the affected district.<Node id="268826" /> <Node id="268827" />During
Sunday crowds from at least five other centres came out to Rich, and
returned, I fear, with very little satisfaction.<Node id="268951" /> <Node id="268952" />I have been asked
questions by all the Mayors, but until I found you I had very little
information to go on.<Node id="269060" />'<Node id="269061" />

<Node id="269063" />'<Node id="269064" />I shouldn't think you'd got much now,' Oliver said.<Node id="269115" />

<Node id="269117" />The Mayor looked at his notes.<Node id="269147" /> '<Node id="269149" />As I understand,' he went on, slowly,
'the matter is at present in the hands of the Foreign Office, and some
kind of strain exists between that Department and the Lord Chief
Justice.<Node id="269331" /> <Node id="269332" />I heard from Mr. Sheldrake--whom I saw for a few minutes
yesterday--that Lord Arglay was in some way connected with the whole
thing--indeed, Mrs. Sheldrake seemed to think he was responsible for
the trouble.<Node id="269539" /> <Node id="269540" />But I have always been very much impressed by such of
Lord Arglay's judgements as I have been able to read and follow, and
I was greatly struck by an article of his I once read on the Nature
of Law.<Node id="269738" /> <Node id="269739" />A little abstract, perhaps, but very interesting; he defined
law provisionally as "the formal expression of increasing communal
self-knowledge" and had an excursus comparing the variations in law
with the variations in poetic diction from age to age, the aim being
to discover the best plastic medium for expression in action.<Node id="270065" /> <Node id="270066" />Very
interesting.<Node id="270083" />'<Node id="270084" />

<Node id="270086" />'<Node id="270087" />He didn't look a bit like that this morning,' Oliver said.<Node id="270145" /> '<Node id="270147" />He just
surveyed everything, though he moved quickly enough when that foul
Tumulty creature was slashing round with a knife--at least, he told me
to move.<Node id="270301" />'<Node id="270302" />

<Node id="270304" />'<Node id="270305" />I think the best plan,' the Mayor said unheeding, 'would be for you to
go straight to him.<Node id="270395" /> <Node id="270396" />He may not, in his position, be able to do anything,
but he said in that article that law should be an exposition of, not an
imposition on, the people--so he may be more or less in sympathy.<Node id="270586" /> <Node id="270587" />Yes,
you go there--I had the address looked up--while I go to the Home
Secretary's; it's no use trying Whitehall--I'd better go to his private
house first.<Node id="270742" /> <Node id="270743" />If I can get no satisfaction....<Node id="270775" />'<Node id="270776" />

<Node id="270778" />'<Node id="270779" />Do you expect to?<Node id="270796" />' <Node id="270798" />Oliver asked.<Node id="270811" />

<Node id="270813" />The Mayor was silent for a few minutes, then he said quite quietly, 'No,
I don't.<Node id="270894" /> <Node id="270895" />I expect there'll be trouble before we get our way.<Node id="270946" /> <Node id="270947" />That's why
I want to know about the Chief Justice.<Node id="270997" /> <Node id="270998" />If he's on our side it will help
us amazingly.<Node id="271044" />'<Node id="271045" />

<Node id="271047" />Oliver tried to imagine the large placid form who had sat comfortably
opposite him at the conference leading the crowd from Rich-by-the-Mere
to attack London.<Node id="271205" /> <Node id="271206" />But though that picture faded too quickly, he realized
as he thought that the assistance of the Chief Justice would give the
riot an emblem of authority which would transform it into a rebellion.<Node id="271401" />
<Node id="271402" />Only he couldn't see Lord Arglay doing it, and he was no nearer to
seeing it when the Mayor turned him out of the car at Lancaster Gate
and went off, leaving him staring at the front door which concealed the
Justice of England.<Node id="271629" /> <Node id="271630" />The Justice of England, he reflected, might be out;
nothing in the present state of things was more probable.<Node id="271739" /> <Node id="271740" />A little more
cheerfully he rang the bell, and his hopes were defeated.<Node id="271811" /> <Node id="271812" />The maid would
see if Lord Arglay was at home.<Node id="271858" /> <Node id="271859" />Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="271873" /> <Node id="271874" />Would he take a seat?<Node id="271895" />

<Node id="271897" />'<Node id="271898" />Doncaster?<Node id="271908" />' <Node id="271910" />Lord Arglay said, looking at Chloe.<Node id="271945" /> '<Node id="271947" />Doncaster?<Node id="271957" /> <Node id="271958" />Ought I
to....<Node id="271972" /> <Node id="271973" />I do, vaguely.<Node id="271987" />'<Node id="271988" />

<Node id="271990" />'<Node id="271991" />I think he was there this morning,' Chloe said, 'Just a minute.<Node id="272054" />' <Node id="272056" />She
looked among her papers.<Node id="272084" /> '<Node id="272086" />Yes, he was.<Node id="272098" /> <Node id="272099" />I made a list of their names in
case they should be useful.<Node id="272158" />'<Node id="272159" />

<Node id="272161" />'<Node id="272162" />I sometimes think,' Arglay said, glancing down the slip of paper she
gave him, 'that the law of cause and effect isn't really understood.<Node id="272299" />
<Node id="272300" />Since whatever you do is bound to be justified, justification is
produced.<Node id="272374" /> <Node id="272375" />This Mr. Doncaster comes merely as a result of your having
written down his name.<Node id="272456" /> <Node id="272457" />Shall we ask him what he thinks--poor deluded
wretch!<Node id="272510" />--<Node id="272512" />made him call here?<Node id="272531" />'<Node id="272532" />

<Node id="272534" />They had, at the moment of Oliver's arrival, been arguing whether it
was safe for Chloe to go home alone.<Node id="272639" /> <Node id="272640" />She had wished to go as usual; the
Chief Justice had offered his car, his servants ('though none of them,'
he put in, 'would be useful'), and himself to take her.<Node id="272802" /> <Node id="272803" />Alternatively,
was there no friend she could telephone to, who could call at the house
and look after her.<Node id="272909" /> '<Node id="272911" />If you won't stop here, that is.<Node id="272943" />'<Node id="272944" />

<Node id="272946" />But this, considering that the servants knew nothing of the crisis, and
considering also matters of dress and convenience, Chloe declined to do.<Node id="273090" />
<Node id="273091" />She was more uncertain about summoning Mr. Lindsay.<Node id="273142" /> <Node id="273143" />Frank _had_ been
rather badly treated--and he was almost certain to be in, working--and
he would love to be called on.<Node id="273261" /> <Node id="273262" />Ought she to give him the pleasure?<Node id="273297" /> '<Node id="273299" />But
we should have to tell him,' she said aloud, half-unconsciously.<Node id="273367" />

<Node id="273369" />'<Node id="273370" />The papers,' Lord Arglay said, 'have already done a good deal of that.<Node id="273440" />
<Node id="273441" />And a friend of yours----' with a gesture he opened the secret to her
friend's entrance.<Node id="273529" />

<Node id="273531" />Duty could sometimes be pleasure, Chloe thought looking at him, and
certainly pleasure sometimes looked remarkably like duty.<Node id="273656" /> <Node id="273657" />Still ...<Node id="273666" />
<Node id="273667" />after all, Frank _had_ had a difficult Saturday.<Node id="273715" /> <Node id="273716" />And nothing at all of a
Sunday, since she had refused to stir out for fear she might be wanted.<Node id="273811" />
<Node id="273812" />After a brief explanation therefore she got through to Frank, offered a
tepid request, and came back feeling unexpectedly gloomy.<Node id="273941" /> <Node id="273942" />It was then
that Oliver had arrived.<Node id="273978" />

<Node id="273980" />'<Node id="273981" />Yes, O yes,' Chloe said, 'I should ask him.<Node id="274024" /> <Node id="274025" />I'll go and wait for Mr.
Lindsay in the hall.<Node id="274070" />' <Node id="274072" />That, she felt, described her existence--she would
always be waiting for someone in the hall.<Node id="274165" /> <Node id="274166" />While the great people talked
in studies and drawing-rooms.<Node id="274225" /> <Node id="274226" />She rather hoped Frank wouldn't come, then
she could get off by herself before the Chief Justice had finished with
this Mr. Doncaster.<Node id="274360" /> <Node id="274361" />What was the shortest time she could decently wait?<Node id="274412" />

<Node id="274414" />'<Node id="274415" />Show Mr. Doncaster in,' Lord Arglay said to the maid.<Node id="274468" /> '<Node id="274470" />And when a Mr.
Lindsay whom I'm expecting comes, show _him_ in.<Node id="274533" /> <Node id="274534" />If,' he went on to
Chloe, 'this fellow has anything really secret I'll take him away, while
you tell your friend as much as you choose of the story.<Node id="274682" /> <Node id="274683" />If you can
remember it, which is more than I shall be able to do soon.<Node id="274753" /> <Node id="274754" />I do wish
I knew what, if anything, had happened at Birmingham.<Node id="274817" /> <Node id="274818" />If that fellow
Pondon has come back what a difficulty he'll have explaining to the
police!<Node id="274908" /> <Node id="274909" />Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="274923" /> <Node id="274924" />Why yes, I remember you this morning now--Miss
Burnett, if you remember Miss Burnett, remembered you before.<Node id="275032" /> <Node id="275033" />Do sit
down.<Node id="275045" />'<Node id="275046" />

<Node id="275048" />'<Node id="275049" />Thank you very much, Lord Arglay,' Oliver said, obeying.<Node id="275105" />

<Node id="275107" />'<Node id="275108" />An extraordinary business, isn't it?<Node id="275144" />' <Node id="275146" />the Chief Justice went on.<Node id="275172" /> '<Node id="275174" />How
goes your end?<Node id="275192" />--<Node id="275194" />whichever _is_ your end.<Node id="275218" /> <Node id="275219" />For I'm ashamed to say I am not
quite clear what party you are of, so to speak.<Node id="275298" /> <Node id="275299" />Mr. Sheldrake's, wasn't
it?<Node id="275326" />'<Node id="275327" />

<Node id="275329" />Oliver crossed his legs.<Node id="275353" /> '<Node id="275355" />I represent,' he said gravely, 'the people.<Node id="275398" />
<Node id="275399" />I am the autos of their autocratic mouth.<Node id="275440" /> <Node id="275441" />I am the sovereign will.<Node id="275465" /> <Node id="275466" />I
am....<Node id="275474" />' <Node id="275476" />The solemn tone of his mock proclamation faded, and he ended,
lamely and seriously, 'the people.<Node id="275572" />'<Node id="275573" />

<Node id="275575" />Lord Arglay observed the change of tone and looked at him carefully.<Node id="275643" />
'<Node id="275645" />And how do the people come in?<Node id="275675" />' <Node id="275677" />he asked.<Node id="275686" />

<Node id="275688" />Oliver, as best he could, explained.<Node id="275724" /> <Node id="275725" />As he began he felt a fool, but
his eyes lit on the strip of black silk across Chloe's hand--she had
declined to attempt to heal it by the Stone--and he derived therefrom a
certain strength.<Node id="275915" /> <Node id="275916" />After all, this girl had knocked the Professor over
and attacked Sir Giles; she had thrust herself across the will of that
unpleasant little beast.<Node id="276063" /> <Node id="276064" />And Sir Giles had been left with Sheldrake at
the Foreign Office when the rest of them were turned out.<Node id="276167" /> <Node id="276168" />And the people
were clamouring for life and health from that Mystery which the police,
on behalf of the American, had pouched.<Node id="276294" />

<Node id="276296" />'<Node id="276297" />I don't quite see,' Lord Arglay said when he had done, 'on what grounds
you asserted so strongly that I disapproved of the Government.<Node id="276431" />'<Node id="276432" />

<Node id="276434" />'<Node id="276435" />Well, sir,' Oliver said, 'I thought you approved of Miss Burnett.<Node id="276500" />'<Node id="276501" />

<Node id="276503" />'<Node id="276504" />I always approve of Miss Burnett,' Arglay answered.<Node id="276555" /> '<Node id="276557" />It would be
temperamentally impossible to me to have a secretary of whom I
disapproved.<Node id="276644" /> <Node id="276645" />But approving of Miss Burnett has not, from the beginning,
been necessarily equivalent to disapproving of the Government.<Node id="276766" />'<Node id="276767" />

<Node id="276769" />'<Node id="276770" />But in this case, sir...<Node id="276794" />?' <Node id="276797" />Oliver suggested.<Node id="276814" />

<Node id="276816" />The Chief Justice shook his head.<Node id="276849" /> '<Node id="276851" />No, no,' he said.<Node id="276868" /> '<Node id="276870" />In the first place
I don't know what they are doing; in the second, I neither approve nor
disapprove of governments, but of men, and that only according to the
order and decision of the laws.<Node id="277061" /> <Node id="277062" />I am a chair, Mr. Doncaster, not a
horse--not even Rosinante.<Node id="277123" />'<Node id="277124" />

<Node id="277126" />'<Node id="277127" />But if Don Quixote came before the chair?<Node id="277168" />' <Node id="277170" />Oliver asked.<Node id="277183" />

<Node id="277185" />'<Node id="277186" />I should think he is very likely to, if he goes on as he is at
present,' Arglay said drily.<Node id="277277" /> '<Node id="277279" />But even then--Don Quixote or Don Juan or
the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador--it is all one.<Node id="277367" /> <Node id="277368" />I have not eyes to see
nor mouth to speak but as the laws shall direct me.<Node id="277442" />'<Node id="277443" />

<Node id="277445" />'<Node id="277446" />But if it is a case beyond any law?<Node id="277481" />' <Node id="277483" />Oliver said.<Node id="277495" />

<Node id="277497" />'<Node id="277498" />There is no case beyond law,' the Chief Justice answered.<Node id="277555" /> '<Node id="277557" />We may
mistake in the ruling, we may be deceived by outward things and cunning
talk, but there is no dispute between men which cannot be resolved in
equity.<Node id="277713" /> <Node id="277714" />And in its nature equity is from those between whom it exists:
it is passion acting in lucidity.<Node id="277810" />'<Node id="277811" />

<Node id="277813" />'<Node id="277814" />Mr.<Node id="277817" /> <Node id="277818" />Lindsay,' the maid said, opening the door.<Node id="277860" /> <Node id="277861" />Chloe stood up swiftly
and went forward to meet him, and as she did so it seemed to Oliver as
if Arglay's last phrase took on a sudden human meaning.<Node id="278010" /> <Node id="278011" />A vivid presence
passed him, and he found himself gravely reconstructing the meaning of
those words.<Node id="278111" /> <Node id="278112" />On a sudden impulse he turned to Lord Arglay.<Node id="278157" /> '<Node id="278159" />Is that what
you would call Miss Burnett's action this morning?<Node id="278222" />' <Node id="278224" />he asked.<Node id="278233" />

<Node id="278235" />For a moment the Chief Justice frowned; it appeared to him unnecessary
that this Mr. Doncaster should remark on anything Chloe had chosen to
do.<Node id="278379" /> <Node id="278380" />But the neatness of the phrase placated him; he looked at Oliver
with cautious but appreciative eyes.<Node id="278481" /> '<Node id="278483" />I will admit, at least,' he said,
'that, entirely as a private man, I regard Giles Tumulty as something
very nearly without the law.<Node id="278615" />' <Node id="278617" />He stepped forward to meet Frank.<Node id="278650" />

<Node id="278652" />The half-hour which followed was not one on which Chloe looked back,
for some time, without growing hot.<Node id="278756" /> <Node id="278757" />It was largely, she felt, Mr.
Doncaster's fault for arriving so late; it was largely Frank's for
arriving so soon.<Node id="278871" /> <Node id="278872" />He had been dragged from his surveyor's studies to
take her home, and she didn't want to go--not until she knew whether
this Mayor was coming.<Node id="279014" /> <Node id="279015" />But if she didn't go at once she must explain,
and how could she explain in front of Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="279114" /> <Node id="279115" />And why did Frank
look so _dull_?<Node id="279148" /> <Node id="279149" />And why, in an effort to be conversational, must he ask
her at once if she had hurt her hand?<Node id="279242" /> <Node id="279243" />And why was the Chief Justice
displaying a remote intention of leaving her to talk to Frank while he
went back to Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="279371" /> <Node id="279372" />She managed to introduce them, in order (by
the exercise of a certain dexterity which she was uneasily conscious
Lord Arglay patiently humoured), to move the conversation--it was no
more lightly done--on to the common subject of Mr. Sheldrake.<Node id="279615" /> <Node id="279616" />But it
continually showed signs of breaking into two halves, and at the end
of about a quarter of an hour she began wretchedly to make the first
preparations for departure.<Node id="279788" /> <Node id="279789" />She put one or two papers together, she
opened her handbag, and saw within it the white silk handkerchief in
which her Type of the Stone had been wrapped.<Node id="279943" /> <Node id="279944" />Under cover of a monologue
of Lord Arglay's she pushed aside the soft opaqueness and gazed at the
Mystery.<Node id="280050" /> <Node id="280051" />Nothing, she thought, had ever looked more feebly useless, more
dull and dead, than that bit of white stone.<Node id="280159" /> <Node id="280160" />The flakings were not gold,
they were yellow; they were obviously merely accidental and it was only
a perverse fancy that could see in the black smudges the tracing of the
Divine Name.<Node id="280344" /> <Node id="280345" />She put her hand down sharply to cover it again, and found
that her fingers were unwilling to move.<Node id="280444" /> <Node id="280445" />Dared she so, in action, deny
the Stone?<Node id="280485" /> <Node id="280486" />Thought was multitudinous but action single.<Node id="280530" /> <Node id="280531" />A pushing aside
or a ritual veiling?<Node id="280567" />--<Node id="280569" />one it must be.<Node id="280584" /> <Node id="280585" />Nobody could see or know what
she did, yet she felt as if an expectancy lay around, as if something
waited, docile but immortal, the consequences of her choice.<Node id="280745" /> '<Node id="280747" />Cowardly
fool!<Node id="280761" />' <Node id="280763" />Chloe said to herself and, so protesting against her own action,
drew Lord Arglay's handkerchief ceremonially over the Stone.<Node id="280888" />

<Node id="280890" />In spite of her delay she had reluctantly gone, attended by Mr.
Lindsay, before the Mayor of Rich arrived at Lancaster Gate.<Node id="281014" /> <Node id="281015" />He was
shown in at once and Oliver, hastily presenting him to the Chief
Justice, said urgently: 'Well, what happened?<Node id="281132" />'<Node id="281133" />

<Node id="281135" />The Mayor answered slowly: 'I have had to remind the Home Secretary that
the office of Mayor is filled, not by the decision of the Government,
but by the choice of the people.<Node id="281310" />'<Node id="281311" />

<Node id="281313" />'<Node id="281314" />Have you indeed?<Node id="281330" />' <Node id="281332" />Oliver said.<Node id="281344" />

<Node id="281346" />'<Node id="281347" />I had some difficulty in getting to see him,' the Mayor went on,
'and when I did he was bent on assuring me that the matter was being
dealt with.<Node id="281492" /> <Node id="281493" />I pressed him to tell me more.<Node id="281523" /> <Node id="281524" />I pointed out that I was
responsible for order in the town, and that the effect of maintaining
secrecy would be highly damaging.<Node id="281652" /> <Node id="281653" />We had a long discussion and in the
end I was compelled to point out to him that, if no satisfactory
statement were made, I should be driven to place the resources of the
mayoralty at the disposal of any constitutional agitation that might
arise.<Node id="281899" /> <Node id="281900" />I was very careful to say "constitutional.<Node id="281942" />" <Node id="281944" />It was then that he
threatened me with removal and I reminded him that the Mayors came by
vote of the Town Council who are chosen by the people.<Node id="282088" />'<Node id="282089" />




<Node id="282094" />CHAPTER XI<Node id="282104" />

<Node id="282106" />THE FIRST REFUSAL OF CHLOE BURNETT<Node id="282140" />


<Node id="282143" />Chloe's chief regret, when she and Frank got out of her bus at Highgate,
was that there was a quarter of an hour's walk before them.<Node id="282275" /> <Node id="282276" />She made a
half-hearted effort--half-hearted on his account as much as hers--to
persuade him to return at once, but when this failed she resigned
herself to his inevitable desire to discuss the whole matter.<Node id="282483" /> <Node id="282484" />Saturday
afternoon's experience, the Sunday papers, things said that evening,
had made it impossible to keep from him the secret of the Stone.<Node id="282626" /> <Node id="282627" />But,
accustomed to him as she was, she seemed to hear in his voice a hint of
anxiety which at first she attributed to his concern for her.<Node id="282765" />

<Node id="282767" />'<Node id="282768" />It shows you things in your mind?<Node id="282801" />' <Node id="282803" />he said as they turned a corner.<Node id="282835" />

<Node id="282837" />'<Node id="282838" />Apparently,' Chloe assented.<Node id="282866" /> '<Node id="282868" />At least, it showed Lord Arglay Sir
Giles's mind.<Node id="282917" />'<Node id="282918" />

<Node id="282920" />He was silent for a minute or two.<Node id="282954" /> <Node id="282955" />Then: 'Tells you things?<Node id="282979" />' <Node id="282981" />he went on,
following his own thoughts.<Node id="283020" />

<Node id="283022" />Chloe considered.<Node id="283039" /> '<Node id="283041" />Tells you?<Node id="283051" />' <Node id="283053" />she asked at last.<Node id="283071" />

<Node id="283073" />'<Node id="283074" />Things you mightn't know--or might have forgotten,' he answered.<Node id="283138" /> '<Node id="283140" />It
would make things clear to you, wouldn't it?<Node id="283187" /> <Node id="283188" />If it shows you thoughts.<Node id="283213" />'<Node id="283214" />

<Node id="283216" />'<Node id="283217" />I suppose it might,' Chloe said, rather vague about what he meant and
a little irritated at her vagueness.<Node id="283323" /> <Node id="283324" />There was another short silence.<Node id="283356" />

<Node id="283358" />'<Node id="283359" />And it can be separated?<Node id="283383" />' <Node id="283385" />Frank said.<Node id="283396" />

<Node id="283398" />'<Node id="283399" />No,' said Chloe firmly, 'it can't.<Node id="283433" /> <Node id="283434" />Or only by people like Sir Giles.<Node id="283467" />'<Node id="283468" />

<Node id="283470" />The pause after this began to annoy her; the conversation was going in
spasms like hiccups.<Node id="283561" /> '<Node id="283563" />Let's talk of something else,' she said.<Node id="283603" /> '<Node id="283605" />It's
only a month to the exam.<Node id="283635" />, <Node id="283637" />isn't it?<Node id="283646" /> <Node id="283647" />I do hope you'll get through.<Node id="283676" />'<Node id="283677" />

<Node id="283679" />'<Node id="283680" />I suppose,' he answered lightly, 'you wouldn't like to lend me the
Stone?<Node id="283753" />'<Node id="283754" />

<Node id="283756" />'<Node id="283757" />To----' Chloe stared.<Node id="283778" /> '<Node id="283780" />The Stone?<Node id="283790" /> <Node id="283791" />Whatever for?<Node id="283804" />'<Node id="283805" />

<Node id="283807" />'<Node id="283808" />Well,' said Frank, 'if it shows you things--I mean, if it helps the
mind, the memory or whatever ...<Node id="283908" /> <Node id="283909" />well, don't you see--if one could
remember at the right time----' He made a second's pause and went on
'That's where an examination's so unfair; one can't remember everything
just at the minute and just forgetting one single fact or formula that
one knows perfectly well throws the whole thing out.<Node id="284207" /> <Node id="284208" />It isn't even a
case of wanting to be sure one would remember, because one _would_
remember if one didn't forget--I mean, if one wasn't afraid of
forgetting.<Node id="284365" /> <Node id="284366" />It isn't, in that way, as if there was any unfairness.<Node id="284420" /> <Node id="284421" />I
wouldn't dream of taking an unfair advantage; it wouldn't really be
doing more than taking an aspirin if one had a headache on the day.<Node id="284558" />
<Node id="284559" />Lots of the fellows have mnemonics--it'd only be feeling that one had
a pretty good system.<Node id="284650" /> <Node id="284651" />It isn't as if----'<Node id="284670" />

<Node id="284672" />'<Node id="284673" />Frank, do _stop_,' Chloe said.<Node id="284703" /> '<Node id="284705" />What is it you want?<Node id="284725" />'<Node id="284726" />

<Node id="284728" />'<Node id="284729" />I've just told you,' Frank said.<Node id="284761" /> '<Node id="284763" />Would you lend me the Stone just till
after my exam.<Node id="284815" />?'<Node id="284817" />

<Node id="284819" />'<Node id="284820" />No, I wouldn't,' Chloe answered.<Node id="284852" /> '<Node id="284854" />I'm sorry, Frank, but I really
can't.<Node id="284891" />'<Node id="284892" />

<Node id="284894" />'<Node id="284895" />Well--if you don't want to part with yours--I quite understand--would
you ...<Node id="284972" /> <Node id="284973" />make one for me?<Node id="284989" />' <Node id="284991" />Frank asked.<Node id="285003" /> '<Node id="285005" />You know how important it is for
me to get through, darling.<Node id="285065" /> <Node id="285066" />I don't know what'll happen if I muff it.<Node id="285107" />'<Node id="285108" />

<Node id="285110" />'<Node id="285111" />I suppose you'll go in again,' Chloe said, anger growing within her.<Node id="285179" /> <Node id="285180" />It
was only, she warned herself, that Frank didn't--and, not knowing all
about it, couldn't--understand.<Node id="285284" /> <Node id="285285" />But nobody--nobody--did understand, she
least of all.<Node id="285338" />

<Node id="285340" />'<Node id="285341" />Well--perhaps,' Frank said, defeated by this realism.<Node id="285394" /> '<Node id="285396" />But it'd be
much more convenient to get through at once.<Node id="285452" /> <Node id="285453" />It might mean a great deal
more than a year later on--it gives one a better chance.<Node id="285536" />' <Node id="285538" />Chloe made
a small effort.<Node id="285564" /> '<Node id="285566" />Dear Frank,' she said, 'I hate to seem a pig, but I
couldn't ...<Node id="285630" /> <Node id="285631" />I couldn't do that--not with the Stone.<Node id="285670" />'<Node id="285671" />

<Node id="285673" />'<Node id="285674" />But it wouldn't be unfair,' Frank urged.<Node id="285714" /> '<Node id="285716" />Anyone who can manage any way
of remembering things does--short of writing them down.<Node id="285801" /> <Node id="285802" />It's only just
to safeguard the mind against a sort of stage-fright; just a sort of ...<Node id="285889" />
<Node id="285890" />of ...<Node id="285896" /> <Node id="285897" />cooling-mixture.<Node id="285913" />'<Node id="285914" />

<Node id="285916" />'<Node id="285917" />O God,' Chloe said suddenly, 'is there no end?<Node id="285963" />'<Node id="285964" />

<Node id="285966" />Frank looked at her in a hurt surprise.<Node id="286005" /> '<Node id="286007" />I shouldn't think I was asking
very much,' he said, 'not if you really want me to pass.<Node id="286094" /> <Node id="286095" />You might know
that I wouldn't ask you to do anything unfair.<Node id="286156" /> <Node id="286157" />It doesn't put me in a
better position; it only prevents me being in a worse.<Node id="286234" /> <Node id="286235" />They'd all do as
much if they could.<Node id="286271" />'<Node id="286272" />

<Node id="286274" />'<Node id="286275" />I don't care if they would or not.<Node id="286309" /> <Node id="286310" />I don't care whether it's right or
fair or whatever you call it or not,' Chloe answered.<Node id="286398" /> '<Node id="286400" />Frank, do try and
see it.<Node id="286425" /> <Node id="286426" />It's just that we can't use the Stone like that.<Node id="286474" />'<Node id="286475" />

<Node id="286477" />'<Node id="286478" />But why not?<Node id="286490" />' <Node id="286492" />Frank asked in mere bewilderment.<Node id="286525" /> '<Node id="286527" />If it can do all those
things?<Node id="286557" /> <Node id="286558" />Your Lord Arglay's been using it, hasn't he?<Node id="286602" />'<Node id="286603" />

<Node id="286605" />'<Node id="286606" />Not for himself,' Chloe answered.<Node id="286639" />

<Node id="286641" />'<Node id="286642" />But I'm not asking you to use it for yourself.<Node id="286688" /> <Node id="286689" />It's really an unselfish
thing you'd be doing in lending it to me, or giving me one,' Frank
urged.<Node id="286787" /> '<Node id="286789" />I did think you'd like me to pass--but I suppose you don't care
about that either.<Node id="286871" />'<Node id="286872" />

<Node id="286874" />'<Node id="286875" />Don't be beastly, Frank,' Chloe said.<Node id="286912" />

<Node id="286914" />'<Node id="286915" />It doesn't look much like it, anyhow,' the misguided Frank went
on.<Node id="286982" /> '<Node id="286984" />You don't seem to mind other people being helped--and I don't
understand _why_ you won't.<Node id="287073" /> <Node id="287074" />You've always been out to make the best
of your chances, and you won't do the same for me.<Node id="287164" /> <Node id="287165" />You'd use it quick
enough to save yourself being sacked, I expect.<Node id="287231" />'<Node id="287232" />

<Node id="287234" />'<Node id="287235" />I wouldn't,' Chloe said sharply.<Node id="287267" /> '<Node id="287269" />I wouldn't use it to buy myself food
if I was starving.<Node id="287324" />'<Node id="287325" />

<Node id="287327" />'<Node id="287328" />O don't talk rubbish,' Frank said and fell into sullenness.<Node id="287387" />

<Node id="287389" />They walked on silently.<Node id="287413" /> <Node id="287414" />He had dropped her arm or she had dropped his;
anyhow, they were disjoined.<Node id="287489" /> <Node id="287490" />Her hands were empty but for the handbag,
and in that ridiculous bag the absurd Cause.<Node id="287576" /> <Node id="287577" />It seemed from its
seclusion to taunt her.<Node id="287619" /> '<Node id="287621" />Throw me away,' it seemed to be saying, 'throw
me into the gutter.<Node id="287687" /> <Node id="287688" />Am I worth all this trouble?<Node id="287716" />' <Node id="287718" />It wouldn't, she
thought, with a touch of sanity, please Frank any better if she did--not
Frank.<Node id="287814" /> <Node id="287815" />He wouldn't appreciate the gesture.<Node id="287850" /> <Node id="287851" />Besides, it wasn't her
business to throw it away.<Node id="287900" /> '<Node id="287902" />I am yours,' the Stone gibed at her, 'your
own--throw me away.<Node id="287964" /> <Node id="287965" />You're in danger of throwing him away.<Node id="288003" />' <Node id="288005" />From
somewhere her memory brought up a text--'My lovers and friends hast thou
set afar from me; and hid my acquaintance out of my sight.<Node id="288141" />' <Node id="288143" />She didn't
want him to go like this.<Node id="288179" />

<Node id="288181" />'<Node id="288182" />Darling,' she breathed tentatively, 'don't be cross.<Node id="288234" /> <Node id="288235" />I'd do anything I
could.<Node id="288259" />'<Node id="288260" />

<Node id="288262" />'<Node id="288263" />That,' said Frank coldly, 'isn't true, Chloe.<Node id="288308" /> <Node id="288309" />It's a quite simple thing
and you won't do it.<Node id="288355" /> <Node id="288356" />Very well; it's your Stone.<Node id="288383" /> <Node id="288384" />But it's no good saying
you'd do it if you could.<Node id="288433" /> <Node id="288434" />You can and you won't.<Node id="288456" />'<Node id="288457" />

<Node id="288459" />'<Node id="288460" />Do it,' something said to her, 'do it.<Node id="288498" /> <Node id="288499" />Why ever not?<Node id="288512" /> <Node id="288513" />Are you
setting up to know what's right?<Node id="288553" /> <Node id="288554" />Do it, and be a real friend to him.<Node id="288589" />'
<Node id="288591" />Friendship--after all, ought she to do for her friend what she wouldn't
do for herself?<Node id="288678" /> <Node id="288679" />Ought she to break her heart and do it?<Node id="288718" /> <Node id="288719" />Was it only her
own wish she was safeguarding?<Node id="288765" />

<Node id="288767" />From her own point of view it was by the mercy of the Stone that Frank
said again at this moment, with a touch of superior and angry
rationalism--'Yes, you can and you won't.<Node id="288941" />'<Node id="288942" />

<Node id="288944" />'<Node id="288945" />Very well then,' Chloe said, stopping dead.<Node id="288988" /> '<Node id="288990" />I can and I won't.<Node id="289008" /> <Node id="289009" />And now
go away.<Node id="289025" /> <Node id="289026" />Go away or I shall hate you.<Node id="289054" /> <Node id="289055" />Go.<Node id="289058" />'<Node id="289059" />

<Node id="289061" />'<Node id="289062" />I prefer to see you right home,' Frank said formally.<Node id="289115" />

<Node id="289117" />'<Node id="289118" />I don't want you to,' Chloe said.<Node id="289151" /> '<Node id="289153" />I can't bear it.<Node id="289169" /> <Node id="289170" />O Frank, do go.<Node id="289185" />'<Node id="289186" />

<Node id="289188" />'<Node id="289189" />I don't want to be nasty,' he said irresolutely, 'but I can't see why
you won't.<Node id="289269" /> <Node id="289270" />I've explained to you that it wouldn't be unfair.<Node id="289319" />'<Node id="289320" />

<Node id="289322" />'<Node id="289323" />I know, I know,' Chloe said.<Node id="289351" /> '<Node id="289353" />Good-night.<Node id="289364" /> <Node id="289365" />I'll write to-morrow.<Node id="289386" />'<Node id="289387" />

<Node id="289389" />'<Node id="289390" />O well, good-night,' Frank answered, and found himself looking after
her in a temper of which he had never imagined she could be the cause.<Node id="289529" />
'<Node id="289531" />So ridiculous,' he thought; 'women never can reason clearly, but I did
think she was more intelligent.<Node id="289633" /> <Node id="289634" />It isn't very much to ask her to do for
anyone she professes to like.<Node id="289703" /> <Node id="289704" />But it's always the same; everybody wants
to have their own way.<Node id="289768" />'<Node id="289769" />

<Node id="289771" />Still meditating on the insufficiency of human virtue he turned back
towards the terminus at the bottom of Highgate Hill.<Node id="289892" /> <Node id="289893" />Anxious, however,
as he might be, to see Chloe's point of view, it eluded him with
persistent ingenuity.<Node id="289997" /> <Node id="289998" />As a friend, as something--well, different from a
friend--she ought to have wanted to help him.<Node id="290093" /> <Node id="290094" />Not that he found it easy
to accept the Stone, but his incredulity was a good deal intimidated by
the sudden arrival of Mrs. Sheldrake on the Saturday, the columns of
the Sunday papers, the rather mysterious position of Lord Arglay, and
Chloe's own great concern with it.<Node id="290365" /> <Node id="290366" />He thought rather vaguely of radium,
vita-glass, magnetism, and psycho-analysis, the possibility of some
quickening power exercised on the brain, or some revitalization of the
nervous functions.<Node id="290560" /> <Node id="290561" />The last phrase appeared plausible enough to cover
all instances of recovery to health and what--so far as he could
see--was a sort of mind-reading.<Node id="290709" /> <Node id="290710" />As for movement in space ...<Node id="290738" /> <Node id="290739" />perhaps it
was hardly so satisfactory there.<Node id="290783" /> <Node id="290784" />Nervous functions would have to be
thoroughly vitalized in order----<Node id="290852" />

<Node id="290854" />A fresh voice interrupted him.<Node id="290884" /> <Node id="290885" />He looked up to see another friend--but
this time a young man.<Node id="290947" />

<Node id="290949" />'<Node id="290950" />Hullo, Carnegie,' he said gloomily.<Node id="290985" />

<Node id="290987" />Albert Carnegie looked at him with an irritating cheerfulness.<Node id="291049" />

<Node id="291051" />'<Node id="291052" />What's the gloom about?<Node id="291075" />' <Node id="291077" />he asked.<Node id="291086" /> '<Node id="291088" />Why the misery?<Node id="291103" />'<Node id="291104" />

<Node id="291106" />'<Node id="291107" />I'm not miserable,' Lindsay said perversely.<Node id="291151" /> '<Node id="291153" />Why should I be
miserable?<Node id="291179" />'<Node id="291180" />

<Node id="291182" />'<Node id="291183" />Sorry,' Carnegie answered.<Node id="291209" /> '<Node id="291211" />I thought you were looking a bit under the
weather.<Node id="291262" />'<Node id="291263" />

<Node id="291265" />'<Node id="291266" />It's this damned examination, I expect,' Lindsay said.<Node id="291320" /> '<Node id="291322" />I've been
sticking to it close enough, these last days.<Node id="291377" />'<Node id="291378" />

<Node id="291380" />Carnegie turned.<Node id="291396" /> '<Node id="291398" />I'll walk back with you,' he said.<Node id="291432" /> '<Node id="291434" />How's Miss
Burnett?<Node id="291453" />'<Node id="291454" />

<Node id="291456" />'<Node id="291457" />Well enough, I suppose,' Miss Burnett's friend answered.<Node id="291513" /> '<Node id="291515" />But she's got
mixed up with all the business about this Stone in the papers, and she's
a bit on edge about it.<Node id="291625" />'<Node id="291626" />

<Node id="291628" />'<Node id="291629" />What, the Stone that makes people well?<Node id="291668" />' <Node id="291670" />Carnegie asked.<Node id="291685" />

<Node id="291687" />'<Node id="291688" />Makes anyone do anything,' Lindsay told him, 'so far as I can
understand.<Node id="291761" /> <Node id="291762" />Makes people fly or jump or see into each other's minds, so
they say.<Node id="291831" />'<Node id="291832" />

<Node id="291834" />'<Node id="291835" />Fly!<Node id="291839" />' <Node id="291841" />the other exclaimed.<Node id="291861" />

<Node id="291863" />'<Node id="291864" />Well, if you don't call getting from one place to another in
practically no time flying, I don't know what you do call it,' Lindsay
said.<Node id="292001" /> '<Node id="292003" />And I saw something like it happen myself, so I can't say it's
all tripe.<Node id="292076" />'<Node id="292077" />

<Node id="292079" />'<Node id="292080" />Do you mean you saw someone move through the air by using this Stone?<Node id="292149" />'
<Node id="292151" />Carnegie asked.<Node id="292166" />

<Node id="292168" />'<Node id="292169" />I saw a woman suddenly appear where she hadn't been--and Chloe says
she's seen it done, seen Lord Arglay disappear and reappear and have
been somewhere in between.<Node id="292332" /> <Node id="292333" />It all sounds nonsensical enough, but what
with what I saw and Chloe and the papers together I don't know what to
think.<Node id="292453" />'<Node id="292454" />

<Node id="292456" />Carnegie walked on for some distance in silence, his mind occupied with
a side of the question which had so far only occurred to Mr. Sheldrake
and Reginald Montague and to them in a limited sense.<Node id="292652" /> <Node id="292653" />But Carnegie's
occupation happened to be in the headquarters of the National Transport
Union, and while Lindsay was talking there came to him the idea that
if--only if, because of course there couldn't--but _if_ there were
anything to it, then it was the sort of it that the General Secretary of
the Union would think was most distinctly his own business.<Node id="293008" /> <Node id="293009" />Any violent
disturbance of transport would be, and this would be a very violent
disturbance.<Node id="293101" /> <Node id="293102" />At least if there were more than one, or perhaps a few
Stones.<Node id="293164" /> <Node id="293165" />It was against nature that there should be more.<Node id="293213" />

<Node id="293215" />'<Node id="293216" />I suppose there are only one or two Stones in existence, so far as we
know?<Node id="293291" />' <Node id="293293" />he said in a few minutes, as casually as possible.<Node id="293343" />

<Node id="293345" />'<Node id="293346" />It doesn't seem to matter,' Lindsay answered, still brooding over his
grievance.<Node id="293426" /> <Node id="293427" />He broke into a short explanation of his desires and was
gratified by the concentration with which Carnegie listened.<Node id="293544" /> '<Node id="293546" />So that,'
he ended, 'I really don't think it's too much to suggest.<Node id="293613" /> <Node id="293614" />It gives her
no trouble and no one could call it unfair.<Node id="293670" />'<Node id="293671" />

<Node id="293673" />'<Node id="293674" />And every single one of these things has the same power?<Node id="293730" />' <Node id="293732" />Carnegie
asked.<Node id="293747" />

<Node id="293749" />'<Node id="293750" />I know it's all ridiculous, but that's their story,' Lindsay agreed.<Node id="293818" />
'<Node id="293820" />So one would think that Chloe...<Node id="293852" />'<Node id="293853" />

<Node id="293855" />'<Node id="293856" />And who have got them now?<Node id="293882" />' <Node id="293884" />Carnegie interrupted.<Node id="293905" />

<Node id="293907" />'<Node id="293908" />Well, Chloe has, and this Sheldrake man, and Arglay I suppose ...<Node id="293973" /> <Node id="293974" />I
wish Chloe wasn't with Arglay; I think he's none too good an influence.<Node id="294047" />
<Node id="294048" />These lawyers are such hidebound pedants very often, and Chloe's rather
open to suggestion.<Node id="294139" /> <Node id="294140" />I don't mean that she's weak exactly, but she's
rather over-anxious to please, and doesn't take her own line sometimes
as strongly as she ought to.<Node id="294287" /> <Node id="294288" />Now she might have seen that in a thing
like this she ought to exercise her own judgement and not be dominated
by legal forms.<Node id="294414" />'<Node id="294415" />

<Node id="294417" />'<Node id="294418" />Yes,' said Carnegie, whom Chloe only interested at the moment as one
of the holders of the Stone.<Node id="294515" /> '<Node id="294517" />Anyhow there must be a good few knocking
about at the present moment, and more to be made at any time?<Node id="294619" />'<Node id="294620" />

<Node id="294622" />They had come out into the main road opposite a large _Evening News_
placard which announced 'Interview with Mrs. Ferguson.<Node id="294745" />' <Node id="294747" />Another close
by stated 'Where the Stone came from,' and a _Star_ placard 'The
Stone--Government Action.<Node id="294851" /> <Node id="294852" />Official.<Node id="294861" />' <Node id="294863" />The _Evening Standard's_ 'The
Situation at Rich' was comparatively out of date.<Node id="294942" /> <Node id="294943" />Carnegie looked at
them.<Node id="294967" /> <Node id="294968" />It might be, it certainly was, a hoax somehow or other, but even
as a hoax he thought the General Secretary would like to know.<Node id="295095" /> <Node id="295096" />The only
question was--now or in the morning?<Node id="295141" /> <Node id="295142" />At the Tube entrance he left
Lindsay who went on his way meditating over Chloe's perversity.<Node id="295234" />

<Node id="295236" />If he had been able to press his request again at that moment he might
have gained it.<Node id="295322" /> <Node id="295323" />For Chloe was lying in bed, miserable enough, and, with
her habitual disposition (as Mr. Lindsay had very nearly understood) to
wonder if she had behaved unkindly to others, was almost regretting her
firmness.<Node id="295532" /> <Node id="295533" />It seemed now so small a thing that Frank had wanted, and she
might have been merely selfishly one-ideaed--and her own ideaed--in
refusing him.<Node id="295676" /> <Node id="295677" />After all, Lord Arglay had made use of the Stone.<Node id="295726" /> <Node id="295727" />Yes, but
that _had_ been for someone else's good.<Node id="295776" /> <Node id="295777" />And had not she been asked only
to help another's good?<Node id="295832" /> <Node id="295833" />it wasn't her examination.<Node id="295859" /> <Node id="295860" />And would not Lord
Arglay have had her use it for her own good?<Node id="295923" /> <Node id="295924" />had not he bidden her use
it, if need were, if there were danger?<Node id="295989" /> <Node id="295990" />Yes, danger, but Frank's desire
to pass an examination could hardly be called danger.<Node id="296075" /> (<Node id="296077" />Besides even
in danger--could she?<Node id="296111" />) <Node id="296113" />She couldn't see Lord Arglay using it to make
himself Chief Justice, though he might to ensure a right judgement and
proper sentence.<Node id="296246" /> <Node id="296247" />But had she any right to inflict on Frank her own
interpretation of what the Chief Justice's will might be?<Node id="296354" /> <Node id="296355" />Frank had
no particular use for the Chief Justice.<Node id="296405" /> <Node id="296406" />It would be, she thought,
convenient if they could ask of Suleiman ben Daood himself what the
proper use of the Stone was, though even Suleiman, as far as she
remembered the legends she had studied a few days before, had fallen
sometimes from wisdom.<Node id="296656" /> <Node id="296657" />Asmodeus had sat on his throne, and Pharaoh's
daughter had deceived him, and he had built altars to strange gods.<Node id="296770" />
<Node id="296771" />She remembered Lord Arglay's bargain of that evening; was she
really supposed to be believing in God?<Node id="296872" /> <Node id="296873" />And if so, who?<Node id="296888" /> <Node id="296889" />or what?<Node id="296897" />
<Node id="296898" />Suleiman's?<Node id="296909" /> <Node id="296910" />Presumably.<Node id="296921" /> <Node id="296922" />Or Octavius C�sar's or Charlemagne's or
Haroun-al-Raschid's--supposing they all had one?<Node id="297010" /> <Node id="297011" />Or the Stone's own God?<Node id="297034" />

<Node id="297036" />Half-unconsciously her hand felt for it where it lay under her pillow
in its silken veil, and as she touched it sleep or some other healing
power flowed through her.<Node id="297201" /> <Node id="297202" />Asleep or awake, at once or after a long
time--it seemed both in the dream that possessed her--she seemed to see
before her a great depth of space that changed itself while she looked
into it and became a hall with carved pillars and a vast crowd surging
through it.<Node id="297468" /> <Node id="297469" />Far off she heard a roaring that grew louder and by its own
noise divided and ordered the crowd so that the many small scurrying
figures were heaped in masses on either side.<Node id="297643" /> <Node id="297644" />She felt herself somewhere
among them, but not in any one place; she was carried through them,
seeing all round her brown faces and long dark beards and bright turbans
and cloaks, the roaring still in her ears.<Node id="297854" /> <Node id="297855" />And then the crowd opened
before her and she saw suddenly the great centre of the whole, but first
in masses and only afterwards its own central height.<Node id="298007" /> <Node id="298008" />For to right and
left as she gazed there expanded huge gatherings of seated men: on the
one side men in the same cloaks and head-dresses she had already seen,
with little rolls or boxes fastened to their foreheads and wrists, and
some of them held antique parchment in their hands.<Node id="298289" /> <Node id="298290" />Their faces were
Jewish, and mostly very old and lined with much thought, only here and
there she saw one and another young and ardent and again one and another
still older than most but astonishingly full and clear and happy.<Node id="298516" /> <Node id="298517" />Over
against them, but with a broad aisle between them were another company,
in many different garbs and all unknown to her; or almost all, for among
the turbans and helmets and diadems she saw suddenly a Chinese mandarin
sitting gravely watchful, and another whose bearded face came to her as
if she had looked on it in a gallery of high statuary among divine heads
of Aphrodite and Apollo, of Theseus and Heracles and Aesclepius.<Node id="298948" /> <Node id="298949" />But
most of the rest were strange and terrible, only not so terrible as
those on whom her eyes next rested.<Node id="299056" /> <Node id="299057" />For beyond these, and again in two
opposing companies, she saw figures that seemed larger or lesser than
mortal man, and other figures who were of other natures and kept in them
only a faint image of humanity.<Node id="299266" /> <Node id="299267" />There a seeming fountain twisted its
ascending and descending waters into such a simulacrum, and there again
was one having many heads, and one again whose writhing arms encircled
him round and round and sometimes leapt forth and were again retrieved
till it seemed as if the ancient Kraken itself had become human.<Node id="299582" /> <Node id="299583" />Over
and among them flew many birds and by their flights her glance was drawn
upward till she saw that the whole roof of that place was formed of
birds, vibrating and rising and falling with persistent but unequal
motion, with colours gleaming and iridescent or dull and heavy.<Node id="299860" /> <Node id="299861" />In front
there hung immovable one huge monster of a bird like the father and lord
of all that are of the eagle and vulture tribe, with his eyes filmed and
his head and dreadful beak a little on one side as though he listened to
all he could not see.<Node id="300110" /> <Node id="300111" />And as she shuddered and looked down she saw below
him a number of huge lions' heads, and the red jaws opened in a terrific
roar as the beasts seemed, some to crouch before the spring, some to be
high-ramping in a wild fury.<Node id="300335" /> <Node id="300336" />In this last astonishment all former wonder
was swallowed up--and that she felt surprise and awe she knew even then,
and knew also that she did not truly dream, but even while the beasts
raged and roared there passed between them a note of music and a voice
sang 'Praise to the Eternal One; glory and honour and adoration be to
the Lord God of Israel; blessed be He!<Node id="300702" />' <Node id="300704" />and immediately the noise of the
beasts sounded in one answering roar and was still, and they also.<Node id="300803" /> <Node id="300804" />Then
Chloe saw them stand fixed, on the steps of a throne, six on the one
side, six on the other; and the throne itself was above and behind them,
carved as it were out of sapphire, very deep and clear; and on the
throne a king sat, with a crown on his head.<Node id="301062" /> <Node id="301063" />In the crown was the Stone,
and it shone with a soft whiteness, and in it, amid the gold, in a deep
blackness the letters of the Name were moving and glowing.<Node id="301221" /> <Node id="301222" />Below the
throne Chloe saw the companies assembled, the companies of the doctors
of the Law and of the ambassadors from many lands, and the awful Djinn
and Angels, diabolic or divine, who waited on the word of Suleiman ben
Daood, king in Jerusalem.<Node id="301470" /> <Node id="301471" />Then she looked again at the king, and saw
that his right hand lay closed upon his vestmented knees, but while she
looked he lifted it slowly up, the whole assemblage bowing themselves to
the ground, and opened it.<Node id="301685" /> <Node id="301686" />But what was in or on it Chloe did not see,
for there leapt upon her from it a blinding light, and at once her whole
being felt a sudden devastating pain and then a sense of satisfaction
entire and exquisite, as if desires beyond her knowledge had been
evoked and contented at once, a perfect apprehension, a longing and
a fulfilment.<Node id="302020" /> <Node id="302021" />So intense was the stress that she shrieked aloud;
immediately it was gone, and she found herself standing upright by the
side of the bed, trembling, open-mouthed, holding agonizedly to its
framework.<Node id="302221" />

<Node id="302223" />She sank onto it and remained exhausted.<Node id="302263" /> <Node id="302264" />Only it seemed in a little
that the noise of the lions was still in her ears and a voice with it.<Node id="302361" />
<Node id="302362" />Gradually she found the voice was saying: 'Miss Burnett!<Node id="302418" /> <Node id="302419" />Miss Burnett!<Node id="302432" />
<Node id="302433" />Are you all right, Miss Burnett?<Node id="302465" />' <Node id="302467" />and knew it for the landlady's.<Node id="302498" />

<Node id="302500" />'<Node id="302501" />Yes, Mrs. Webb, yes, all right, thank you,' Chloe stammered.<Node id="302561" /> '<Node id="302563" />It was
just--it was--it was something in my sleep.<Node id="302613" /> <Node id="302614" />I'm so sor--I mean, I
was--please, it's quite, quite all right.<Node id="302677" />'<Node id="302678" />

<Node id="302680" />'<Node id="302681" />Are you sure?<Node id="302694" />' <Node id="302696" />Mrs. Webb said, still doubtfully.<Node id="302729" /> '<Node id="302731" />I thought you were
being killed.<Node id="302763" />'<Node id="302764" />

<Node id="302766" />'<Node id="302767" />Thank you so _very_ much,' Chloe said again, and then in a sudden rush
of heroic virtue got to her feet, struggled across the room, unlocked
the door, and spoke comfortingly to the anxious Mrs. Webb till the old
lady at last went away.<Node id="303002" /> <Node id="303003" />Chloe shut the door, with a desolating sense
that she had forgotten everything, went back to bed, and as she
stretched herself down into it went off immediately into a profound
sleep.<Node id="303186" />

<Node id="303188" />So profound and effective was it that she was rather more than half an
hour late the next morning in arriving at Lancaster Gate, where she
found Lord Arglay in a high state of excitement.<Node id="303375" /> '<Node id="303377" />Don't apologize,' he
said, 'but I thought you were never coming.<Node id="303441" /> <Node id="303442" />Nothing wrong?<Node id="303456" /> <Node id="303457" />No, all
right, that's merely my rubbing it in.<Node id="303503" /> <Node id="303504" />Look at this and all will be
forgiven.<Node id="303542" />' <Node id="303544" />He held out to her the morning paper, directing her eyes to a
remote paragraph.<Node id="303623" /> '<Node id="303625" />Strange Incident at Birmingham,' she read.<Node id="303667" /> '<Node id="303669" />Missing
Man Burgles Laboratory.<Node id="303700" />'<Node id="303701" />

<Node id="303703" />'<Node id="303704" />The laboratory assistant Elijah Pondon who was supposed to have lost
his memory at Birmingham was discovered this morning in curious
circumstances.<Node id="303851" /> <Node id="303852" />When the senior demonstrator visited the laboratory
late last night during Professor Palliser's absence in London, whose
assistant the missing man was, he found Pondon already there.<Node id="304034" /> <Node id="304035" />His
entrance is at present inexplicable as he had no key, and the laboratory
had not been in use during yesterday.<Node id="304149" /> <Node id="304150" />Efforts to obtain a statement have
not so far succeeded, as he appears to be in a dazed condition.<Node id="304248" /> <Node id="304249" />It is
supposed he must have some means of entry known only to himself.<Node id="304319" />'<Node id="304320" />

<Node id="304322" />'"<Node id="304324" />Means of entry known only to himself,"' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="304381" /> '"<Node id="304384" />Dazed
condition!<Node id="304400" />" <Node id="304402" />I should think he probably _was_ in a dazed condition.<Node id="304456" /> <Node id="304457" />But
we've done it, child.<Node id="304482" /> <Node id="304483" />We've given him a means of entry known ...<Node id="304525" /> <Node id="304526" />and so
forth.<Node id="304539" />'<Node id="304540" />

<Node id="304542" />'<Node id="304543" />We?<Node id="304546" />' <Node id="304548" />Chloe said.<Node id="304559" />

<Node id="304561" />'<Node id="304562" />We,' Lord Arglay said firmly.<Node id="304591" /> '<Node id="304593" />By virtue of the Stone, if you like, but
after all it was we who determined and tried--determined, dared, and
done.<Node id="304708" /> <Node id="304709" />Heavens, how pleased I am!<Node id="304735" />' <Node id="304737" />His mood changed and he began to walk
up and down the room.<Node id="304796" /> '<Node id="304798" />I wonder what Pondon makes of it,' he said.<Node id="304841" /> '<Node id="304843" />Does
he know anything?<Node id="304865" /> <Node id="304866" />does he guess anything?<Node id="304889" /> <Node id="304890" />What did he see, feel, or do?<Node id="304919" />
<Node id="304920" />or didn't he do, feel, or see anything?<Node id="304959" /> <Node id="304960" />Has he just linked up with
Friday night?<Node id="305000" /> <Node id="305001" />or does his memory...<Node id="305022" />' <Node id="305024" />His voice died as he meditated.<Node id="305055" />

<Node id="305057" />Chloe fingered the paper.<Node id="305082" /> '<Node id="305084" />Do you think we ought to know?<Node id="305114" />' <Node id="305116" />she asked.<Node id="305126" />

<Node id="305128" />'<Node id="305129" />I don't know about "ought,"' Lord Arglay answered, 'but I should very
much like to know.<Node id="305217" /> <Node id="305218" />Why?<Node id="305222" />'<Node id="305223" />

<Node id="305225" />'<Node id="305226" />I was wondering,' Chloe said.<Node id="305255" /> '<Node id="305257" />I could go to Birmingham if you liked
and talk to him a little.<Node id="305320" />'<Node id="305321" />

<Node id="305323" />'<Node id="305324" />Things are getting so frightfully complicated,' the Chief Justice
sighed.<Node id="305397" /> '<Node id="305399" />There's the Government and Sheldrake and Giles and the Persians
and the Mayor--all busy about it.<Node id="305496" />' <Node id="305498" />Chloe mentally added Frank Lindsay to
the list, and might (had she known in what confidences Mr. Lindsay's
irritation had resulted) have added also the Secretary of the National
Transport Union.<Node id="305692" /> <Node id="305693" />But she said nothing.<Node id="305714" />

<Node id="305716" />'<Node id="305717" />I don't really like letting you out of my sight,' Arglay went on.<Node id="305782" /> '<Node id="305784" />Yet
it _might_ be useful to know what this Pondon knows--if anything,' he
added dubiously.<Node id="305874" /> '<Node id="305876" />Is there anyone who could go with you?<Node id="305914" /> <Node id="305915" />What about your
friend Mr. Lindsay?<Node id="305950" />'<Node id="305951" />

<Node id="305953" />'<Node id="305954" />No, O no,' Chloe said, stopped, and went on.<Node id="305998" /> '<Node id="306000" />But what do you think
could possibly happen, Lord Arglay?<Node id="306057" /> <Node id="306058" />They haven't any reason to do
anything to _me_.<Node id="306105" />'<Node id="306106" />

<Node id="306108" />'<Node id="306109" />I told you last night,' the Chief Justice answered, 'that they're bound
to want to get all the Types into their possession--Sheldrake and the
Government anyhow, and I suppose the Persians, only they don't stand a
chance.<Node id="306329" /> <Node id="306330" />And now there'll be the Mayor too; I don't believe he realizes
yet that I have one.<Node id="306413" />'<Node id="306414" />

<Node id="306416" />'<Node id="306417" />You didn't tell him?<Node id="306437" />' <Node id="306439" />Chloe asked.<Node id="306451" />

<Node id="306453" />'<Node id="306454" />No,' Arglay answered.<Node id="306475" /> '<Node id="306477" />I'm becoming very shy of telling anyone anything
about the Stone.<Node id="306542" /> <Node id="306543" />But he's bound to hear, and then he'll be at me to go
down to Rich on a mission of healing.<Node id="306634" /> <Node id="306635" />Well, I won't.<Node id="306649" />'<Node id="306650" />

<Node id="306652" />This possibility was a new idea to Chloe and for a few moments she gazed
at Lord Arglay in silence.<Node id="306751" />

<Node id="306753" />'<Node id="306754" />You won't?<Node id="306764" />' <Node id="306766" />she asked at last, consideringly.<Node id="306799" />

<Node id="306801" />'<Node id="306802" />I withdraw "won't,"' he answered, 'because I don't really know from
moment to moment what I shall be doing.<Node id="306909" /> <Node id="306910" />I may.<Node id="306916" /> <Node id="306917" />I may find myself sitting
in the market place or the Old Moot Hall or whatever they have there,
handing the Stone to one after another, and watching the sick take up
their beds and walk.<Node id="307103" /> <Node id="307104" />Or at least get off them.<Node id="307129" /> <Node id="307130" />O don't, don't let's go
into that now.<Node id="307168" /> <Node id="307169" />Would you like to go to Birmingham?<Node id="307204" />'<Node id="307205" />

<Node id="307207" />'<Node id="307208" />I think I should rather,' Chloe said.<Node id="307245" /> '<Node id="307247" />I should like to see the man you
saved.<Node id="307286" /> <Node id="307287" />And whether he feels anything about it.<Node id="307326" />'<Node id="307327" />

<Node id="307329" />Lord Arglay went to the telephone.<Node id="307363" /> <Node id="307364" />With his hand on the receiver he
paused.<Node id="307404" /> '<Node id="307406" />Do you remember Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="307436" />' <Node id="307438" />he asked.<Node id="307447" />

<Node id="307449" />'<Node id="307450" />Yes, of course,' Chloe said.<Node id="307478" /> '<Node id="307480" />Why?<Node id="307484" />'<Node id="307485" />

<Node id="307487" />'<Node id="307488" />Did you like Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="307515" />' <Node id="307517" />Lord Arglay went on.<Node id="307537" />

<Node id="307539" />'<Node id="307540" />He seemed quite nice and intelligent, I thought,' Chloe answered.<Node id="307605" /> '<Node id="307607" />I
didn't trouble about him much.<Node id="307639" />'<Node id="307640" />

<Node id="307642" />'<Node id="307643" />Would you mind him coming to Birmingham with you?<Node id="307692" />' <Node id="307694" />Arglay said.<Node id="307706" />

<Node id="307708" />'<Node id="307709" />It seems quite unnecessary,' Chloe objected.<Node id="307753" /> '<Node id="307755" />But no--not if you would
like him to.<Node id="307792" /> <Node id="307793" />It's nice of you to worry--' she added suddenly.<Node id="307841" />

<Node id="307843" />The Chief Justice, engaged in ringing up the hotel where the Mayor and
Oliver had found a night's shelter, waved a hand, and then, while
waiting for Oliver to be found, said: 'After all, when this is over--I
suppose it will be, some time--there is _Organic Law_.<Node id="308105" /> <Node id="308106" />If you like.<Node id="308118" /> <Node id="308119" />Not
that you really care for Organic Law, do you, child?<Node id="308175" />'<Node id="308176" />

<Node id="308178" />She answered his smile with another, flushing a little, then she said:
'I do see something of it, I think.<Node id="308284" /> <Node id="308285" />But it seems so far away from...<Node id="308317" />'<Node id="308318" />

<Node id="308320" />'<Node id="308321" />People,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="308347" /> '<Node id="308349" />And yet so is the Stone.<Node id="308373" /> <Node id="308374" />Or it looks like
it.<Node id="308394" /> <Node id="308395" />On our last night's hypothesis--Is that Mr. Doncaster?<Node id="308449" /> <Node id="308450" />This is Lord
Arglay.<Node id="308470" /> <Node id="308471" />Mr. Doncaster, are you doing anything urgent to-day, either for
yourself or for Don Quixote?<Node id="308563" />... <Node id="308567" />I was wondering whether you could and
would take Miss Burnett to Birmingham....<Node id="308646" /> <Node id="308647" />O the same story....<Node id="308667" /> <Node id="308668" />Yes,
she'll tell you all about it in the train....<Node id="308718" /> <Node id="308719" />Do.<Node id="308722" /> <Node id="308723" />Good-bye.<Node id="308732" />--<Node id="308734" />So that's
settled.<Node id="308752" />'<Node id="308753" />

<Node id="308755" />'<Node id="308756" />I don't know what use he's going to be,' Chloe said.<Node id="308808" />

<Node id="308810" />'<Node id="308811" />O--lunch,' said Lord Arglay, 'and tickets ...<Node id="308856" /> <Node id="308857" />have you any money, by
the way?<Node id="308888" /> <Node id="308889" />I'll get you some ...<Node id="308910" /> <Node id="308911" />and to keep an eye on your back in case a
Persian attacks you with a yataghan or what not.<Node id="309001" />'<Node id="309002" />

<Node id="309004" />'<Node id="309005" />And what use am I going to be?<Node id="309035" />' <Node id="309037" />Chloe asked.<Node id="309049" />

<Node id="309051" />'<Node id="309052" />You will be of one chief use,' Arglay answered.<Node id="309099" /> '<Node id="309101" />You will discover all
that is possible of the nature of the Stone.<Node id="309167" />' <Node id="309169" />He put his arm over her
shoulders and she reached up her hand and took his.<Node id="309244" /> '<Node id="309246" />It may be,' he went
on, 'that before these things are ended we shall have great need of
knowing ...<Node id="309345" /> <Node id="309346" />and perhaps of trusting ...<Node id="309373" /> <Node id="309374" />the Stone.<Node id="309384" />'<Node id="309385" />




<Node id="309390" />CHAPTER XII<Node id="309401" />

<Node id="309403" />NATIONAL TRANSPORT<Node id="309421" />


<Node id="309424" />The General Secretary of the National Transport Union listened to his
subordinate the next morning with considerable incredulity.<Node id="309553" /> <Node id="309554" />It was, in
fact, only the caution necessary to his official position that prevented
him being openly contemptuous, and even that caution was strained.<Node id="309704" />

<Node id="309706" />'<Node id="309707" />Do you expect me to believe that a man can fly through walls and
ceilings?<Node id="309781" />' <Node id="309783" />he asked.<Node id="309792" />

<Node id="309794" />'<Node id="309795" />No, sir,' Carnegie said deferentially.<Node id="309833" /> '<Node id="309835" />I don't expect you to believe
anything--I don't know that I do.<Node id="309898" /> <Node id="309899" />But I thought you'd like to know what
was being said.<Node id="309952" />'<Node id="309953" />

<Node id="309955" />'<Node id="309956" />But who's saying it--except some friend of yours?<Node id="310005" />' <Node id="310007" />the General
Secretary asked.<Node id="310035" /> '<Node id="310037" />I mean--it's not evidence, is it?<Node id="310070" />'<Node id="310071" />

<Node id="310073" />'<Node id="310074" />My friend mentioned Lord Arglay, sir,' Carnegie ventured.<Node id="310131" /> '<Node id="310133" />That's
really what made me decide to tell you.<Node id="310179" />'<Node id="310180" />

<Node id="310182" />'<Node id="310183" />What!<Node id="310188" />' <Node id="310190" />the General Secretary said, 'I'd forgotten that bit.<Node id="310242" /> <Node id="310243" />D'you mean
the Chief Justice?<Node id="310272" />'<Node id="310273" />

<Node id="310275" />'<Node id="310276" />Yes, sir.<Node id="310285" /> <Node id="310286" />This girl is his secretary.<Node id="310313" />'<Node id="310314" />

<Node id="310316" />Mr.<Node id="310319" /> <Node id="310320" />Theophilus Merridew got up and went across to the fireplace, at
which he stood staring.<Node id="310407" />

<Node id="310409" />'<Node id="310410" />It's obviously got twisted round somehow,' he said at last irritably.<Node id="310479" />
'<Node id="310481" />But what on earth could get twisted into such a fantastic tale?<Node id="310544" /> <Node id="310545" />I think
I'd better see your friend, Carnegie.<Node id="310590" />'<Node id="310591" />

<Node id="310593" />'<Node id="310594" />Yes, sir,' Carnegie said.<Node id="310619" /> '<Node id="310621" />You won't forget that he may not really have
meant to tell me so much?<Node id="310691" />'<Node id="310692" />

<Node id="310694" />'<Node id="310695" />I shouldn't think he did,' the General Secretary answered.<Node id="310753" /> '<Node id="310755" />If I
hadn't always found you a very reliable fellow--and if it wasn't for
Lord Arglay--I met him once on a Commission and he seemed a very
level-headed sort of man.<Node id="310919" /> <Node id="310920" />But this....<Node id="310932" /> <Node id="310933" />No, I won't.<Node id="310945" /> <Node id="310946" />The whole thing's
too ridiculous....<Node id="310982" /> <Node id="310983" />But what the devil can it be they've got hold of?<Node id="311032" />
<Node id="311033" />Tell me all about it again.<Node id="311060" />'<Node id="311061" />

<Node id="311063" />Carnegie did so, stressing his own unbelief and his anxiety merely to
bring it to his chief's notice as part of his official duty, however
wild the rumour might be, in anything that had to do with transport.<Node id="311270" />

<Node id="311272" />'<Node id="311273" />Can't we get hold of a bit of this precious Stone?<Node id="311323" />' <Node id="311325" />Merridew asked at
the end.<Node id="311351" /> '<Node id="311353" />Who's got it?<Node id="311366" />'<Node id="311367" />

<Node id="311369" />'<Node id="311370" />Well, sir, the girl's got a bit--because Lindsay wanted it, and I
understood Lord Arglay had, and of course the Government because of this
affair at Rich.<Node id="311524" /> <Node id="311525" />I don't know who else.<Node id="311547" /> <Node id="311548" />O!<Node id="311550" /> <Node id="311551" />Sheldrake.<Node id="311561" />'<Node id="311562" />

<Node id="311564" />'<Node id="311565" />What!<Node id="311570" />' <Node id="311572" />said Merridew.<Node id="311586" /> '<Node id="311588" />What, the Atlantic Airways man?<Node id="311619" /> <Node id="311620" />Why didn't you
say so before?<Node id="311649" /> <Node id="311650" />I know Sheldrake well enough--I'll go and see _him_.<Node id="311702" />
<Node id="311703" />Whatever bit of truth there is behind this he'll have got hold of.<Node id="311769" /> <Node id="311770" />And
if the bit of truth is anything we ought to know about--he won't want an
upset any more than we do.<Node id="311873" />'<Node id="311874" />

<Node id="311876" />'<Node id="311877" />I thought he was on the other side, sir,' Carnegie said smiling.<Node id="311941" />

<Node id="311943" />'<Node id="311944" />Profits mean employment, employment means profits,' said Mr. Merridew.<Node id="312014" />
'<Node id="312016" />Didn't we agree on that at the last Conciliation Conference?<Node id="312076" /> <Node id="312077" />Very well
then.<Node id="312092" /> <Node id="312093" />I'll see if I can get him at once.<Node id="312127" />'<Node id="312128" />

<Node id="312130" />It happened therefore a little later that morning that Sheldrake was
asked if he could see Mr. Merridew, who for one reason or another was a
fairly frequent caller and was admitted.<Node id="312311" />

<Node id="312313" />'<Node id="312314" />I've come on a funny business,' he said cheerfully, sitting down.<Node id="312379" /> '<Node id="312381" />I
want to know anything you can tell me about this Stone of yours.<Node id="312447" />'<Node id="312448" />

<Node id="312450" />'<Node id="312451" />Eh?<Node id="312454" />' <Node id="312456" />said Sheldrake, really surprised, for he could imagine no reason
why Merridew should take an interest in a medicinal stone.<Node id="312579" /> <Node id="312580" />And there had
been nothing else in the papers.<Node id="312626" /> '<Node id="312628" />The Stone?<Node id="312638" /> <Node id="312639" />Why do you want to know
about the Stone?<Node id="312679" />'<Node id="312680" />

<Node id="312682" />The General Secretary, equally in fear of ridicule and negligence, went
carefully.<Node id="312764" />

<Node id="312766" />'<Node id="312767" />I want to know what truth there is in this rumour that Lord Arglay's
putting about,' he said, 'that it's going to do something queer to
transport.<Node id="312913" />'<Node id="312914" />

<Node id="312916" />'<Node id="312917" />Transport?<Node id="312927" />' <Node id="312929" />Sheldrake asked with a pretence of renewed surprise.<Node id="312981" /> '<Node id="312983" />Does
Lord Arglay say that?<Node id="313009" />'<Node id="313010" />

<Node id="313012" />'<Node id="313013" />No, no,' Mr. Merridew said.<Node id="313040" /> '<Node id="313042" />You don't catch me committing myself to
that, not with a lawyer.<Node id="313106" /> <Node id="313107" />I don't mind letting his name drop in, so to
speak, between you and me, but actually perhaps I'd better say--what
truth there is in this rumour that's got about?<Node id="313268" /> <Node id="313269" />I needn't tell you that,
whatever it is, we don't want transport reduced any more than you do.<Node id="313363" />'<Node id="313364" />

<Node id="313366" />Sheldrake thought for a minute or two.<Node id="313404" /> <Node id="313405" />On the one hand he wasn't
anxious to bring anyone into the secret; on the other, to have the Union
at his back would bring extra pressure to bear on the Government, of
whose intentions he still remained doubtful.<Node id="313617" /> <Node id="313618" />It had been desirable that
he should recover his own Stone, but it was absolutely necessary that he
should stop any ideas--still more any copies--of it from getting about.<Node id="313789" />
<Node id="313790" />That would be, if not ruin, at least very considerable inconvenience.<Node id="313859" />
<Node id="313860" />And it would mean very considerable inconvenience to Mr. Merridew's
clients also, of that he was sure.<Node id="313962" /> <Node id="313963" />Weighing all this in his mind, and
throwing into the balance Mr. Merridew's own reputed and experienced
discretion, he decided to speak.<Node id="314099" /> <Node id="314100" />He gave, without names, a summary of
how it had reached him, of the concern felt in high quarters, of its
powers medicinal and expeditory.<Node id="314238" /> <Node id="314239" />And finally he drew from his inner
waistcoat pocket the absurd Thing itself, and, very carefully holding
it, displayed it to Mr. Merridew, who sat staring at it.<Node id="314400" />

<Node id="314402" />'<Node id="314403" />Well,' he said at last, 'that's not going to damage transport, is it?<Node id="314472" />
<Node id="314473" />It looks like nothing on earth.<Node id="314504" /> <Node id="314505" />What's it supposed to _do_?<Node id="314532" /> <Node id="314533" />What ...<Node id="314541" />
<Node id="314542" />what is it?<Node id="314553" />' <Node id="314555" />he ended helplessly.<Node id="314575" />

<Node id="314577" />Sheldrake shook his head.<Node id="314602" /> '<Node id="314604" />Tumulty says something about it being an
original.<Node id="314654" />'<Node id="314655" />

<Node id="314657" />'<Node id="314658" />Original enough,' Mr. Merridew murmured, still staring.<Node id="314713" />

<Node id="314715" />'<Node id="314716" />And Lord Arglay told my wife it was the centre of the derivations,'
Sheldrake added.<Node id="314800" />

<Node id="314802" />'<Node id="314803" />Centre of what derivations?<Node id="314830" />' <Node id="314832" />Merridew asked, more bewildered than ever.<Node id="314874" />
'<Node id="314876" />Look here, Sheldrake, can't you show me what it'll do?<Node id="314930" /> <Node id="314931" />What _happens_
when you ...<Node id="314958" /> <Node id="314959" />use it, if that's the word?<Node id="314986" />'<Node id="314987" />

<Node id="314989" />Sheldrake being not unwilling to convince him, Mr. Merridew emerged
from the next few minutes in a startled and very anxious condition.<Node id="315124" /> <Node id="315125" />It
seemed clear indeed that transport was going to be in a serious state
of collapse if the Stone was multiplied.<Node id="315238" /> <Node id="315239" />On the other hand he very
naturally and very badly wanted it.<Node id="315300" /> '<Node id="315302" />But what's this girl doing with
it?<Node id="315337" />' <Node id="315339" />he asked.<Node id="315348" /> '<Node id="315350" />Carnegie told me that his friend said she was Arglay's
secretary and she had one.<Node id="315431" />'<Node id="315432" />

<Node id="315434" />'<Node id="315435" />I know, I know,' Sheldrake said.<Node id="315467" /> '<Node id="315469" />Arglay and she have them, and I wish
they hadn't.<Node id="315518" /> <Node id="315519" />But I can't get Birlesmere to do anything drastic; this
Chief Justice is too important to be ...<Node id="315615" /> <Node id="315616" />just dealt with, so he says.<Node id="315644" /> <Node id="315645" />I
don't suppose he'll do anything with it, but I wish to God we had them
all under lock and key.<Node id="315741" /> <Node id="315742" />It's not safe while they're about in the world.<Node id="315789" />'<Node id="315790" />

<Node id="315792" />Merridew got up meditatively.<Node id="315821" /> '<Node id="315823" />Well, anyhow,' he said, 'we run together
in this.<Node id="315872" /> <Node id="315873" />You'll let me know of any developments?<Node id="315912" />'<Node id="315913" />

<Node id="315915" />'<Node id="315916" />I will,' Sheldrake answered.<Node id="315944" /> '<Node id="315946" />And keep it quiet.<Node id="315964" /> <Node id="315965" />You won't want your
conferences to get nervy.<Node id="316010" /> <Node id="316011" />Tell me if you manage to get hold of
Arglay's.<Node id="316057" />'<Node id="316058" />

<Node id="316060" />'<Node id="316061" />I don't know about Arglay's,' Merridew said, 'but I wonder whether....<Node id="316131" />
<Node id="316132" />All right.<Node id="316142" /> <Node id="316143" />Good-bye for now.<Node id="316160" />'<Node id="316161" />

<Node id="316163" />He returned to his office still in profound meditation and when he had
reached it sent for Carnegie.<Node id="316263" />

<Node id="316265" />'<Node id="316266" />This friend of yours,' he began, 'the fellow who told you about the
Stone--I've seen Sheldrake, and I'm bound to say it seems a serious
business--you keep your mouth shut, Carnegie, and stand by me, and I'll
look after you ...<Node id="316492" /> <Node id="316493" />understand?<Node id="316504" /> <Node id="316505" />Very well.<Node id="316515" /> <Node id="316516" />As I was saying, this friend
of yours--who is he?<Node id="316565" />'<Node id="316566" />

<Node id="316568" />Carnegie explained Frank Lindsay.<Node id="316601" />

<Node id="316603" />'<Node id="316604" />Well off?<Node id="316613" />' <Node id="316615" />asked Mr. Merridew.<Node id="316634" /> '<Node id="316636" />No, of course not.<Node id="316654" /> <Node id="316655" />And he was a bit up
in the air over it, was he?<Node id="316702" /> <Node id="316703" />Is he a ...<Node id="316714" /> <Node id="316715" />sensible fellow?<Node id="316731" /> <Node id="316732" />the kind that
can see where his own interests lie?<Node id="316782" />'<Node id="316783" />

<Node id="316785" />'<Node id="316786" />I think so, sir,' Carnegie said.<Node id="316818" /> '<Node id="316820" />He always seemed to me a pretty
level-headed chap.<Node id="316870" /> <Node id="316871" />Reads a good deal, but I suppose he has to do that.<Node id="316922" />'<Node id="316923" />

<Node id="316925" />'<Node id="316926" />Yes ...<Node id="316933" /> <Node id="316934" />umph ...<Node id="316942" /> <Node id="316943" />well,' said the other.<Node id="316965" /> '<Node id="316967" />Get him round here, will you,
Carnegie?<Node id="317006" /> <Node id="317007" />Ask him to look in here at lunch time; ask him to lunch--no,
better not; that would look too eager.<Node id="317106" /> <Node id="317107" />Ask him to look in and see me.<Node id="317137" />
<Node id="317138" />You needn't let him know what you've told me.<Node id="317183" /> <Node id="317184" />Just that I was speaking
of the Stone and you mentioned you knew someone who knew this Miss
Burnett who is the Chief Justice's secretary.<Node id="317321" /> <Node id="317322" />See?<Node id="317326" />'<Node id="317327" />

<Node id="317329" />Carnegie saw at any rate sufficiently well to lure Frank round to the
offices of the Union, and there introduced him to Mr. Merridew, who was
extremely interested and affable.<Node id="317504" />

<Node id="317506" />'<Node id="317507" />Ah, Mr. Lindsay, how kind of you!<Node id="317540" /> <Node id="317541" />Do sit down.<Node id="317553" /> <Node id="317554" />Don't go, Carnegie,
don't go.<Node id="317583" /> <Node id="317584" />It's a shame to trouble you about this, Mr. Lindsay, but if
you can help us I needn't say how grateful I should be.<Node id="317699" /> <Node id="317700" />Of course I
quite understand that this is all confidential.<Node id="317759" /> <Node id="317760" />Now I'm in a state of
great anxiety, very great anxiety indeed, and when Carnegie let out that
he knew you and that you were in touch with the Lord Chief Justice and
so on, I thought a little chat couldn't at any rate do any harm.<Node id="317990" /> <Node id="317991" />It's
all about this Stone of yours.<Node id="318026" />'<Node id="318027" />

<Node id="318029" />'<Node id="318030" />Not of mine, I'm afraid,' Frank said.<Node id="318067" /> <Node id="318068" />His first feeling on waking that
morning had been that he had been rather hard on Chloe, but as he
dressed and became more clearly aware that the examination was one
morning nearer this had given way to the feeling that Chloe had been
very hard on him.<Node id="318320" /> <Node id="318321" />In which opinion he still remained.<Node id="318356" /> '<Node id="318358" />I've not even
seen it properly.<Node id="318389" />'<Node id="318390" />

<Node id="318392" />'<Node id="318393" />It's Miss Burnett who has it?<Node id="318422" />' <Node id="318424" />Mr. Merridew asked half-casually.<Node id="318457" />

<Node id="318459" />'<Node id="318460" />It is,' said Frank.<Node id="318479" /> '<Node id="318481" />And of course Lord Arglay.<Node id="318507" />'<Node id="318508" />

<Node id="318510" />'<Node id="318511" />Ah, yes, Lord Arglay,' Merridew assented.<Node id="318552" /> '<Node id="318554" />Lord Arglay--have you ever
met him?<Node id="318589" />'<Node id="318590" />

<Node id="318592" />'<Node id="318593" />Once,' Frank said.<Node id="318611" />

<Node id="318613" />'<Node id="318614" />Lord Arglay is a delightful man in himself, I believe,' Merridew went
on, 'but I'm not sure that he isn't in some ways a little narrow-minded.<Node id="318756" />
<Node id="318757" />A lawyer is almost bound to be perhaps.<Node id="318796" /> <Node id="318797" />However, that's neither here nor
there.<Node id="318836" /> <Node id="318837" />My own trouble is quite simple.<Node id="318868" /> <Node id="318869" />I'm responsible, as far as any
man is, for all the members of this Union getting shelter and food from
their jobs.<Node id="318983" /> <Node id="318984" />Now, I've not seen this Stone, and I can hardly believe
what's said, but it's said--it is _said_--that it means there's some new
method of movement.<Node id="319132" /> <Node id="319133" />I suppose it's a kind of scientific invention.<Node id="319179" />'<Node id="319180" />

<Node id="319182" />'<Node id="319183" />I really don't know,' Frank said, as Mr. Merridew paused.<Node id="319240" /> '<Node id="319242" />I only know
what Miss Burnett told me.<Node id="319280" /> <Node id="319281" />O and Mrs. Sheldrake seemed very anxious
about it.<Node id="319331" />'<Node id="319332" />

<Node id="319334" />'<Node id="319335" />Ah, the ladies, the ladies!<Node id="319362" />' <Node id="319364" />the General Secretary smiled.<Node id="319393" /> '<Node id="319395" />A little
credulous, perhaps--yes?<Node id="319428" /> <Node id="319429" />But I do feel that, if there should be anything
in it, I ought to know _what_.<Node id="319507" /> <Node id="319508" />And as between a lady, a lawyer, and, if
I may say so, a man of the world like yourself, I naturally preferred
to get into touch with you.<Node id="319646" /> <Node id="319647" />After all--I don't know what your political
views may be, but after all someone ought to think of these millions of
hardworking men whose livelihood is in danger.<Node id="319809" />'<Node id="319810" />

<Node id="319812" />'<Node id="319813" />But I don't see quite what _I_ can do,' Frank said.<Node id="319864" /> '<Node id="319866" />Miss Burnett
wouldn't lend me the Stone.<Node id="319906" />'<Node id="319907" />

<Node id="319909" />'<Node id="319910" />She wouldn't, you think,' Merridew asked, casually looking down at his
papers, 'sell it?<Node id="319998" />'<Node id="319999" />

<Node id="320001" />'<Node id="320002" />Eh?<Node id="320005" /> <Node id="320006" />sell it?<Node id="320014" />' <Node id="320016" />Frank exclaimed.<Node id="320032" /> '<Node id="320034" />No, I don't--I'm almost sure she
wouldn't.<Node id="320076" /> <Node id="320077" />Besides Mrs. Sheldrake said something about seventy thousand
pounds.<Node id="320145" />'<Node id="320146" />

<Node id="320148" />'<Node id="320149" />Ah, well, a poor Trades Union could hardly go to that--but then I'd be
quite willing only to borrow it,' Merridew said.<Node id="320268" /> '<Node id="320270" />If for instance you
by any chance had one of them--I'd willingly pay a good sum for the
privilege of borrowing it for a little while.<Node id="320403" /> <Node id="320404" />Say----' he estimated
Frank for a moment and ended--'a few hundreds even.<Node id="320477" /> <Node id="320478" />It's of such _dire_
importance to my people.<Node id="320522" />'<Node id="320523" />

<Node id="320525" />Frank considered, and the more he considered the more certain he became
that to offer Chloe, if she were still in her last night's mood, a few
hundreds would be the same as offering her a few millions or a few
pence.<Node id="320741" /> <Node id="320742" />In these silly tempers it would mean nothing to her.<Node id="320794" />

<Node id="320796" />'<Node id="320797" />I can ask her, of course,' he said reluctantly.<Node id="320844" />

<Node id="320846" />'<Node id="320847" />If she should lend it to you for any reason----' Mr. Merridew
thoughtfully said.<Node id="320927" /> '<Node id="320929" />If, I mean, you had any need of it and--as she
naturally would--she passed it on to you, perhaps you'd bear me in
mind.<Node id="321048" />'<Node id="321049" />

<Node id="321051" />'<Node id="321052" />I don't think she's likely to do that,' Frank said.<Node id="321103" />

<Node id="321105" />'<Node id="321106" />Or even if you could borrow it sometime--I don't mean exactly without
her knowing, though if she didn't happen to want it....<Node id="321231" /> <Node id="321232" />I understand
Lord Arglay has one, and I suppose if Miss Burnett works there she could
always use his--if you happened across it some time....<Node id="321373" /> <Node id="321374" />I don't know
whether Miss Burnett is one of those young ladies who always leave their
umbrellas or their handbags or something behind them----'<Node id="321517" />

<Node id="321519" />'<Node id="321520" />No,' Frank said, 'she isn't.<Node id="321548" />'<Node id="321549" />

<Node id="321551" />'<Node id="321552" />Well, if she did'--Merridew went on--'or, as I say, if you borrowed it
for any purpose of your own--well, if you had it in any way, and would
show it me, I should be very glad to pay a fee.<Node id="321741" /> <Node id="321742" />Better spend a few
hundreds first than a few millions on unemployment pay, you know, is
the way I look at it.<Node id="321851" /> <Node id="321852" />Prevention is better than cure.<Node id="321883" />'<Node id="321884" />

<Node id="321886" />'<Node id="321887" />I see,' Frank answered.<Node id="321910" />

<Node id="321912" />He was not at all clear what he did see, moving in his mind, what kind
of action half-presented itself and then withdrew, but to borrow the
Stone for his examination, just for the day or two, couldn't do any
harm.<Node id="322125" /> <Node id="322126" />And if this fellow was willing to pay ...<Node id="322167" /> <Node id="322168" />Chloe should have it, of
course; she'd only about thirty pounds at her back.<Node id="322244" /> <Node id="322245" />Or at least they
might split it--she was always very good about paying if things were
rather tight, and she'd probably rather ...<Node id="322374" /> <Node id="322375" />only then she'd have to
know.<Node id="322404" /> <Node id="322405" />And if as a matter of fact she hadn't known, if there _were_ any
way of borrowing it, if...<Node id="322496" />

<Node id="322498" />'<Node id="322499" />I see,' he said again, and there was a silence.<Node id="322546" /> <Node id="322547" />Suddenly he stood up.<Node id="322568" />
'<Node id="322570" />Well, I must be going,' he said.<Node id="322602" /> '<Node id="322604" />Yes, I see, Mr. Merridew.<Node id="322629" /> <Node id="322630" />Well, if
anything should happen----'<Node id="322666" />

<Node id="322668" />'<Node id="322669" />Any time, day or night,' the General Secretary said.<Node id="322721" /> '<Node id="322723" />Carnegie will
give you my address.<Node id="322757" /> <Node id="322758" />And of course any expenses--taxis or
anything--good-bye.<Node id="322814" />'<Node id="322815" />

<Node id="322817" />He watched Frank out and when Carnegie returned--'I wish there was a
quicker way,' he said.<Node id="322908" /> '<Node id="322910" />I shall go to the Home Office after lunch, but I
don't suppose they'll let one out of their hands.<Node id="323008" /> <Node id="323009" />I wouldn't if I was
them.<Node id="323034" /> <Node id="323035" />It's up to you to keep on top of your friend, Carnegie.<Node id="323090" /> <Node id="323091" />If he
wants it himself for this examination of his we may just have tipped the
balance.<Node id="323178" /> <Node id="323179" />Though he mayn't be able to do it even so.<Node id="323221" /> <Node id="323222" />Well, we must see.<Node id="323240" />
<Node id="323241" />And now try and make an appointment for me with the Home Office this
afternoon.<Node id="323320" />'<Node id="323321" />

<Node id="323323" />The Home Secretary was a charming politician whose methods differed from
Lord Birlesmere's in that while the Foreign Secretary preferred at least
to appear to direct the storm, Mr. Garterr Browne allowed it to blow
itself out, after which he pointed out to it exactly what damage it
had done.<Node id="323615" /> <Node id="323616" />He got up to shake hands with Mr. Merridew and directed his
attention to another visitor who was standing by the table.<Node id="323735" />

<Node id="323737" />'<Node id="323738" />May I introduce you to Mr. Clerishaw, the Mayor of Rich-by-the-Mere?<Node id="323806" />'
<Node id="323808" />he said.<Node id="323816" /> '<Node id="323818" />Mr.<Node id="323821" /> <Node id="323822" />Merridew, the General Secretary of the National Transport
Union.<Node id="323886" /> <Node id="323887" />Do sit down, both of you.<Node id="323912" /> <Node id="323913" />I fancy this business may be a trifle
long.<Node id="323956" /> <Node id="323957" />Don't be alarmed, Mr. Merridew--I know what you want, at least I
can guess.<Node id="324032" /> <Node id="324033" />My difficulty is ...<Node id="324053" /> <Node id="324054" />but perhaps Mr. Clerishaw had better
explain.<Node id="324099" /> <Node id="324100" />A man always puts his own case best.<Node id="324136" />'<Node id="324137" />

<Node id="324139" />There were those who asserted that this phrase, which was a favourite
with Mr. Garterr Browne, had been responsible for more quarrels in his
party and crises in the Cabinet than any other formula for twenty years.<Node id="324352" />
<Node id="324353" />After hearing it, a man was always convinced that he did, and was
consequently more reluctant to abandon his case than before.<Node id="324479" /> <Node id="324480" />The Mayor
needed no convincing, but neither was he anxious to waste energy.<Node id="324555" />

<Node id="324557" />'<Node id="324558" />I have already stated my case to you, sir, as a member of the
Government,' he said.<Node id="324641" /> '<Node id="324643" />I cannot see that anything is to be gained by
repeating it.<Node id="324702" />'<Node id="324703" />

<Node id="324705" />'<Node id="324706" />I think, Mr. Mayor,' the Home Secretary said, 'that you will find it is
more necessary to convince Mr. Merridew than to persuade me.<Node id="324838" />'<Node id="324839" />

<Node id="324841" />'<Node id="324842" />How so?<Node id="324849" />' <Node id="324851" />the Mayor asked.<Node id="324867" />

<Node id="324869" />'<Node id="324870" />Because Mr. Merridew is one of my difficulties, I fancy,' the Minister
answered.<Node id="324950" /> '<Node id="324952" />Mr.<Node id="324955" /> <Node id="324956" />Secretary, tell me how much publicity do you desire for
the tale of this absurd Stone?<Node id="325042" />'<Node id="325043" />

<Node id="325045" />'<Node id="325046" />What!<Node id="325051" />' <Node id="325053" />Merridew exclaimed--'publicity?<Node id="325084" /> <Node id="325085" />I don't want any publicity at
all--that's the point.<Node id="325137" /> <Node id="325138" />I want to know whether the Government are taking
steps to control all of these precious Stones that are in existence ...<Node id="325258" />
<Node id="325259" />I mean, if there's anything in them.<Node id="325295" /> <Node id="325296" />Or to have immediate assurances
that there is nothing.<Node id="325350" />'<Node id="325351" />

<Node id="325353" />'<Node id="325354" />Yes, but Mr. Clerishaw wants a great deal of publicity,' Mr. Garterr
Browne smiled.<Node id="325437" /> '<Node id="325439" />O a very great deal.<Node id="325459" /> <Node id="325460" />He objects to any kind of secrecy.<Node id="325494" />'<Node id="325495" />

<Node id="325497" />Mr.<Node id="325500" /> <Node id="325501" />Merridew settled himself firmly in his chair.<Node id="325546" /> '<Node id="325548" />And why?<Node id="325556" />' <Node id="325558" />he asked,
very much as a General Secretary should.<Node id="325608" />

<Node id="325610" />The Mayor turned on him.<Node id="325634" /> '<Node id="325636" />Great God, sir,' he said almost fiercely, 'do
you want to condemn thousands of men and women to suffering?<Node id="325742" />'<Node id="325743" />

<Node id="325745" />'<Node id="325746" />I don't,' Merridew said, 'and because I don't I want the Stone
withdrawn from ...<Node id="325827" /> <Node id="325828" />from circulation.<Node id="325845" />'<Node id="325846" />

<Node id="325848" />'<Node id="325849" />Don't you know,' the Mayor cried out, 'that there are those well and
happy to-day who have been in pain and grief for years--all by the
healing powers of this Stone?<Node id="326014" />'<Node id="326015" />

<Node id="326017" />'<Node id="326018" />O you mean the people at Rich?<Node id="326048" />' <Node id="326050" />Merridew exclaimed.<Node id="326069" /> <Node id="326070" />He had entirely
forgotten, in his concern with transport, the virtues of the Stone which
had caused so much disturbance in Rich during the week-end.<Node id="326218" /> <Node id="326219" />But his
phrase sounded as if he relegated the people at Rich to sickness or
health indifferently, and the Mayor took a step forward.<Node id="326351" />

<Node id="326353" />'<Node id="326354" />I speak for the people at Rich,' he said, 'for I am the Mayor of Rich.<Node id="326424" />
<Node id="326425" />By what right do you speak and for whom?<Node id="326465" />'<Node id="326466" />

<Node id="326468" />'<Node id="326469" />I speak,' Merridew answered, sincerely if somewhat habitually moved,
'for the sons of Martha.<Node id="326562" />' <Node id="326564" />He had found Mr. Kipling's poem of the
greatest use in emotional speeches from the platform; that and some of
Mr. Masefield's verses were his favourite perorations.<Node id="326728" /> <Node id="326729" />But the Mayor,
not having read much modern verse, was merely astonished.<Node id="326801" />

<Node id="326803" />'<Node id="326804" />For what?<Node id="326813" />' <Node id="326815" />he asked.<Node id="326824" />

<Node id="326826" />'"<Node id="326828" />For the sailor, the stoker of steamers, the man with the clout,"'
murmured the Home Secretary, who had heard Mr. Merridew before.<Node id="326957" /> '<Node id="326959" />For the
workers--some of them anyhow.<Node id="326996" />'<Node id="326997" />

<Node id="326999" />'<Node id="327000" />And what have the workers to lose because of the Stone?<Node id="327055" />' <Node id="327057" />the Mayor
asked.<Node id="327073" /> '<Node id="327075" />Are not they also the people?<Node id="327104" />'<Node id="327105" />

<Node id="327107" />'<Node id="327108" />Of course they're the people,' the General Secretary exclaimed, 'they
_are_ the people.<Node id="327195" /> <Node id="327196" />And are they to lose their livelihood because of a few
cures?<Node id="327257" />'<Node id="327258" />

<Node id="327260" />'<Node id="327261" />Perhaps,' the Home Secretary put in, 'you haven't realized, Mr. Mayor,
that this very interesting Stone has other qualities, so I am told,
besides the curative.<Node id="327421" /> <Node id="327422" />In short....<Node id="327434" />'<Node id="327435" />

<Node id="327437" />He gave a brief explanation of those qualities.<Node id="327484" /> <Node id="327485" />The Mayor listened
frowning.<Node id="327513" />

<Node id="327515" />'<Node id="327516" />But I confess,' Mr. Garterr Browne ended, 'I didn't know that these
facts--these apparent facts--would have reached Mr. Merridew so soon.<Node id="327653" />
<Node id="327654" />However, as it is----' He got courteously off the storm, and signed to
it to go ahead.<Node id="327740" />

<Node id="327742" />'<Node id="327743" />That,' Merridew said, 'is my case.<Node id="327777" /> <Node id="327778" />If it's some scientific invention,
as I suppose it is, it ought to be State property, and its introduction
into the economic life of the country must only be brought about very,
very gradually.<Node id="327971" />'<Node id="327972" />

<Node id="327974" />'<Node id="327975" />While the poor die in misery,' the Mayor commented.<Node id="328026" />

<Node id="328028" />'<Node id="328029" />Damn it, sir,' Mr. Merridew exclaimed, 'I am speaking for the poor.<Node id="328096" />'<Node id="328097" />

<Node id="328099" />'<Node id="328100" />For the sick and dying?<Node id="328123" />' <Node id="328125" />the Mayor asked.<Node id="328141" /> '<Node id="328143" />For the blind and the
paralytic and the agonized?<Node id="328192" /> <Node id="328193" />Do as you will about economics--but the body
is more than raiment.<Node id="328259" />'<Node id="328260" />

<Node id="328262" />'<Node id="328263" />Not without raiment--not for long,' Mr. Garterr Browne said.<Node id="328323" /> '<Node id="328325" />But go on
with the discussion.<Node id="328355" /> <Node id="328356" />What were you about to say, Mr. Secretary?<Node id="328398" />'<Node id="328399" />

<Node id="328401" />'<Node id="328402" />I protest against the way my words are twisted,' Merridew cried.<Node id="328466" /> '<Node id="328468" />I've
no possible objection to the medicinal use of the Stone.<Node id="328529" />'<Node id="328530" />

<Node id="328532" />'<Node id="328533" />Nor I to its economic suppression,' the Mayor answered and they both
looked at Mr. Garterr Browne.<Node id="328631" />

<Node id="328633" />'<Node id="328634" />Beautiful,' the Minister breathed.<Node id="328668" /> '<Node id="328670" />When democracy lies down with
democracy....<Node id="328713" /> <Node id="328714" />And how, gentlemen, do you propose to use the Stone all
over the country while at the same time keeping it under close guard?<Node id="328839" />'<Node id="328840" />

<Node id="328842" />'<Node id="328843" />The doctors----' Merridew began.<Node id="328875" />

<Node id="328877" />'<Node id="328878" />Hardly,' the Minister said.<Node id="328905" /> '<Node id="328907" />For it must be in the hands and at the
will of those who are to be healed.<Node id="328981" /> <Node id="328982" />And I don't myself see what is to
prevent the ...<Node id="329031" /> <Node id="329032" />the healee from going off by its means, once he is
cured.<Node id="329089" /> <Node id="329090" />We shan't be able to keep it quiet.<Node id="329125" /> <Node id="329126" />And then there will be Stones
everywhere.<Node id="329167" /> <Node id="329168" />I'm not objecting.<Node id="329186" /> <Node id="329187" />I'm only saying that we must use it
either fully or not at all.<Node id="329250" />'<Node id="329251" />

<Node id="329253" />'<Node id="329254" />Then in the name of God, use it!<Node id="329286" />' <Node id="329288" />the Mayor cried out.<Node id="329308" />

<Node id="329310" />'<Node id="329311" />And ruin hundreds and thousands of homes!<Node id="329352" />' <Node id="329354" />Merridew followed him.<Node id="329376" />
'<Node id="329378" />Suppress it, I say.<Node id="329397" />'<Node id="329398" />

<Node id="329400" />Mr.<Node id="329403" /> <Node id="329404" />Garterr Browne waved both hands at the storm.<Node id="329449" /> '<Node id="329451" />You see?<Node id="329459" />' <Node id="329461" />he asked it
courteously, and after a few moments' silence added, 'If the Government
heal the sick they starve the healthy.<Node id="329583" /> <Node id="329584" />If, on the other hand, they
protect the healthy they doom the sick.<Node id="329651" />'<Node id="329652" />

<Node id="329654" />Both his visitors felt a sudden touch of horror.<Node id="329702" /> <Node id="329703" />The dilemma came at
them so suddenly, and on so vast a scale, that they mentally recoiled
from it.<Node id="329801" /> <Node id="329802" />Neither of them was thinking at the moment of any others than
those on whose behalf he imagined himself speaking.<Node id="329915" /> <Node id="329916" />But to each of them
the placid voice of the Home Secretary called up a vision of another
hemisphere of danger and distress; and over that danger and that
distress floated, ironically effective, the Stone.<Node id="330120" /> <Node id="330121" />Of the two the Mayor
suffered the more, for he had the keener sight, and at the same time
the remembrance of his own son struck at his heart.<Node id="330262" /> <Node id="330263" />He saw the silent
railways and the idle workers at the same time that he heard the moans
of the dying man and knew them for the moans of one among thousands.<Node id="330420" /> <Node id="330421" />He
turned sharply on the Minister.<Node id="330455" />

<Node id="330457" />'<Node id="330458" />Is there no way of administering relief,' he asked, 'by the most
careful vigilance?<Node id="330541" />'<Node id="330542" />

<Node id="330544" />'<Node id="330545" />There is no way to protect the Stone if we are to use the Stone,' Mr.
Garterr Browne said.<Node id="330635" /> '<Node id="330637" />And now, gentlemen?<Node id="330656" />'<Node id="330657" />

<Node id="330659" />'<Node id="330660" />I cannot believe it,' the Mayor cried out.<Node id="330702" /> '<Node id="330704" />Is the mind of man
incapable of dealing with this problem?<Node id="330762" /> <Node id="330763" />Or is the Stone sent to mock
us?<Node id="330795" />'<Node id="330796" />

<Node id="330798" />'<Node id="330799" />Well ...<Node id="330807" /> <Node id="330808" />mock?<Node id="330813" />' <Node id="330815" />the Minister asked, 'mock?<Node id="330841" />... <Node id="330845" />But I think probably its
value has been much exaggerated.<Node id="330902" /> <Node id="330903" />We have, of course----'<Node id="330926" />

<Node id="330928" />'<Node id="330929" />But I have seen these things happen,' the Mayor said.<Node id="330982" />

<Node id="330984" />'<Node id="330985" />No doubt, no doubt.<Node id="331004" /> <Node id="331005" />As I was saying,' the Minister went on, 'we have,
of course, our own scientists at work on it.<Node id="331099" /> <Node id="331100" />Analyzing, you know.<Node id="331120" />'<Node id="331121" />

<Node id="331123" />'<Node id="331124" />Who are your scientists?<Node id="331148" />' <Node id="331150" />the Mayor asked.<Node id="331166" />

<Node id="331168" />'<Node id="331169" />Sir Giles Tumulty primarily,' the other answered.<Node id="331218" /> <Node id="331219" />He had never heard of
Sir Giles till the previous evening, but his manner implied that the
name ought to settle the Mayor.<Node id="331341" /> '<Node id="331343" />And no doubt he--they--will find some
means to isolate the curative while--shall we say inhibiting?<Node id="331442" />--<Node id="331444" />the
non-curative elements.<Node id="331470" /> <Node id="331471" />But you must give us time.<Node id="331497" />'<Node id="331498" />

<Node id="331500" />'<Node id="331501" />And am I to go back to Rich and tell the people to die?<Node id="331556" />' <Node id="331558" />the Mayor
asked.<Node id="331574" />

<Node id="331576" />'<Node id="331577" />You talk as if your townsfolk were all the people,' Merridew muttered.<Node id="331647" />
'<Node id="331649" />Aren't there any others to watch for the people than you?<Node id="331706" /> <Node id="331707" />What of the
Unions?<Node id="331726" /> <Node id="331727" />Are my members to starve that your townsfolk may be more
cheerful?<Node id="331793" />'<Node id="331794" />

<Node id="331796" />'<Node id="331797" />It seems,' the Mayor said heavily, 'that this Stone is a very subtle
thing.<Node id="331872" />'<Node id="331873" />

<Node id="331875" />Mr.<Node id="331878" /> <Node id="331879" />Garterr Browne felt that his own mind was at least as good as the
Stone if it came to subtlety.<Node id="331974" /> <Node id="331975" />It had been a difficult situation, and
now everything was coming right.<Node id="332046" /> <Node id="332047" />He looked almost gratefully at Mr.
Merridew, but received no answering glance.<Node id="332125" /> <Node id="332126" />The General Secretary was
beginning to feel anxious about the future.<Node id="332195" />

<Node id="332197" />'<Node id="332198" />At least,' the Mayor said suddenly, 'you will have the whole matter
laid before Parliament, so that we may know what resolution is come to,
and for what reason.<Node id="332358" />'<Node id="332359" />

<Node id="332361" />'<Node id="332362" />I very certainly will not,' Mr. Garterr Browne said, startled at this
new threat of tempest.<Node id="332454" /> '<Node id="332456" />Why, Parliament isn't even sitting.<Node id="332491" /> <Node id="332492" />I shall let
the Cabinet know.<Node id="332521" /> <Node id="332522" />Can't you trust us to do our best?<Node id="332556" />'<Node id="332557" />

<Node id="332559" />Neither of his visitors seemed anxious to do so.<Node id="332607" /> <Node id="332608" />Both of them were
thinking of the crowds, of voices crying out questions, of the demand of
the common people for security and food and content.<Node id="332751" /> <Node id="332752" />In the faint noise
of the traffic of London that came to them in the room there seemed to
be something which must either be laid hold of or itself lay hold.<Node id="332908" />
<Node id="332909" />Merridew saw before him the massed ranks of his Conference.<Node id="332968" /> <Node id="332969" />There was
here a thing which allowed, it seemed, of no arrangement; here was no
question of percentages and scales and wage-modifications over long
periods--things that could be explained and defended.<Node id="333170" /> <Node id="333171" />If it got out, if
the Stone were used publicly, the whole of his Unions would be raging
round him, and all the allied trades.<Node id="333296" /> <Node id="333297" />Yet if the Stone were refused, he
seemed to see in the upright and dangerous figure of the Mayor a threat
of other action, of the outbreak of the sick and the friends of the
sick.<Node id="333476" /> <Node id="333477" />He foresaw division and angry strife, and suddenly looking at the
Home Secretary he cried out in answer to the plaintive appeal--'But this
is civil war!<Node id="333629" />'<Node id="333630" />

<Node id="333632" />The Mayor looked over at him.<Node id="333661" /> '<Node id="333663" />I do not think you are wrong, Mr.
Secretary,' he said.<Node id="333717" /> '<Node id="333719" />We are coming perhaps to evil days.<Node id="333754" />'<Node id="333755" />

<Node id="333757" />'<Node id="333758" />But really, gentlemen,' the Minister began, and then changing his
intention addressed himself to the Mayor.<Node id="333865" /> '<Node id="333867" />Do you not see,' he said,
'that more will suffer if the Stone is used than if it is kept secret?<Node id="333963" />
<Node id="333964" />I am sure we all sympathize with those who are in need of one sort or
another, but you cannot build up a house by pulling it down, nor do
good to some by doing harm to many.<Node id="334137" /> <Node id="334138" />Besides, so little has really been
discovered about this ...<Node id="334198" /> <Node id="334199" />discovery that it's too soon to take a gloomy
view.<Node id="334250" /> <Node id="334251" />You, I am sure, Mr. Mayor, will explain this to the people of
Rich.<Node id="334318" />'<Node id="334319" />

<Node id="334321" />'<Node id="334322" />And if the people of Rich lynch me in the street I shall think it
natural,' the Mayor answered.<Node id="334417" />

<Node id="334419" />There was a knock at the door and a secretary entered.<Node id="334473" /> '<Node id="334475" />Lord Birlesmere
is very anxious to see you, sir,' he said.<Node id="334533" /> '<Node id="334535" />He telephoned from the
Foreign Office just now to know if he could come across.<Node id="334614" />'<Node id="334615" />

<Node id="334617" />'<Node id="334618" />Of course, of course,' Mr. Garterr Browne answered, and then, as
the secretary went out, turned to his visitors.<Node id="334730" /> '<Node id="334732" />Well,' he said,
'I must break off the discussion.<Node id="334781" /> <Node id="334782" />But please don't let there be any
misunderstanding.<Node id="334833" /> <Node id="334834" />The Government will take steps to find out what
the truth really is.<Node id="334902" /> <Node id="334903" />As I said before, there is always likely to
be exaggeration.<Node id="334963" /> <Node id="334964" />And then I will let you know its decision.<Node id="335006" /> <Node id="335007" />Pray,
gentlemen, exercise all your restraining influence, and do not let
there be any talk of civil war.<Node id="335111" /> <Node id="335112" />This is a civilized community.<Node id="335142" />
<Node id="335143" />Your interests--the interests of those you represent--townsfolk or
unionists--will be safe in our hands.<Node id="335247" /> <Node id="335248" />I shall be writing to you both
in a few days.<Node id="335293" /> <Node id="335294" />No, Mr. Mayor, I can't discuss it further at present.<Node id="335347" />
<Node id="335348" />Important things are bound to take time.<Node id="335388" />'<Node id="335389" />

<Node id="335391" />As the two were ushered out Mr. Garterr Browne shook his head
thoughtfully at the still ominous storm.<Node id="335493" /> '<Node id="335495" />What is quite certain,' he
said, 'is that no one must be allowed to believe in this Stone any more.<Node id="335594" />
<Node id="335595" />It simply must not be allowed.<Node id="335625" />'<Node id="335626" />




<Node id="335631" />CHAPTER XIII<Node id="335643" />

<Node id="335645" />THE REFUSAL OF LORD ARGLAY<Node id="335671" />


<Node id="335674" />'<Node id="335675" />Wandsworth?<Node id="335686" />' <Node id="335688" />Professor Palliser said, staring at Sir Giles.<Node id="335734" /> '<Node id="335736" />Why did
you go there?<Node id="335757" />'<Node id="335758" />

<Node id="335760" />'<Node id="335761" />Can't you guess?<Node id="335777" />' <Node id="335779" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="335795" /> '<Node id="335797" />Then I suppose you won't guess
what happened.<Node id="335842" /> <Node id="335843" />Well, I don't mind telling you, Palliser, that for once
neither did I. Nor the Governor, who is a beefy lump of idiocy.<Node id="335962" /> <Node id="335963" />He got
quite upset when he saw it.<Node id="335997" />'<Node id="335998" />

<Node id="336000" />'<Node id="336001" />Saw what?<Node id="336010" />' <Node id="336012" />Palliser asked.<Node id="336027" /> '<Node id="336029" />What have you been doing?<Node id="336054" />'<Node id="336055" />

<Node id="336057" />'<Node id="336058" />I'll tell you,' Sir Giles answered.<Node id="336093" /> '<Node id="336095" />I ought to have foreseen
perhaps--but one doesn't know what the logic of the damned thing is.<Node id="336188" />
<Node id="336189" />Well, I went to Wandsworth.<Node id="336216" /> <Node id="336217" />You know what they have at Wandsworth?<Node id="336255" />'<Node id="336256" />

<Node id="336258" />'<Node id="336259" />Not specially,' Palliser said.<Node id="336289" /> '<Node id="336291" />A common, isn't there?<Node id="336313" /> <Node id="336314" />And a prison?<Node id="336327" />'<Node id="336328" />

<Node id="336330" />'<Node id="336331" />And a Hottentot missionary college, and a seminary for barmaids,' Sir
Giles added.<Node id="336413" /> '<Node id="336415" />What do they have at Wandsworth Prison early in the
mornings?<Node id="336476" />'<Node id="336477" />

<Node id="336479" />'<Node id="336480" />Parades?<Node id="336488" />' <Node id="336490" />Palliser, all at sea, ventured.<Node id="336521" /> '<Node id="336523" />Breakfast?<Node id="336533" /> <Node id="336534" />Chapel?<Node id="336541" />'<Node id="336542" />

<Node id="336544" />'<Node id="336545" />Try all three,' Sir Giles answered.<Node id="336580" /> '<Node id="336582" />Executions, Palliser.<Node id="336603" /> <Node id="336604" />That's
what I went for.<Node id="336627" /> <Node id="336628" />There aren't so many that I could afford to miss one,
especially just after Birlesmere had given me a practically free hand.<Node id="336752" />
<Node id="336753" />So I got a letter out of him and the Home Office scullion and down
I went.<Node id="336827" /> <Node id="336828" />After all, I argued, if this infernal Stone is a kind of
rendezvous of the past and the future and every sort of place I didn't
see why it shouldn't push a man over an interruption, like death.<Node id="337021" /> <Node id="337022" />There
is only one kind of death which is fixed and that's executions.<Node id="337091" /> <Node id="337092" />Even at
hospitals you can't be certain to an hour or two, and anyhow very often
there people don't die intelligently; they lose themselves and drift.<Node id="337241" />
<Node id="337242" />But the fellow who's going to be executed knows about it all right.<Node id="337309" />
<Node id="337310" />The ape-creature who called himself the Governor wouldn't let on to me
whether he usually drugged the victim, but I saw to it he didn't drug
this one.<Node id="337460" /> <Node id="337461" />I wanted all the intelligence I could find--not that there was
much anyhow; he was an undersized slug who'd poisoned a woman because
she'd run away with him without having any money, so far as I could
understand.<Node id="337673" /> <Node id="337674" />Not that it mattered.<Node id="337695" /> <Node id="337696" />I got there before he'd had his
breakfast, and had a little talk, asked him if he'd like to live and so
on.<Node id="337803" /> <Node id="337804" />The warder had been cleared out of the cell, so it was all right.<Node id="337869" /> <Node id="337870" />I
don't know what the wretched creature thought I was offering him, but he
screamed with gratitude--quite a fascinating ten minutes, all twisting
and slobbering.<Node id="338031" /> <Node id="338032" />In fact, I began to think I shouldn't get the idea into
the maggot-hole he had for a brain, but I did, and made him have a
good breakfast too.<Node id="338174" /> <Node id="338175" />Then the chaplain came in and talked about life in
heaven, but my murderer was all for life on earth, and I was worth a
dozen mongrel-faced chaplains to him.<Node id="338332" /> <Node id="338333" />So he was pinioned so that he
could hold one of the Stones--you ought to have seen the Governor
looking like a Sunday school superintendent in a night club or something
worse--and I told him to put everything he knew into choosing to live.<Node id="338572" />
<Node id="338573" />And off we went--he and the hangman and the chaplain and the Governor
and I and everyone.<Node id="338662" /> <Node id="338663" />The funniest thing you ever saw, Palliser--if you
ever did see anything funny.<Node id="338741" /> <Node id="338742" />And there was the trap and everything.<Node id="338780" />
<Node id="338781" />Well, do you know it was only then it occurred to me that I ought to be
underneath--in the pit thing he drops into.<Node id="338896" /> <Node id="338897" />It delayed matters a bit,
but at last they grasped what I wanted: anyone except a malformed baby
of two months would have understood me sooner than that Governor: and
round and down I went.<Node id="339086" /> <Node id="339087" />And down he came.<Node id="339104" />'<Node id="339105" />

<Node id="339107" />Sir Giles paused.<Node id="339124" /> '<Node id="339126" />And now,' he resumed, 'what do you think happened?<Node id="339176" />'<Node id="339177" />

<Node id="339179" />'<Node id="339180" />How do I know?<Node id="339194" />' <Node id="339196" />Palliser exclaimed.<Node id="339215" /> '<Node id="339217" />He was dead?<Node id="339229" />'<Node id="339230" />

<Node id="339232" />'<Node id="339233" />No,' Sir Giles said thoughtfully, 'No, I shouldn't say he was dead.<Node id="339300" />'<Node id="339301" />

<Node id="339303" />'<Node id="339304" />He was alive!<Node id="339317" />' <Node id="339319" />Palliser cried.<Node id="339334" /> '<Node id="339336" />Does it really do away with death?<Node id="339370" />'<Node id="339371" />

<Node id="339373" />'<Node id="339374" />Well, yes, I suppose in a way he was alive,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="339434" /> '<Node id="339436" />He was
quite conscious and so on--one could see that.<Node id="339489" /> <Node id="339490" />The only thing was that
his neck was broken.<Node id="339534" />'<Node id="339535" />

<Node id="339537" />Palliser gaped at him.<Node id="339559" /> <Node id="339560" />In a moment Sir Giles resumed.<Node id="339590" /> '<Node id="339592" />There he was.<Node id="339605" />
<Node id="339606" />Neck broken, everything as it should be, the body dead so to speak.<Node id="339673" /> <Node id="339674" />But
_he_ wasn't.<Node id="339690" /> <Node id="339691" />I can see now that it was my fault in a way.<Node id="339735" /> <Node id="339736" />I was thinking
in terms of continuation of life, so I put him on to that idea, and of
course he swilled it down with his coffee.<Node id="339864" /> <Node id="339865" />But we both forgot to arrange
the conditions, so that the ordinary physical process wasn't interfered
with.<Node id="339972" /> <Node id="339973" />Yet on the other hand his consciousness just stopped there, _in_
his body or wherever it lives.<Node id="340068" /> <Node id="340069" />A damn funny result, Palliser.<Node id="340099" /> <Node id="340100" />If you
could have seen his eyes while he hung there kicking----'<Node id="340164" />

<Node id="340166" />Palliser interrupted.<Node id="340187" /> '<Node id="340189" />But what did you do?<Node id="340209" />' <Node id="340211" />he asked.<Node id="340220" />

<Node id="340222" />Sir Giles shrugged.<Node id="340241" /> '<Node id="340243" />O well, they cut him down, and stuck him in a
bed somewhere privately, and the chaplain postponed any more of the
resurrection and the life and the Governor went off to get more
instructions.<Node id="340434" /> <Node id="340435" />And I hung about a bit--in fact, I've been there all day
on and off; but there doesn't seem to be any change.<Node id="340544" /> <Node id="340545" />There he lies, all
broken up, and just his eyes awake.<Node id="340599" /> <Node id="340600" />No use at all to me or anyone, damn
and blast him for a verminous puppy-dog!<Node id="340676" />'<Node id="340677" />

<Node id="340679" />Palliser moved uneasily.<Node id="340703" /> '<Node id="340705" />I'm beginning to be afraid of it,' he said.<Node id="340748" /> '<Node id="340750" />I
wish we knew what it was.<Node id="340777" />'<Node id="340778" />

<Node id="340780" />'<Node id="340781" />It's the First Matter,' Sir Giles said.<Node id="340820" /> '<Node id="340822" />I told you that was what I
thought it was, and I'm more sure than ever now.<Node id="340897" /> <Node id="340898" />It's that which becomes
everything else.<Node id="340938" />'<Node id="340939" />

<Node id="340941" />'<Node id="340942" />But how does it work?<Node id="340963" />' <Node id="340965" />Palliser asked.<Node id="340980" /> '<Node id="340982" />How does all this movement
happen?<Node id="341016" /> <Node id="341017" />How does it carry anyone about in space?<Node id="341057" />'<Node id="341058" />

<Node id="341060" />'<Node id="341061" />It doesn't,' Sir Giles answered immediately.<Node id="341105" /> '<Node id="341107" />Can't you see that it
doesn't move people about like an aeroplane display?<Node id="341181" /> <Node id="341182" />Once you are in
contact and you choose and desire and will, you go into it and come out
again where you have desired because everything is in it, anyhow.<Node id="341335" /> <Node id="341336" />Do try
and see further than a wax doll on a Christmas tree can.<Node id="341399" />'<Node id="341400" />

<Node id="341402" />'<Node id="341403" />So that if you were set in contact you might, even if you only partly
knew...<Node id="341480" />?' <Node id="341483" />Palliser began slowly and stopped.<Node id="341517" />

<Node id="341519" />'<Node id="341520" />I expect so,' Sir Giles said sweetly, 'if your hearse of a mind could
only get to the cemetery a bit quicker.<Node id="341629" /> <Node id="341630" />What might you?<Node id="341645" />'<Node id="341646" />

<Node id="341648" />'<Node id="341649" />I was thinking of Pondon,' Palliser went on.<Node id="341693" /> '<Node id="341695" />That might explain how it
was that he's ...<Node id="341738" /> <Node id="341739" />returned?<Node id="341748" />'<Node id="341749" />

<Node id="341751" />'<Node id="341752" />He's what?<Node id="341762" />' <Node id="341764" />Sir Giles said sharply.<Node id="341787" /> '<Node id="341789" />What d'you mean, Palliser?<Node id="341815" /> <Node id="341816" />He
hadn't a Stone, had he?<Node id="341842" />'<Node id="341843" />

<Node id="341845" />'<Node id="341846" />Your brother-in-law must have done it,' Palliser answered, feeling some
pleasure at the connexion.<Node id="341944" /> '<Node id="341946" />You know you thought you saw him when we
were trying to get at Pondon the other night and failed.<Node id="342043" /> <Node id="342044" />There seems to
have been a paragraph in the paper, but I missed that.<Node id="342113" /> <Node id="342114" />But when I got
to Birmingham yesterday morning, he was there.<Node id="342175" /> <Node id="342176" />He'd been found in the
laboratory when my demonstrator went in at about ten o'clock.<Node id="342260" /> <Node id="342261" />He was a
bit bewildered then, I gathered, so I went round to see him.<Node id="342330" /> <Node id="342331" />And who do
you think I found there?<Node id="342366" />'<Node id="342367" />

<Node id="342369" />'<Node id="342370" />Arglay!<Node id="342377" />' <Node id="342379" />Sir Giles exclaimed.<Node id="342399" /> '<Node id="342401" />By God, I'll tear Arglay into bits.<Node id="342436" />'<Node id="342437" />

<Node id="342439" />'<Node id="342440" />Not Arglay,' Palliser went on, 'but that girl who was with him--his
secretary.<Node id="342518" /> <Node id="342519" />She'd told him some tale and got on his right side, for there
he was talking away to her, and telling her how he couldn't make out
what had happened.<Node id="342668" /> <Node id="342669" />I was rather sorry I'd turned up at first, though he
was quite all right with me--asked me if the vibrations were all right.<Node id="342793" />
<Node id="342794" />You remember we told him some tale about testing etheric vibrations--on
the lines of my _Discontinuous Integer_?<Node id="342906" />'<Node id="342907" />

<Node id="342909" />'<Node id="342910" />He was damn near being a discontinuous integer himself,' Sir Giles said
snappily.<Node id="342991" /> '<Node id="342993" />And what had Arglay's woman to say about it?<Node id="343037" />'<Node id="343038" />

<Node id="343040" />'<Node id="343041" />I don't like it,' Palliser answered.<Node id="343077" /> '<Node id="343079" />O she didn't _say_ much, just
cooed at him now and then.<Node id="343135" /> <Node id="343136" />But from what he said, while he was doing his
job as usual, he found his hand holding this Stone--and he knew he'd
been holding it, so (as far as I could understand) he took a tighter
grip and said to himself, "This is where I ought to be.<Node id="343375" />" <Node id="343377" />And then he
remembers pitching right over, and there the demonstrator found him.<Node id="343457" /> <Node id="343458" />But
that girl and Arglay have had something to do with it, and if they're
going to interfere continually----'<Node id="343567" />

<Node id="343569" />Sir Giles put up a hand as if for silence, and sat meditating for
several minutes.<Node id="343651" /> <Node id="343652" />Then he drew a deep breath and got up.<Node id="343690" /> '<Node id="343692" />I'm going to
try something,' he said.<Node id="343729" /> '<Node id="343731" />I've had enough of this young Hecate mixing
herself up with my affairs because that bestial leprachaun who employs
her tells her to.<Node id="343863" /> <Node id="343864" />I'll give Miss Chloe Burnett something else to do with
her mind, and perhaps with mine.<Node id="343951" /> <Node id="343952" />If she can use the Stone so can other
people.<Node id="343997" /> <Node id="343998" />Where is it?<Node id="344010" /> <Node id="344011" />Go away now, Palliser, and let me try.<Node id="344049" />'<Node id="344050" />

<Node id="344052" />It was perhaps the greatest mistake which Giles Tumulty had ever made
to allow what had been in general a cold, if rather horrible, sincerity
of investigation into remote states of mind to become violently shaken
by a personal hatred of his brother-in-law.<Node id="344308" /> <Node id="344309" />He and Arglay had always
mutually despised each other, but until now they had never been in
conflict.<Node id="344410" /> <Node id="344411" />The chances of the last few days however had turned them from
contemptuous acquaintances into definite enemies.<Node id="344522" /> <Node id="344523" />Indeed at that moment,
though no one of those connected with the progress of the Stone and its
Types had realized it, the Chief Justice and his secretary were becoming
the only single-minded adherents it possessed.<Node id="344737" /> <Node id="344738" />Lord Arglay certainly
could not be thought to feel any passionate devotion to it; but he
strongly disliked all that he saw and felt of the greed by which it was
surrounded.<Node id="344910" /> <Node id="344911" />The Persian Government, the English Government, the American
millionaire and his wife--these he knew; and there were others he did
not know--Merridew and Frank Lindsay; even, in some sense, though a
holier, the Mayor of Rich and the Hajji Ibrahim.<Node id="345158" /> <Node id="345159" />All for good or evil
desired to recover the Stone, and use it, and most of them desired
greatly to possess all its Types as well.<Node id="345288" /> <Node id="345289" />Doncaster and Mrs. Pentridge
hardly knew enough or were hardly in sufficient contact with the
movements it had caused to make any demand.<Node id="345426" /> <Node id="345427" />But Lord Arglay, at once in
contact and detached, at once faithless and believing, beheld all these
things in the light of that fastidious and ironical goodwill which,
outside mystical experience, is the finest and noblest capacity man has
developed in and against the universe.<Node id="345705" /> <Node id="345706" />And now this itself was touched
by a warmer consciousness, for as far as might be within his protection
and certainly within his willing friendship, there was growing the
intense secret of Chloe's devotion to the Mystery.<Node id="345927" /> <Node id="345928" />As if a Joseph with
more agnostic irony than tradition usually allows him sheltered and
sustained a Mary of a more tempestuous past than the Virgin-Mother is
believed to have either endured or enjoyed, so Lord Arglay considered,
as far as it was clear to him, his friend's progress towards the End of
Desire.<Node id="346236" /> <Node id="346237" />To that shelter and sustenance she had eagerly returned from her
absence on the Birmingham errand, and she and her companion were now
telling him and the Hajji, who had been summoned, of the occurrences of
that errand.<Node id="346455" />

<Node id="346457" />Of one thing however Chloe did not speak.<Node id="346498" /> <Node id="346499" />She might have gradually
revealed it to Lord Arglay, but she certainly was not going to mention
it before the Hajji, and as in a way Mr. Doncaster was it or the
occasion of it she could not before him.<Node id="346700" /> <Node id="346701" />Chloe had usually found a
fairly long train journey--especially in the first class compartment
Lord Arglay had naturally assumed she would take--in the company of an
intelligent and personable young man who rather obviously admired her,
a very pleasant, and even exciting, method of spending the time.<Node id="347002" /> <Node id="347003" />There
was so happy a mixture of the known and the unknown; there was all the
possibility of advance and yet all the surety of withdrawal--there was
in short such admirable country for campaigning that she could not very
clearly understand why she had to-day looked at it without any thought
of a campaign.<Node id="347308" /> <Node id="347309" />She had thrown out a squadron or so to check Mr.
Doncaster's early moves, and had with small expenditure of effort
immobilized him.<Node id="347440" /> <Node id="347441" />The journeys were ended and there was no regret.<Node id="347489" /> <Node id="347490" />She
must, Chloe thought when she became conscious of this, be terribly
excited.<Node id="347569" /> <Node id="347570" />But she was not excited.<Node id="347594" /> <Node id="347595" />She only wanted to serve the
Stone--and Lord Arglay--as much as Lord Arglay--and the Stone--wanted.<Node id="347694" />
<Node id="347695" />There was a slight doubt in her mind which of them, if it came to a
crisis, was the more important, but it hadn't come to a crisis and very
likely never would.<Node id="347854" /> <Node id="347855" />Once or twice her experience in the operation which
she and the Chief Justice had directed occurred to her; with the
suggestion of a possibility that there indeed a choice beyond her
knowledge had been made and a first separation from mortality dutifully
and sadly undergone.<Node id="348130" /> <Node id="348131" />It would have seemed to her silly and pretentious
to put it like that, but when she said to herself: 'I don't think
perhaps I shall care about it so much,' it might have meant much the
same thing, at least to any of the Types of the Stone or to the wisdom
of Suleiman ben Daood, king in Jerusalem.<Node id="348428" />

<Node id="348430" />'<Node id="348431" />We went to the University first,' Doncaster was saying, 'but he wasn't
there, and they didn't or wouldn't know anything, so we went to his
house.<Node id="348576" />'<Node id="348577" />

<Node id="348579" />'<Node id="348580" />How did you find it?<Node id="348600" />' <Node id="348602" />the Chief Justice put in.<Node id="348627" />

<Node id="348629" />'<Node id="348630" />Telephone Directory,' Doncaster said.<Node id="348667" /> '<Node id="348669" />That was my idea--I thought in
his position he'd almost _have_ to be on, and he was.<Node id="348753" /> <Node id="348754" />But it was Miss
Burnett got us into the house--the usual kind of house; just the thing
you'd expect of him.<Node id="348861" /> <Node id="348862" />He lived with his mother, and I thought we could
swear we were journalists; but before I could say anything----' He
paused and looked at Chloe.<Node id="349005" />

<Node id="349007" />'<Node id="349008" />And what did Miss Burnett swear you were?<Node id="349049" />' <Node id="349051" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="349069" />

<Node id="349071" />'<Node id="349072" />I said we were his friends,' Chloe answered, with a simplicity and a
certainty in her voice which--Arglay thought--would have opened any
doors.<Node id="349215" /> <Node id="349216" />Some new completeness seemed to be growing in her.<Node id="349266" /> <Node id="349267" />He permitted
himself to test it with another question.<Node id="349321" />

<Node id="349323" />'<Node id="349324" />And did you also think it was the kind of house you would expect of
him?<Node id="349396" />' <Node id="349398" />he asked, throwing a side glance of humorous apology at Doncaster.<Node id="349464" />

<Node id="349466" />Chloe frowned a little.<Node id="349489" /> '<Node id="349491" />I don't think I know,' she said.<Node id="349523" /> '<Node id="349525" />I mean, I
didn't expect anything.<Node id="349558" /> <Node id="349559" />It was--it was a house, and he and his mother
lived in it.<Node id="349617" /> <Node id="349618" />I don't see what more one could say.<Node id="349654" />'<Node id="349655" />

<Node id="349657" />'<Node id="349658" />It didn't,' Arglay asked again, 'seem to you of any particular kind?<Node id="349726" />'<Node id="349727" />

<Node id="349729" />'<Node id="349730" />It was a very nice house,' Chloe said, 'but--no, I didn't notice
anything else.<Node id="349809" />'<Node id="349810" />

<Node id="349812" />'<Node id="349813" />It had an aspidistra in the window,' Doncaster put in.<Node id="349867" />

<Node id="349869" />'<Node id="349870" />It certainly had,' Chloe agreed, 'and a very good aspidistra too.<Node id="349935" /> <Node id="349936" />I
admired it.<Node id="349949" />'<Node id="349950" />

<Node id="349952" />Lord Arglay signed to Doncaster to go on--after a slightly perplexed
glance at Chloe, he obeyed.<Node id="350048" />

<Node id="350050" />'<Node id="350051" />So Miss Burnett said, "We are his friends," and his mother let us in
and took us to the aspidistra, and presently he came in.<Node id="350176" /> <Node id="350177" />So we--at least
Miss Burnett--told him she knew all about it....<Node id="350241" />'<Node id="350242" />

<Node id="350244" />'<Node id="350245" />Did you?<Node id="350253" />' <Node id="350255" />Arglay interrupted.<Node id="350274" />

<Node id="350276" />'<Node id="350277" />Well, in a way,' Chloe answered.<Node id="350309" /> '<Node id="350311" />It seemed as if he thought he had
seen me before; he looked at me so hesitatingly at first.<Node id="350402" /> <Node id="350403" />And I said I
knew something of what had happened, and was anxious to know if we could
do anything more to help him.<Node id="350518" /> <Node id="350519" />So we ...<Node id="350528" /> <Node id="350529" />we stammered a little at one
another, and then he broke out.<Node id="350589" /> <Node id="350590" />He said he didn't know what had
happened.<Node id="350631" /> <Node id="350632" />He remembered Professor Palliser talking to him about etheric
vibrations, and asking him to test them by wishing--he said wishing--to
be at an earlier point of time, and then he wondered if he had been.<Node id="350834" />'<Node id="350835" />

<Node id="350837" />'<Node id="350838" />He was very muddled about it all,' Doncaster added.<Node id="350889" /> '<Node id="350891" />And about what
happened afterwards: he was doing his job in his usual manner and
suddenly he felt as if he were holding on to a post and something was
saying to him, "This is the Way.<Node id="351074" />" <Node id="351076" />He couldn't get nearer than that.<Node id="351109" /> <Node id="351110" />And
he saw a kind of photograph in the air.<Node id="351153" />'<Node id="351154" />

<Node id="351156" />'<Node id="351157" />A what?<Node id="351164" />' <Node id="351166" />Lord Arglay exclaimed.<Node id="351188" />

<Node id="351190" />'<Node id="351191" />He didn't say a photograph,' Chloe cried out.<Node id="351236" /> '<Node id="351238" />He said a picture.<Node id="351256" />'<Node id="351257" />

<Node id="351259" />'<Node id="351260" />He said, to be exact, "a picture just like a photograph,"' Doncaster
insisted, 'of the same room.<Node id="351357" /> <Node id="351358" />And it got bigger.<Node id="351376" /> <Node id="351377" />But go on, Miss
Burnett.<Node id="351401" />'<Node id="351402" />

<Node id="351404" />'<Node id="351405" />I think he saw them in the Unity,' Chloe said.<Node id="351451" /> '<Node id="351453" />He said he felt as if
he were standing between them, and he didn't know which he ought to be
in, but it was frightfully important for him to choose rightly.<Node id="351609" /> <Node id="351610" />And he
wondered which the Professor and his friends wanted.<Node id="351669" /> <Node id="351670" />But then he thought
he saw ...<Node id="351700" />' <Node id="351702" />she hesitated ...<Node id="351719" /> '<Node id="351721" />me in one of them, and moved to ask
whether I wanted to see the Professor!<Node id="351795" />'<Node id="351796" />

<Node id="351798" />'<Node id="351799" />And then crashed,' Doncaster ended.<Node id="351834" /> '<Node id="351836" />And knew nothing more.<Node id="351858" /> <Node id="351859" />It was at
that point that the Professor arrived.<Node id="351907" /> <Node id="351908" />He looked a trifle embarrassed
when the mother brought him in and he saw Miss Burnett--embarrassed
first and then rather annoyed.<Node id="352037" /> <Node id="352038" />So there was general conversation for
awhile, and I chatted to the Professor--at least, I asked him what he
thought of it all, while Miss Burnett and Pondon talked.<Node id="352202" /> <Node id="352203" />And then we
came away.<Node id="352225" />'<Node id="352226" />

<Node id="352228" />'<Node id="352229" />I like the notion that he thought you wanted Palliser,' Lord Arglay
said contentedly.<Node id="352314" /> '<Node id="352316" />The Stone seems to have a subtle irony of its own.<Node id="352366" />
<Node id="352367" />But why _you_?<Node id="352381" /> <Node id="352382" />Very much pleasanter for him, of course; but I had an
idea, from what you said, that I was doing most of the work.<Node id="352496" /> <Node id="352497" />Why didn't
he see me?<Node id="352518" />'<Node id="352519" />

<Node id="352521" />'<Node id="352522" />It may be,' the Hajji said, 'that it was by your work that this man
beheld her.<Node id="352601" /> <Node id="352602" />For all that you showed him was the Stone, and it may be
that Miss Burnett's work was in the Stone, and that he beheld her there.<Node id="352731" />
<Node id="352732" />It was, in its degree, redemption which you offered him, and if she was
toiling also at redemption--the Way to the Stone is in the Stone.<Node id="352869" />'<Node id="352870" />

<Node id="352872" />'<Node id="352873" />And yet his desire was to do what Palliser wished,' Arglay demurred.<Node id="352941" />

<Node id="352943" />'<Node id="352944" />His desire was to fulfil good as he knew it,' the Hajji said.<Node id="353005" />
'<Node id="353007" />Therefore he was capable of receiving within those conditions the End
of Desire, which is eternally good.<Node id="353112" />'<Node id="353113" />

<Node id="353115" />'<Node id="353116" />All times are within it and all places, it seems,' Arglay said.<Node id="353179" /> '<Node id="353181" />Are
not therefore its own Types within itself?<Node id="353227" />'<Node id="353228" />

<Node id="353230" />'<Node id="353231" />I think that is true,' the Hajji answered.<Node id="353273" /> '<Node id="353275" />Certainly therefore this
Thing contains its own Unity; it is for us to find the path by which
that Unity may be manifested.<Node id="353398" />'<Node id="353399" />

<Node id="353401" />'<Node id="353402" />It seems to me,' Doncaster began....<Node id="353438" />

<Node id="353440" />For some time Chloe had been conscious of a restlessness which she had
been trying in vain to subdue.<Node id="353541" /> <Node id="353542" />She was tired or something, she supposed,
but things looked different somehow.<Node id="353620" /> <Node id="353621" />What a lot of bother everyone was
making!<Node id="353662" /> <Node id="353663" />after all, there were other things in the world.<Node id="353711" /> <Node id="353712" />And all this
talk about redemption and the End of Desire.<Node id="353769" /> <Node id="353770" />The end of desire was to
get what you wanted.<Node id="353815" /> <Node id="353816" />The Hajji was rather a silly little old man, she
thought, with his Compassionates and his Muhammeds and his Peace be upon
him and his under the Protection--what protection and from what?<Node id="354002" /> <Node id="354003" />A
little intelligent watchfulness was all the protection she needed, and
she could supply that herself.<Node id="354106" /> <Node id="354107" />As for Lord Arglay--Lord Arglay, it
occurred to her, was unmarried, and if not rich--he could hardly be
that--still he must have....<Node id="354239" /> <Node id="354240" />And no-one but Reginald Montague to leave
it to!<Node id="354288" /> <Node id="354289" />Old men sometimes ...<Node id="354310" /> <Node id="354311" />after all he wasn't repulsive.<Node id="354341" /> <Node id="354342" />If he
married Chloe Burnett, Chloe Burnett would have a more comfortable life.<Node id="354420" />
<Node id="354421" />And if he didn't marry still he was the kind of man who would probably
treat his mistress very fairly.<Node id="354523" /> <Node id="354524" />Suppose he had one already?<Node id="354551" /> <Node id="354552" />That must be
seen to.<Node id="354573" /> <Node id="354574" />Chloe Burnett might not be exactly beautiful, but she had (so
she had been told) a genius for making the most of herself and her art.<Node id="354707" />
<Node id="354708" />There wouldn't be many mistresses who could outdo her if it really came
to a tussle.<Node id="354792" />

<Node id="354794" />The Hajji stopped speaking, Lord Arglay stirred, and Chloe woke to
sudden anxiety.<Node id="354876" /> <Node id="354877" />What on earth had she been thinking?<Node id="354913" /> <Node id="354914" />Thoughts had passed
through her mind in their usual way, but not--surely not!<Node id="354991" />--<Node id="354993" />usual
thoughts.<Node id="355008" /> <Node id="355009" />Had she really been guessing how much money Lord Arglay had,
and whether she could get it?<Node id="355099" /> <Node id="355100" />Had she really been planning to use the
hands clasped beneath her chin to trap him?<Node id="355183" /> <Node id="355184" />Now if it had been this
young Doncaster man ...<Node id="355231" /> <Node id="355232" />his hair would be rather pleasant to pull rather
hard, he had thick hair; and well-made wrists, better than Frank's.<Node id="355348" /> <Node id="355349" />Not
that there would be any need to give up Frank, or anyhow not entirely.<Node id="355423" />
<Node id="355424" />Chloe Burnett could deal with them as Sir Giles dealt with Arglay and
the Hajji or the fellow at Birmingham, a silly fellow as she remembered
him.<Node id="355570" /> <Node id="355571" />Useful no doubt in a way, and amusing to think of him lost in the
past.<Node id="355642" /> <Node id="355643" />But very, very dull and only meant to be made use of by other
people much more intelligent--Sir Giles for instance.<Node id="355758" />

<Node id="355760" />'<Node id="355761" />Bloody fool!<Node id="355773" />' <Node id="355775" />Chloe said aloud.<Node id="355792" />

<Node id="355794" />As Oliver Doncaster had just begun 'It seems to me----' her words
caused, even in that company, a moment's attention.<Node id="355911" /> <Node id="355912" />Oliver stopped
speaking with a shock and found himself faced with the unbelievable.<Node id="355995" /> <Node id="355996" />The
Hajji turned on her a look of sudden alarm.<Node id="356043" /> <Node id="356044" />Lord Arglay, taking her in
with a side glance, said casually--'Not you, Mr. Doncaster; I think
probably Palliser.<Node id="356157" /> <Node id="356158" />But in any case we have for the moment done what we
can.<Node id="356214" /> <Node id="356215" />Would it be too much to ask you to call in the morning?<Node id="356270" />'<Node id="356271" />

<Node id="356273" />Oliver had had earlier some general expectation of seeing Chloe home.<Node id="356342" />
<Node id="356343" />But he wasn't as clear as the Chief Justice that the words hadn't been
meant for him, and of course if that was what she thought the sooner he
got away the better.<Node id="356506" /> <Node id="356507" />Dare he risk shaking hands?<Node id="356534" /> <Node id="356535" />He offered her his as
charmingly as possible.<Node id="356580" /> '<Node id="356582" />Very well, Lord Arglay,' he said.<Node id="356615" /> '<Node id="356617" />Good-night,
Miss Burnett.<Node id="356642" /> <Node id="356643" />Thank you for letting me come to Birmingham.<Node id="356687" />'<Node id="356688" />

<Node id="356690" />Chloe gave him her hand and looked at him.<Node id="356732" /> <Node id="356733" />Oliver who had been all day
conscious of being held at an emotional distance discovered, with the
second shock in two minutes, that he was being deliberately invited to
be--understanding.<Node id="356920" /> <Node id="356921" />Her fingers caressed for a moment the back of his
hand; her mouth shaped itself for the kiss the circumstances forbade;
her eyes mourned rebukingly over his departure.<Node id="357088" /> '<Node id="357090" />Good-night, Mr.
Doncaster,' said a voice full of suggestions of intimacies that, so far
as he could remember, hadn't happened, 'We may meet--again--in the
morning then?<Node id="357258" />'<Node id="357259" />

<Node id="357261" />'<Node id="357262" />She can't have meant him,' the Chief Justice thought to himself.<Node id="357326" /> '<Node id="357328" />But
it certainly sounded as if she did.<Node id="357367" /> "<Node id="357369" />Bloody fool"--it's the way these
modern young creatures talk.<Node id="357430" /> <Node id="357431" />Yes, but not here, not--with other people
about--to me.<Node id="357486" /> <Node id="357487" />I shouldn't have thought she'd have done that.<Node id="357533" /> <Node id="357534" />Still--she
did.<Node id="357549" /> <Node id="357550" />No,' he thought suddenly.<Node id="357575" /> '<Node id="357577" />I don't believe it.<Node id="357596" /> <Node id="357597" />She never talked
like that--except for amusement or from bitterness.<Node id="357665" /> <Node id="357666" />And never _so_.<Node id="357681" /> <Node id="357682" />She
is civilized; she is in obedience to the Law.<Node id="357731" />'<Node id="357732" />

<Node id="357734" />He had been taking Oliver to the door while he was thinking and once
that was closed he hastened back to the study.<Node id="357849" /> <Node id="357850" />Chloe was standing by the
fireplace, looking round the room.<Node id="357910" /> <Node id="357911" />Lord Arglay had seen her standing
just there often enough, but in her eyes now there was a difference.<Node id="358013" />
<Node id="358014" />They surveyed, they considered, they calculated; so much he saw before
she brought them back to meet his with a smile.<Node id="358132" /> <Node id="358133" />But even that had
something unnatural about it, a determination of quite another kind from
that which had on other occasions once or twice appeared in the depths
of her look, a hardness alien to the secretary the Chief Justice knew.<Node id="358365" />
<Node id="358366" />For a moment, as their glances met, this gave place to a sudden
bewilderment, but before he could say a word she had turned aside and
was looking towards the window.<Node id="358531" /> <Node id="358532" />Lord Arglay looked round for the Hajji,
who had apparently withdrawn into some corner, and found him at last by
his elbow.<Node id="358654" /> <Node id="358655" />In that room they were far enough from Chloe not to be heard
if they spoke softly, and in a such a tone the Hajji said: 'Something
has frightened you?<Node id="358805" />'<Node id="358806" />

<Node id="358808" />'<Node id="358809" />No,' Arglay answered, 'not frightened.<Node id="358847" /> <Node id="358848" />I was a little startled, but I
expect it's all right.<Node id="358901" /> <Node id="358902" />No doubt Miss Burnett is a little overtired.<Node id="358946" />'<Node id="358947" />

<Node id="358949" />'<Node id="358950" />I do not know Miss Burnett,' the Hajji said, 'except that I saw the
Name upon her forehead.<Node id="359041" /> <Node id="359042" />But I have watched her eyes, and I think you are
right to be anxious.<Node id="359111" />'<Node id="359112" />

<Node id="359114" />'<Node id="359115" />Why?<Node id="359119" />' <Node id="359121" />Arglay said abruptly.<Node id="359142" />

<Node id="359144" />'<Node id="359145" />Her eyes and her mouth have changed,' the Hajji answered.<Node id="359202" /> '<Node id="359204" />They are
curious and greedy--and even malicious.<Node id="359252" /> <Node id="359253" />And if, as I think, she is not
by nature greedy or malicious....<Node id="359317" />'<Node id="359318" />

<Node id="359320" />He paused, but Arglay only said, 'Well?<Node id="359359" />'<Node id="359360" />

<Node id="359362" />'<Node id="359363" />Then,' the Hajji concluded, 'something or someone is making her so.<Node id="359430" />'<Node id="359431" />

<Node id="359433" />In case Chloe should catch his eyes again Lord Arglay looked at the
Hajji and said, 'It seems a damn silly thing to try to do.<Node id="359559" /> <Node id="359560" />What good
would it be?<Node id="359582" />'<Node id="359583" />

<Node id="359585" />'<Node id="359586" />It might be a good deal of good,' the Hajji said, 'if indeed they
desire to obtain the Types which you have.<Node id="359694" /> <Node id="359695" />But even if not, have you
never known men act from hate and anger alone?<Node id="359767" />'<Node id="359768" />

<Node id="359770" />'<Node id="359771" />And is this also, if it is so,' Lord Arglay said, ironically, 'part of
the miracle of the Stone?<Node id="359867" />'<Node id="359868" />

<Node id="359870" />'<Node id="359871" />I warned you that there might be much evil,' the Hajji answered, and
fell silent.<Node id="359952" />

<Node id="359954" />Lord Arglay glanced again at Chloe.<Node id="359989" /> '<Node id="359991" />You think they may be playing
tricks on her?<Node id="360035" />' <Node id="360037" />he asked, but more as if in courteous conversation than
in inquiry, and the other did not trouble to answer.<Node id="360145" /> <Node id="360146" />At last, 'Well,' he
went on, 'if this is so I will do what can be done.<Node id="360217" />'<Node id="360218" />

<Node id="360220" />'<Node id="360221" />Will you try and find her in the Stone?<Node id="360260" />' <Node id="360262" />the Hajji asked.<Node id="360278" />

<Node id="360280" />'<Node id="360281" />No,' Arglay answered, 'no, I do not think I will take up the Stone.<Node id="360348" />
<Node id="360349" />Between her and me I will not have any even of these things.<Node id="360409" />'<Node id="360410" />

<Node id="360412" />'<Node id="360413" />You love her?<Node id="360426" />' <Node id="360428" />the Hajji said, half in statement, half in
interrogation.<Node id="360485" />

<Node id="360487" />'<Node id="360488" />Why, I do not very well know what love may be,' Lord Arglay said, 'but
so far as is possible to men I think that there is Justice between her
and me, and if that Justice cannot help us now I do not think that any
miracles will.<Node id="360715" />'<Node id="360716" />

<Node id="360718" />'<Node id="360719" />This is a very rare thing,' the Hajji said doubtfully.<Node id="360773" />

<Node id="360775" />'<Node id="360776" />My secretary,' Lord Arglay said, half-lightly, half-seriously, 'is a
very rare young lady.<Node id="360866" />' <Node id="360868" />His voice became entirely serious, as he added,
'And if it is Giles, I will perhaps kill him to-morrow.<Node id="360971" /> <Node id="360972" />But now I will
see what is at work here.<Node id="361012" />'<Node id="361013" />

<Node id="361015" />'<Node id="361016" />Cannot I help you?<Node id="361034" />' <Node id="361036" />the other asked.<Node id="361052" />

<Node id="361054" />'<Node id="361055" />No,' Arglay said.<Node id="361072" /> '<Node id="361074" />I will do this alone.<Node id="361095" /> <Node id="361096" />Good-night.<Node id="361107" />'<Node id="361108" />

<Node id="361110" />He shook hands and opened the door.<Node id="361145" /> <Node id="361146" />The Hajji, without going nearer,
bowed to Chloe and walked out.<Node id="361209" /> <Node id="361210" />Lord Arglay shut the door and strolled
across the room.<Node id="361265" />

<Node id="361267" />'<Node id="361268" />I thought he was never going,' Chloe said.<Node id="361310" />

<Node id="361312" />The remark was so perfectly normal that for a moment the Chief Justice
felt almost idiotically defeated.<Node id="361416" /> <Node id="361417" />But something reminded him that Chloe
had never been the kind of secretary who remarked in that way on her
employer's visitors.<Node id="361544" /> <Node id="361545" />She would have thought it presumptuous and rude,
and the affection that had grown between them had never made her more
careless of her behaviour as a subordinate or as a friend.<Node id="361722" /> <Node id="361723" />In both
capacities the remark was inadmissible, and Lord Arglay knew it as he
took the last three steps that brought him level with her.<Node id="361859" /> <Node id="361860" />He smiled at
her and for a moment considered.<Node id="361905" />

<Node id="361907" />'<Node id="361908" />Do you feel very tired?<Node id="361931" />' <Node id="361933" />he asked.<Node id="361942" />

<Node id="361944" />'<Node id="361945" />Well, it was a hell of a journey,' Chloe said, 'but no--not if you want
me, I mean.<Node id="362028" />'<Node id="362029" />

<Node id="362031" />'<Node id="362032" />Too tired,' Lord Arglay said, 'to do a little _Organic Law_?<Node id="362092" />'<Node id="362093" />

<Node id="362095" />Chloe looked at him blankly for a moment.<Node id="362136" /> '<Node id="362138" />O!<Node id="362140" />' <Node id="362142" />she exclaimed, and
before she could add any more the Chief Justice went on easily, 'I want
you to consider it in connexion with our last night's resolution.<Node id="362298" /> <Node id="362299" />I want
you to _think_.<Node id="362321" />' <Node id="362323" />His voice on the last word became suddenly
authoritative.<Node id="362380" />

<Node id="362382" />Chloe laid a hand on his arm.<Node id="362411" /> '<Node id="362413" />I am _rather_ tired,' she said, 'but of
course if you must have it done----' The hand slid down his arm to his
hand and lingered there.<Node id="362548" /> <Node id="362549" />Lord Arglay took it and held it.<Node id="362581" /> '<Node id="362583" />Yes,
_think_,' he said.<Node id="362606" /> '<Node id="362608" />Think, very carefully, yourself.<Node id="362640" />'<Node id="362641" />

<Node id="362643" />Chloe pouted.<Node id="362656" /> '<Node id="362658" />What about?<Node id="362669" />' <Node id="362671" />she said.<Node id="362680" /> '<Node id="362682" />Isn't there anything better to
do?<Node id="362716" /> <Node id="362717" />It's you that ought to think, not me.<Node id="362754" />'<Node id="362755" />

<Node id="362757" />'<Node id="362758" />Good God!<Node id="362767" />' <Node id="362769" />Lord Arglay said, really annoyed, 'don't talk such rubbish,
child.<Node id="362835" />'<Node id="362836" />

<Node id="362838" />A quick tremor shook Chloe, she released his hand, and slid round to
face him.<Node id="362916" /> '<Node id="362918" />Am I a child?<Node id="362931" />' <Node id="362933" />she said, and suddenly anger contended with
cunning in her eyes.<Node id="362997" /> <Node id="362998" />She paused uncertainly, as if something within her,
unaccustomed to the instrument it was using, was fumbling with it; she
half put out her hand again and withdrew it; she leaned forward but
whether in desire or hate Arglay could not tell.<Node id="363237" /> <Node id="363238" />He kept his eyes on
her now, saying nothing for a moment that the remembrance of the Chloe
Burnett he knew might gather more mightily within him.<Node id="363383" /> <Node id="363384" />For the change
that had come upon her was provoked by no natural alteration of mood,
and for a moment he wondered whether indeed he had been wise in this
extremity to refuse the mysterious capacities of the Stone.<Node id="363597" /> <Node id="363598" />If he could
use it to rescue Pondon might he not with a thousand times more reason
use it here?<Node id="363693" /> <Node id="363694" />Might it not be a wise and proper thing to do?<Node id="363740" /> <Node id="363741" />But however
wise or proper it might be he knew he could not; to do so would be
already to confess defeat--there was something else on which he relied
and it was the mere fact that they two were what they were and had been
what they had been.<Node id="363982" />

<Node id="363984" />He said, with a certain slowness, 'Child, I would have you think of what
we chose to do.<Node id="364072" />'<Node id="364073" />

<Node id="364075" />'<Node id="364076" />I do not want to think of anything that is past,' she answered
sullenly, and to that he said in a growing passion of authority, 'But I
will have you do this, and therefore you shall do it now.<Node id="364268" /> <Node id="364269" />I will have
you do it.<Node id="364291" />'<Node id="364292" />

<Node id="364294" />She moved her head from side to side as if to avoid the charge he laid
upon her; then, abandoning a direct refusal, she said in almost a
whisper, 'But first let us think of other things.<Node id="364480" />'<Node id="364481" />

<Node id="364483" />'<Node id="364484" />Child,' he answered, 'the things of which you would think are neither
here nor there, nor do you think of them.<Node id="364595" /> <Node id="364596" />You think and you shall think
of all that we have done together, and of how we determined to believe
in God.<Node id="364704" />'<Node id="364705" />

<Node id="364707" />'<Node id="364708" />I will believe in you instead,' Chloe said and took a small step
forward in the small distance that separated them.<Node id="364823" />

<Node id="364825" />The sentence was so unexpected, she was herself so close, that Arglay
for a moment hesitated.<Node id="364918" /> <Node id="364919" />It was not so much desire for her that filled
him as a willingness to accept himself on those terms, to take this
offered substitution.<Node id="365054" /> <Node id="365055" />To play deity to an attractive young girl--there
was, for a moment he felt, a certain point to the idea.<Node id="365159" /> <Node id="365160" />But even as the
point pricked him ever so slightly he smiled to think of it, and the
consciousness of the prick passed from him.<Node id="365288" /> <Node id="365289" />His own belief in God was
still small, but his feeling for Organic Law was very strong, and his
dislike of any human being pretending to be above that Law was stronger
still.<Node id="365463" /> <Node id="365464" />The temptation rose and was lost in its absurdity.<Node id="365514" /> <Node id="365515" />And yet....<Node id="365526" />
<Node id="365527" />She looked up with an inviting smile.<Node id="365564" /> <Node id="365565" />He took her suddenly by one
shoulder with his hand.<Node id="365616" />

<Node id="365618" />'<Node id="365619" />You will not believe in me,' he answered, 'as more than a servant of
that which you serve.<Node id="365709" /> <Node id="365710" />Answer me--what is that?<Node id="365734" />'<Node id="365735" />

<Node id="365737" />'<Node id="365738" />It is nothing with which you have anything to do,' she said, 'unless
you will do also what I will.<Node id="365836" />'<Node id="365837" />

<Node id="365839" />He smiled at her in a sudden serenity.<Node id="365877" /> '<Node id="365879" />Now I know that I shall have my
way,' he said, either to her or to that which was within her, and added
to her alone, 'since it is impossible that we should be so separated for
ever.<Node id="366061" />'<Node id="366062" />

<Node id="366064" />'<Node id="366065" />You!<Node id="366069" />' <Node id="366071" />she said harshly, 'Will you govern me with your bit of filthy
pebble?<Node id="366140" />'<Node id="366141" />

<Node id="366143" />'<Node id="366144" />I have no need of the Stone,' he answered, still smiling at her, 'for
all that is in the Stone, except the accidents of time, is here between
us and perhaps more than is in the Stone.<Node id="366327" /> <Node id="366328" />And in that you will answer
me.<Node id="366359" /> <Node id="366360" />Tell me, child, what it is you serve.<Node id="366397" />'<Node id="366398" />

<Node id="366400" />She wrenched her shoulder away from him.<Node id="366440" /> '<Node id="366442" />Keep your beastly hands away,'
she cried.<Node id="366483" /> '<Node id="366485" />I am my own to keep and command.<Node id="366517" />'<Node id="366518" />

<Node id="366520" />'<Node id="366521" />And if that shall be true to-morrow,' Lord Arglay said, 'it is not true
now.<Node id="366597" />' <Node id="366599" />His voice took on a sternness and he looked on her with a high
disdain.<Node id="366670" /> '<Node id="366672" />Answer,' he said; 'will you make me wait?<Node id="366713" /> <Node id="366714" />Answer--what is it
that you serve?<Node id="366748" />'<Node id="366749" />

<Node id="366751" />She moved back a step or two, and suddenly he put out his hand, caught
her wrist, and pulled her back close to him; then, his eyes on hers, he
said: 'Child, you know me and I know you among the deceptions.<Node id="366956" /> <Node id="366957" />What is
it, what is it that you serve?<Node id="366995" />'<Node id="366996" />

<Node id="366998" />She gave a stifled cry, and slipped forward so that he caught her--'I
know,' she said, 'I know.<Node id="367093" /> <Node id="367094" />Hold me; I know.<Node id="367110" />'<Node id="367111" />

<Node id="367113" />When at last he moved she stood up and did something to her hair; then
she looked at him with a faint smile.<Node id="367221" /> '<Node id="367223" />I do know,' she said.<Node id="367244" />

<Node id="367246" />'<Node id="367247" />Then I think it is more than I do,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="367300" /> '<Node id="367302" />But that is very
possible.<Node id="367328" />'<Node id="367329" />

<Node id="367331" />'<Node id="367332" />Have I been saying anything--very silly?<Node id="367372" />' <Node id="367374" />she asked, picking up her
handbag and looking for her powder-puff.<Node id="367440" />

<Node id="367442" />The Chief Justice considered her.<Node id="367475" /> '<Node id="367477" />How do you feel?<Node id="367493" />' <Node id="367495" />he asked.<Node id="367504" /> '<Node id="367506" />Well
enough to talk a little about it?<Node id="367544" />'<Node id="367545" />

<Node id="367547" />'<Node id="367548" />Quite,' Chloe answered, sitting down, and adding after a moment's
pause, 'Have I been a nuisance?<Node id="367645" />'<Node id="367646" />

<Node id="367648" />'<Node id="367649" />Don't you remember?<Node id="367668" />' <Node id="367670" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="367688" /> '<Node id="367690" />Suppose you tell me
first--whatever seemed to happen.<Node id="367743" />'<Node id="367744" />

<Node id="367746" />'<Node id="367747" />I don't know that anything exactly happened,' Chloe said.<Node id="367804" /> '<Node id="367806" />I just began
to think about ...<Node id="367837" /> <Node id="367838" />began to think in a different way.<Node id="367872" />'<Node id="367873" />

<Node id="367875" />'<Node id="367876" />In _quite_ a different way?<Node id="367903" />' <Node id="367905" />Arglay interrupted.<Node id="367924" /> '<Node id="367926" />I mean, in a way you
had never thought before?<Node id="367972" />'<Node id="367973" />

<Node id="367975" />The colour flamed in Chloe's cheeks.<Node id="368011" /> <Node id="368012" />But she met his eyes and answered,
'Partly.<Node id="368055" /> <Node id="368056" />I don't think I ever _calculated_ before--not so much anyhow.<Node id="368117" />
<Node id="368118" />Or not at the same time that I felt ...<Node id="368157" />' <Node id="368159" />she struggled bravely on and
ended ...<Node id="368197" /> '<Node id="368199" />desirous.<Node id="368208" />'<Node id="368209" />

<Node id="368211" />The Chief Justice considered again.<Node id="368246" /> <Node id="368247" />He had seen the farewell she had
taken of Doncaster; he had observed, when he had returned to the study,
the valuation to which she was bringing its furniture; he had remarked
the cold intention in her eyes when the two of them were talking; and
he decided that in this case desire and calculation were two different
things.<Node id="368571" /> <Node id="368572" />But by what means, if by any outside herself, had they been
loosed?<Node id="368639" />

<Node id="368641" />'<Node id="368642" />It came on you suddenly?<Node id="368666" />' <Node id="368668" />he asked.<Node id="368677" />

<Node id="368679" />'<Node id="368680" />It came,' she answered, 'as if I thought I was walking down one road
and found I was walking down another.<Node id="368786" /> <Node id="368787" />It didn't even come; it was there.<Node id="368821" />
<Node id="368822" />I lived into the midst of it.<Node id="368851" />'<Node id="368852" />

<Node id="368854" />'<Node id="368855" />And it?<Node id="368862" />' <Node id="368864" />Arglay said, 'it seemed like some other self of yours?<Node id="368918" /> <Node id="368919" />Did you
know yourself in it?<Node id="368947" />'<Node id="368948" />

<Node id="368950" />'<Node id="368951" />In a way,' she answered, 'all the things that I have sometimes hated
most in myself.<Node id="369035" /> <Node id="369036" />But not altogether.<Node id="369055" /> <Node id="369056" />Never--no, in all my life, I never
wanted so utterly to grab without giving anything at all, never before.<Node id="369162" />'
<Node id="369164" />In her agitation she stood up.<Node id="369194" /> '<Node id="369196" />I'm not like that,' she said, 'O indeed
I'm not.<Node id="369244" />'<Node id="369245" />

<Node id="369247" />'<Node id="369248" />No,' Lord Arglay said, 'but I think I could guess who is, and whose
mind was thrust upon yours then.<Node id="369348" /> <Node id="369349" />But even he, even in the Stone, could
only affect you through your own habits and emotions.<Node id="369440" /> <Node id="369441" />So that both he
and you troubled and hid your heart.<Node id="369493" />' <Node id="369495" />He paused for a moment and went
on.<Node id="369530" /> '<Node id="369532" />Child, in those past times that you speak of, how have you governed
yourself?<Node id="369609" />'<Node id="369610" />

<Node id="369612" />'<Node id="369613" />By this and that,' Chloe said.<Node id="369643" /> '<Node id="369645" />By trying to think clearly and by
trying to be as nice as I could to people.<Node id="369721" />'<Node id="369722" />

<Node id="369724" />'<Node id="369725" />It is very well said,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="369769" /> '<Node id="369771" />I do not think Giles or
anyone else will easily overcome that guard of yours.<Node id="369848" />'<Node id="369849" />

<Node id="369851" />'<Node id="369852" />I will take care of that,' Chloe said in quite a different voice.<Node id="369917" /> '<Node id="369919" />I
shan't be caught twice.<Node id="369944" />'<Node id="369945" />

<Node id="369947" />'<Node id="369948" />Well,' Lord Arglay answered comfortably, looking round the room, 'I
mayn't be what Reginald's unfortunate American would call rich, but I
should think I am quite the most well-to-do person you know.<Node id="370146" /> <Node id="370147" />So if you
are going to make an attempt on anyone it will probably be on me again.<Node id="370228" />
<Node id="370229" />Which won't matter, will it?<Node id="370257" />'<Node id="370258" />

<Node id="370260" />'<Node id="370261" />No,' said Chloe, 'though it seems funny that it shouldn't.<Node id="370319" /> <Node id="370320" />And in a way
it does.<Node id="370341" />'<Node id="370342" />

<Node id="370344" />'<Node id="370345" />O la la!<Node id="370353" /> <Node id="370354" />in a way----' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="370385" /> '<Node id="370387" />But only in a way conformable
to the Stone.<Node id="370430" /> <Node id="370431" />Now it _is_ funny, if you like, how determined I was not
to use the Stone.<Node id="370505" /> <Node id="370506" />One might have thought I didn't care _what_ happened
to you.<Node id="370566" /> <Node id="370567" />I might have been the Hajji; indeed I was worse than the Hajji,
for he at least thought about using it.<Node id="370670" />'<Node id="370671" />

<Node id="370673" />'<Node id="370674" />Why--if I may--why didn't you?<Node id="370704" />' <Node id="370706" />Chloe asked shyly, but her eyes were
glad as she looked at him.<Node id="370769" />

<Node id="370771" />'<Node id="370772" />I couldn't see that it was going to be of the slightest use,' he
answered.<Node id="370846" /> '<Node id="370848" />It just wasn't there.<Node id="370869" /> <Node id="370870" />Or else--since we have decided to
believe in it--it was there anyhow, and to have it materially wouldn't
have helped.<Node id="370987" />'<Node id="370988" />

<Node id="370990" />'<Node id="370991" />Is there then something greater than the Stone?<Node id="371038" />' <Node id="371040" />she asked.<Node id="371050" /> '<Node id="371052" />I dreamed
last night that the King lifted up his hand and there was a great
light.<Node id="371134" />'<Node id="371135" />

<Node id="371137" />'<Node id="371138" />Also the Hajji spoke of a greater secret,' he answered.<Node id="371193" /> '<Node id="371195" />I do not think
Giles quite knows what he is doing.<Node id="371245" />'<Node id="371246" />

<Node id="371248" />'<Node id="371249" />Do you think it is dangerous to him?<Node id="371285" />' <Node id="371287" />Chloe said.<Node id="371298" />

<Node id="371300" />'<Node id="371301" />Anything that one uses is apt to become one's master,' Arglay answered.<Node id="371372" />
'<Node id="371374" />And if the Stone should become Giles's master--what would he find it to
be?<Node id="371449" />'<Node id="371450" />

<Node id="371452" />Chloe looked at her fingers.<Node id="371480" /> '<Node id="371482" />Do you think,' she said doubtfully, 'we
ought to try and ...<Node id="371542" /> <Node id="371543" />warn him or ...<Node id="371558" /> <Node id="371559" />help him ...<Node id="371571" /> <Node id="371572" />or anything?<Node id="371584" />'<Node id="371585" />

<Node id="371587" />'<Node id="371588" />Help him--help Giles?<Node id="371609" />' <Node id="371611" />Lord Arglay exclaimed.<Node id="371633" /> '<Node id="371635" />My dear child, don't
be absurd!<Node id="371666" /> <Node id="371667" />After he ...<Node id="371679" /> <Node id="371680" />O you're tired out; I shall take you home.<Node id="371722" />
<Node id="371723" />Unless--I ask you again--unless you'll stop here?<Node id="371772" />'<Node id="371773" />

<Node id="371775" />'<Node id="371776" />Not to-night, please,' she said.<Node id="371808" /> '<Node id="371810" />I shall be quite safe now.<Node id="371836" /> <Node id="371837" />If he
tries it again, I shall just _think_.<Node id="371880" />'<Node id="371881" />

<Node id="371883" />'<Node id="371884" />Do,' Lord Arglay approved.<Node id="371910" /> '<Node id="371912" />My present problem in _Organic Law_ is
this--Good heavens, you want to know!<Node id="371988" /> <Node id="371989" />O come along, you're merely making
altruism into a habit.<Node id="372046" />'<Node id="372047" />




<Node id="372052" />CHAPTER XIV<Node id="372063" />

<Node id="372065" />THE SECOND REFUSAL OF CHLOE BURNETT<Node id="372100" />


<Node id="372103" />Lord Arglay asserted later that whenever Chloe declared that she would
be quite safe something perilous was certain to be approaching.<Node id="372237" /> <Node id="372238" />But
since he knew that she was in possession of one of the Types and
therefore had at her disposal a means of escape from any crisis and a
place of refuge in his own house it did not seem to him that she was
likely to be in any unavoidable danger.<Node id="372485" /> <Node id="372486" />For alternatively if any one of
those who were bound to regard them as enemies should seize on the Type
she had, then his object would be achieved.<Node id="372633" /> <Node id="372634" />The Stone possessed, there
would be no point in harming Chloe; it would indeed be a stupid and
risky thing to do, arousing that very attention which it was important
to avoid.<Node id="372809" /> <Node id="372810" />It appeared therefore to the Chief Justice that though she
might be inconvenienced she could not be seriously endangered.<Node id="372931" />

<Node id="372933" />This argument, though sound within its limits, suffered from the
same trouble that invalidates all human argument and makes all human
conclusion erroneous, namely, that no reasoning can ever start from the
possession of all the facts.<Node id="373167" /> <Node id="373168" />The two facts which Lord Arglay's reasoning
left out of account were, first, the inclusion of the Prince Ali among
the pursuers of the Stone, and second Chloe's increasing determination
not to use her Type for her own safety.<Node id="373393" /> <Node id="373394" />It was this omission which
proved his conclusion wrong and did actually put her in peril.<Node id="373483" />

<Node id="373485" />For whatever the Persian Ambassador might diplomatically desire, and
whatever the Hajji Ibrahim might religiously assert, Ali had no
intention at all of relinquishing his efforts--if necessary, his
militant efforts--to recover all the Types if possible, and if not at
least one; by the possession of which he hoped to procure the rest.<Node id="373820" /> <Node id="373821" />His
first objective had been Sir Giles.<Node id="373860" /> <Node id="373861" />But Sir Giles had made it clear
that any attempt to recover the Type in his possession would mean a
multiplication of Stones which from Ali's point of view would be not
only sacrilegious but extremely troublesome.<Node id="374074" /> <Node id="374075" />He had not for some days
been at all clear where the rest of the Types were.<Node id="374151" /> <Node id="374152" />Reginald Montague
had apparently had one, but then--he gathered from the papers--so had
Sheldrake; were they one or two?<Node id="374272" /> <Node id="374273" />Ali could not, in his position, afford
to make a number of violent and unsuccessful efforts to recover it or
them; the Ambassador's modernity and the Hajji's piety might agree
in removing him to Moscow or having him recalled to Tehran before
he achieved what he wanted, should either of them suspect what was
happening.<Node id="374592" /> <Node id="374593" />He had not dared so far to make any effort to excite the
temper of the East.<Node id="374669" /> <Node id="374670" />But he had, with the greatest caution, sounded the
minds of one of his friends in the Embassy; he intended to gather about
himself a small group of similar spirits in order that when a convenient
time came he might, if necessary, strike in several directions at once.<Node id="374937" />

<Node id="374939" />Nothing however was further from his mind than that he should be rung
up by Sir Giles Tumulty.<Node id="375033" /> <Node id="375034" />It was not the first telephonic conversation
which had proceeded between the Embassy and the English that morning;
the Hajji and Lord Arglay had been talking earlier.<Node id="375200" /> <Node id="375201" />The Chief Justice
had briefly explained that all was well with Miss Burnett, and had added
that he was still in two minds about going off to Ealing and quite
simply killing Sir Giles.<Node id="375384" />

<Node id="375386" />'<Node id="375387" />What good do you think that would be ...<Node id="375427" /> <Node id="375428" />in the End?<Node id="375439" />' <Node id="375441" />the Hajji said.<Node id="375456" />

<Node id="375458" />'<Node id="375459" />I haven't an idea what good it would be in the End,' Lord Arglay
assured him, 'but it seems as if it might be a considerable good here
and now.<Node id="375602" /> <Node id="375603" />After all, we can't be expected to put everything off because
of the End or we should just be putting off the End itself.<Node id="375724" /> <Node id="375725" />At least it
seems so to me, but I'm no metaphysician.<Node id="375778" />'<Node id="375779" />

<Node id="375781" />'<Node id="375782" />What would Miss Burnett desire?<Node id="375813" />' <Node id="375815" />the Hajji asked.<Node id="375831" />

<Node id="375833" />'<Node id="375834" />That's my only difficulty,' Lord Arglay explained.<Node id="375884" /> '<Node id="375886" />I don't think she'd
like it--and yet I don't know.<Node id="375936" /> <Node id="375937" />Everybody else would be pleased.<Node id="375969" /> <Node id="375970" />I might
be hanged but I should be almost certain to have a memorial statue
somewhere, probably by Epstein.<Node id="376076" /> <Node id="376077" />I like Epstein too.<Node id="376096" /> <Node id="376097" />Well, I suppose I
shan't.<Node id="376122" />'<Node id="376123" />

<Node id="376125" />He might however have been almost inclined to turn the only
half-fantastic idea into an act if he had overheard Sir Giles a quarter
of an hour later.<Node id="376274" /> <Node id="376275" />The whole history of Tumulty's dealings with the Stone
had roused in him a state of increasing irritation with Lord Arglay and
his secretary.<Node id="376416" /> <Node id="376417" />There had been the spying on him, as he chose to call it,
at Birmingham; Arglay's refusal to investigate the half-hour's break;
the affray at the Conference; his own impotence to understand Arglay's
mind; the rescue of Pondon.<Node id="376643" /> <Node id="376644" />And now....<Node id="376655" /> <Node id="376656" />He was not very clear what
had interfered with his domination of Chloe.<Node id="376727" /> <Node id="376728" />He had, after the usual
preliminary attention and concentration, become aware of looking through
Chloe's eyes much as Arglay had looked through his own.<Node id="376880" /> <Node id="376881" />He had been
aware of a feeling for the Chief Justice which, since it certainly
wasn't his own, must be Chloe's.<Node id="376992" /> <Node id="376993" />He had attempted to turn that emotion
into his own desire to use Arglay and then throw him aside.<Node id="377090" /> <Node id="377091" />But he had
not reached to the extremer places of Chloe's own manner of experience;
it had been but her conscious thought that he could dominate, working
inwards from without.<Node id="377265" /> <Node id="377266" />He had so far conquered that his intention had
imposed itself on her as her own, although with the changed appearance
which, in their turn, her physical and mental desires had wrought in it.<Node id="377456" />
<Node id="377457" />But at the time when Lord Arglay had called upon his friend with the
authority to which she was accustomed and which she loved, Giles's will
had been swept aside.<Node id="377619" /> <Node id="377620" />A darkness fell upon him; he became aware of the
Stone in his hands, it seemed to move in them and itself to thrust him
back.<Node id="377745" /> <Node id="377746" />He dropped it suddenly as if just in time to avoid its growth
against him, and took, as he became again conscious of his outer
surroundings, a few angry steps about the room.<Node id="377920" /> '<Node id="377922" />I don't know if this
is a damned nightmare,' he grunted, 'but it felt as if I was going to
be swallowed by the bloody thing.<Node id="378046" /> <Node id="378047" />I wonder if I'm letting the idea
of getting back at Arglay and his whore run away with me.<Node id="378137" /> <Node id="378138" />One does,
sometimes; and that's just death to observation.<Node id="378196" /> <Node id="378197" />I wish there was
someone else who could tackle them.<Node id="378249" /> <Node id="378250" />And by God,' he exclaimed, 'there
is.<Node id="378287" /> <Node id="378288" />I suggested it to Birlesmere myself--there's the Persian.<Node id="378345" />'<Node id="378346" />

<Node id="378348" />As he thought about it he decided that this, in default of a better,
was the momentary solution.<Node id="378444" /> <Node id="378445" />The Prince Ali was probably still anxious to
recover the Stone, and if he happened to kill Chloe or Arglay in the
process so much the better.<Node id="378586" /> <Node id="378587" />Anyhow, even to lose their Types would
certainly annoy them, and if at the worst Ali or his friends failed or
suffered there was no particular harm done to Sir Giles himself.<Node id="378761" /> '<Node id="378763" />Ali
and this screaming peahen can fight it out together,' he said, and
looked up the number of the Persian Embassy.<Node id="378878" />

<Node id="378880" />The Prince was considerably surprised when he was first told that Sir
Giles Tumulty wanted to speak to him, but he condescended to answer.<Node id="379018" />

<Node id="379020" />Sir Giles was obscenely abrupt.<Node id="379051" /> <Node id="379052" />On condition that he was left alone he
would give the Persian a chance of recovering something, if Ali thought
it worth while.<Node id="379178" /> <Node id="379179" />Was he to be left alone?<Node id="379203" /> <Node id="379204" />The Prince, as abruptly,
agreed.<Node id="379236" /> <Node id="379237" />Then at Lancaster Gate and wherever the secretary hibernated,
were Types of the Stone, if they were wanted.<Node id="379344" />

<Node id="379346" />'<Node id="379347" />But why,' the Prince said curiously, 'do you tell me this?<Node id="379405" />'<Node id="379406" />

<Node id="379408" />'<Node id="379409" />What in hell's name does that matter to you?<Node id="379453" />' <Node id="379455" />Sir Giles asked.<Node id="379471" /> '<Node id="379473" />I gave
him one when I thought you were after me, just to make you and your
company of date-eaters think a bit.<Node id="379583" /> <Node id="379584" />But he annoys me, and I'd rather you
had it.<Node id="379628" />'<Node id="379629" />

<Node id="379631" />The Prince thought, but did not say, that the Foreign Office would
hardly have agreed.<Node id="379717" /> <Node id="379718" />Sir Giles had thought of it but he was far too angry
with his brother-in-law to care about all the Foreign Offices in Europe.<Node id="379843" />

<Node id="379845" />'<Node id="379846" />Well, there you are,' he said.<Node id="379876" /> '<Node id="379878" />I suppose you can hire somebody to do
the job.<Node id="379924" />'<Node id="379925" />

<Node id="379927" />'<Node id="379928" />That I will see to,' the Prince said.<Node id="379965" /> '<Node id="379967" />If this is true I cannot thank
you, but I will at least ignore you.<Node id="380034" />'<Node id="380035" />

<Node id="380037" />'<Node id="380038" />You'll do what?<Node id="380053" />' <Node id="380055" />Sir Giles almost yelled, but recovered himself and
slammed down the receiver.<Node id="380132" /> '<Node id="380134" />And I hope they assault the girl and
assassinate Arglay,' he thought to himself as he prepared to go out
again to Wandsworth.<Node id="380259" />

<Node id="380261" />The exact measures which the Prince took were, not unnaturally, never
explained.<Node id="380341" /> <Node id="380342" />But by the time that Chloe, after an uneventful day, returned
home, they had been carried out.<Node id="380436" /> <Node id="380437" />His friend had left London for Brighton
and Reginald Montague.<Node id="380499" /> <Node id="380500" />He himself was waiting for night.<Node id="380533" />

<Node id="380535" />Chloe and the Chief Justice had--quite seriously--discussed the
possibility of attempting to recover all the Types and of escaping with
them from England.<Node id="380689" /> <Node id="380690" />But neither of them, especially as they grew less and
less inclined to use it--or, as Chloe had said--to dictate to it, had
been quite prepared to take such extreme measures.<Node id="380864" /> <Node id="380865" />Lord Arglay viewed
with a certain hesitation the annexation of Sheldrake's Type, for which
after all he had paid and from which he was presumably entitled to get
such satisfaction as he legally could.<Node id="381065" /> <Node id="381066" />The Mayor of Rich had called to
ask the Chief Justice to draw up a public statement and petition on
behalf of all the sick, and on the first draft of this Lord Arglay, with
a wry smile, had spent some time.<Node id="381272" /> <Node id="381273" />Rich, he gathered from the papers, was
still in a state of simmering discontent.<Node id="381353" /> <Node id="381354" />Oliver Doncaster had called,
very uncertain of his behaviour in Chloe's company, and rather defeated
at finding that everything seemed normal.<Node id="381496" /> <Node id="381497" />No one alluded to her remark
of the previous night, and the Chief Justice being in the room all
the time there was no opportunity for him to make the running on the
strength of her own behaviour.<Node id="381692" /> <Node id="381693" />As, rather gloomily, he departed, Lord
Arglay looked at Chloe.<Node id="381755" /> '<Node id="381757" />Of course he doesn't appreciate Giles,' he
said.<Node id="381805" />

<Node id="381807" />'<Node id="381808" />But what must he think of _me_?<Node id="381839" />' <Node id="381841" />Chloe asked despairingly.<Node id="381866" />

<Node id="381868" />'<Node id="381869" />I can't begin to imagine,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="381913" /> '<Node id="381915" />Nor as a matter of
fact can he.<Node id="381946" /> <Node id="381947" />You can, but you needn't at the moment.<Node id="381986" /> <Node id="381987" />For I am utterly
convinced that Austin--Austin!<Node id="382034" />--<Node id="382036" />never said '_Attribuat igitur rex legi,
quod lex attribuit ei, videlicet dominationem et potestatem.<Node id="382136" /> <Node id="382137" />Non est
enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas et non lex.<Node id="382188" />_' <Node id="382191" />Don't you know the sound
of Bracton's voice, when you hear it?<Node id="382253" /> "<Node id="382255" />Therefore let the king attribute
to the law that which the law attributes to him, namely, domination and
power.<Node id="382366" /> <Node id="382367" />For where the will rules and not the law is no king.<Node id="382419" />" <Node id="382421" />You haven't
checked your references, child, and, as a result, you've got this whole
page of quotations wrong.<Node id="382530" />'<Node id="382531" />

<Node id="382533" />Chloe bit her lips, crossed out the attribution, and plunged back into
legal histories.<Node id="382620" />

<Node id="382622" />This unfortunate lapse, the more maddening that it had been a page she
had written out some weeks earlier, and before the Stone had preoccupied
her mind, was annoying her when she returned that night.<Node id="382822" /> <Node id="382823" />For she had
rather prided herself on her secretarial efficiency, and Lord Arglay's
quite pleasant, but quite firm, criticism of it distressed almost as
much as it pleased her.<Node id="382998" /> <Node id="382999" />Almost, because she thought as she took off her
hat how much worse it would have been if he had pretended that, because
of their friendship, it didn't matter.<Node id="383157" /> '<Node id="383159" />It was,' he had said, 'no doubt
the prophetic soul of your wide world dreaming on things to come.<Node id="383256" /> <Node id="383257" />But
don't let it be dreaming too much about the law-makers who are gone,
will you?<Node id="383339" /> <Node id="383340" />Or let us be quite clear when it is.<Node id="383376" />' <Node id="383378" />Chloe kicked herself
again and made some coffee.<Node id="383426" />

<Node id="383428" />The incident however sent her to bed even more certain of the edge of
incapacity and void upon which she dwelt than she normally was.<Node id="383561" /> <Node id="383562" />What
with Frank Lindsay being angry with her for one thing (and even now she
wasn't clear that she had been right), and Lord Arglay being critical of
her for another (and she was quite clear that she had been hopelessly
careless), she seemed to herself a sufficiently ineffectual creature.<Node id="383851" /> <Node id="383852" />It
was true she couldn't much care whether Frank was angry or not, and
didn't in a sense mind whether Lord Arglay was displeased or not; if the
one didn't understand, well, she couldn't help it, and of the other she
would always be secure no matter how unhappy he might, very properly and
rightly, make her.<Node id="384159" /> <Node id="384160" />Still, if this was the result of her emotional and
intellectual life--merely to annoy everybody!<Node id="384256" /> <Node id="384257" />She looked at herself in
the glass and wondered as on several other occasions during the last few
days what the Hajji had meant by saying that the Name was upon her
forehead.<Node id="384431" /> <Node id="384432" />The Name of the God in which she and Lord Arglay had decided
to believe?<Node id="384504" /> <Node id="384505" />What did you do if you had decided to believe in God?<Node id="384558" /> <Node id="384559" />So far
as her early training served her, she thought you gave up your will to
His.<Node id="384641" /> _<Node id="384643" />Non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas_--for where the will rules
there is no king.<Node id="384727" /> <Node id="384728" />But Bracton--damn her stupidity!<Node id="384760" />--<Node id="384762" />had been talking of
feudal law, and yet....<Node id="384805" /> <Node id="384806" />She wandered slowly back and lifted from her
handbag the Type of the Stone that she carried, to lay it under her
pillow for the night.<Node id="384940" /> '<Node id="384942" />The End of Desire' ...<Node id="384964" /> '<Node id="384966" />the Stone which is
between you and me.<Node id="385004" />' <Node id="385006" />You gave up your will, did you?<Node id="385037" /> <Node id="385038" />Your will by itself
produced pretty poor results, it seemed.<Node id="385098" /> _<Node id="385100" />Attribuat igitur_--let the
king attribute to the law ...<Node id="385156" /> <Node id="385157" />But how to find the law?<Node id="385181" /> '<Node id="385183" />The Way to the
Stone which is in the Stone.<Node id="385226" />' <Node id="385228" />The Stone, Lord Arglay, God--the End of
Desire.<Node id="385275" /> <Node id="385276" />Was this then what her absurd childish prayers meant?<Node id="385329" /> '<Node id="385331" />Our
Father which art in heaven,' she thought, 'Hallowed be Thy name, Thy
kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven'--and what
did that mean?<Node id="385488" /> <Node id="385489" />Of course if it all did mean something it was quite easy
to believe she hadn't yet understood, but in that case she wanted, she
wanted very much, to understand; and very much indeed, with her body and
mind and everything else, she desired the End of Desire.<Node id="385746" /> <Node id="385747" />Still thinking
about it, still trying over to herself the first few phrases of that
august ritual of intercession she got into bed, laid the Type of the
Stone under her pillow, and settled herself to sleep.<Node id="385953" />

<Node id="385955" />Or to think.<Node id="385967" /> <Node id="385968" />But bed, as Chloe had on other occasions discovered, is
not really a good place in which to try and do both, even sequentially.<Node id="386095" />
<Node id="386096" />When she decided that she had thought enough and ought to go to
sleep, for fear the next day should find her making a muddle of more
quotations, she found it was too late.<Node id="386267" /> <Node id="386268" />Bits of her previous thoughts
half imaged themselves to her, and disappeared before she could do
more than recognize them.<Node id="386390" /> <Node id="386391" />She thought of getting up and reading, but
she couldn't think of any book in her rooms which she wanted to
read--not even Mr. Ford Madox Ford's novels or the life of Sir Edward
Marshall-Hall (which, a fortnight before, had seemed to her to unite law
and interest--Chloe had never quite freed herself from the idea that she
ought to read in her leisure something that had a bearing on her work).<Node id="386785" />
<Node id="386786" />And anyhow----<Node id="386800" />

<Node id="386802" />She lay very still suddenly.<Node id="386830" /> <Node id="386831" />Something, surely something, had sounded.<Node id="386872" />
<Node id="386873" />Only the door-handle.<Node id="386894" /> <Node id="386895" />But it had, ever so faintly, clicked.<Node id="386932" /> <Node id="386933" />Doors
did make noises in the night--but door-handles?<Node id="386986" /> <Node id="386987" />She felt hastily
round to see if she could remember a door-handle clicking.<Node id="387062" /> <Node id="387063" />Was there
somebody--had somebody come for the Stone?<Node id="387115" /> <Node id="387116" />She thrust both hands under
her pillow in a panic, and her fingers closed about it.<Node id="387199" /> <Node id="387200" />The moonlight
came half across the room, alongside her bed; surely no one at least
could reach its--and her--head, and the Stone, unseen.<Node id="387337" /> <Node id="387338" />She began to
strain her eyes towards the foot; then she shut them, in case there was
anyone, and that she might be thought asleep; then she partly opened
them that she might see what was happening.<Node id="387535" /> <Node id="387536" />There was a faint movement
somewhere, as if of a breath being loosed, then another silence.<Node id="387627" /> <Node id="387628" />Chloe's
right hand grasped the Stone; her left held the bed-clothes tightly.<Node id="387704" />
<Node id="387705" />What, what, if there was anyone there, was she to do?<Node id="387758" /> <Node id="387759" />O for Lord Arglay
now!<Node id="387781" />

<Node id="387783" />She remembered suddenly, still desperately watching, what he had said,
'Come to me'--yes, but how was she to come?<Node id="387897" /> <Node id="387898" />O why wouldn't he come to
her?<Node id="387928" /> '<Node id="387930" />Come to me.<Node id="387941" />' <Node id="387943" />But how--but of course the Stone.<Node id="387976" /> <Node id="387977" />She only had to
make use of the Stone and all would be safe.<Node id="388037" /> <Node id="388038" />In the thrill of assured
safety she all but made a face at the unknown, if there were an unknown.<Node id="388135" />
<Node id="388136" />And there was; for one second on the edge of the dark an edge of a
finger showed.<Node id="388217" /> <Node id="388218" />Something was moving towards her in the night.<Node id="388264" /> <Node id="388265" />Well, that
was all right; they could go on moving.<Node id="388315" /> <Node id="388316" />She had only to will and----She
had only to will ...<Node id="388368" /> <Node id="388369" />to use the Stone.<Node id="388386" /> <Node id="388387" />In a horror of anguish she
understood the choice that was presented to her.<Node id="388462" />

<Node id="388464" />Her thoughts went through her head like Niagara.<Node id="388512" /> <Node id="388513" />Lord Arglay had told
her but even Lord Arglay didn't feel like that about the Stone and she
had said to Frank she wouldn't use it if she were starving and what was
the man doing and what would he do if she screamed and even if she did
perhaps Mrs. Webb wouldn't come down this time and what could she do if
she did?<Node id="388828" /> <Node id="388829" />O it wasn't fair, it wasn't fair!<Node id="388862" /> <Node id="388863" />How could she use the Stone?<Node id="388891" />
<Node id="388892" />yet how could she bear not to if whoever it was came nearer?<Node id="388952" /> <Node id="388953" />He was
probably trying to see if her hands were empty; well, they weren't.<Node id="389027" /> <Node id="389028" />He
won't know if I've got it in my hand or not, she thought.<Node id="389088" /> <Node id="389089" />Could she sit
up, switch on the light, and with the Stone in her hand dare him to
move?<Node id="389176" /> <Node id="389177" />No--it was too risky; he'd think of something she wasn't prepared
for and perhaps snatch it from her.<Node id="389278" /> <Node id="389279" />Then she would use it; after all she
was using it to save it.<Node id="389340" /> <Node id="389341" />She was doing for it what it could not do for
itself.<Node id="389394" /> <Node id="389395" />She was protecting it.<Node id="389417" /> <Node id="389418" />Not being a reader of religious history
Chloe was ignorant what things have been done in the strength of that
plea, or with what passionate anxiety men have struggled to protect
the subordination of Omnipotence.<Node id="389629" /> <Node id="389630" />But in her despair she rejected what
churches and kings and prelates have not rejected; she refused to be
deceived, she refused to attempt to be helpful to the God, and being in
an agony she prayed more earnestly.<Node id="389843" /> <Node id="389844" />The God purged her as she writhed;
lucidity entered into her; she turned upon her face, and with both
hands beneath her pillow holding the Stone, she lay still, saying only
silently in her panting breath: 'Thy will, ...<Node id="390063" /> <Node id="390064" />do ...<Node id="390070" /> <Node id="390071" />do if Thou wilt;
or'--she imagined the touch of the marauder on the calf of her leg and
quivering in every nerve added--'or ...<Node id="390198" /> <Node id="390199" />not.<Node id="390203" />'<Node id="390204" />

<Node id="390206" />In the darkness the Prince Ali almost made a movement of delight.<Node id="390271" />
<Node id="390272" />He had got into the house, by the aid of certain hangers-on of the
hangers-on of the Embassy; secret service, from which even a minor
Embassy is not entirely exempt, sets up connexions which are useful at
times, and judicious inquiries that afternoon by a gentleman in search
of lodgings had let him know which Chloe's room was.<Node id="390600" /> <Node id="390601" />The actual seizure
of the Stone he had not dared to entrust to anyone else, but he had been
disturbed to find Chloe still awake.<Node id="390729" /> <Node id="390730" />He had reckoned on sleep, darkness,
and chloroform, but he had not dared cross the moonlight while she lay
awake, for he had some idea of how swiftly the Stone would work and he
had no wish to be confronted with an empty bed.<Node id="390955" /> <Node id="390956" />Now that she had turned
on to her face, however, his opportunity was at hand.<Node id="391033" /> <Node id="391034" />He felt very
carefully for the chloroformed pad, and at that moment a cloud began
gradually to obscure the moonlight.<Node id="391151" /> <Node id="391152" />The Prince hesitated and determined
to wait for that fuller darkness; while he waited he took out his
electric torch with his left hand, and rehearsed his movements.<Node id="391317" /> <Node id="391318" />A few
quiet steps to the top of the bed, the torchlight on her head, the pad
over her mouth.<Node id="391410" /> <Node id="391411" />He was practically certain that the Stone would be under
her pillow--or perhaps in a bag round her neck; at any rate once she was
unconscious he would be able to search at leisure, with the room light
on.<Node id="391615" /> <Node id="391616" />It would, he felt, have been more satisfactory to his outraged creed
to destroy the woman who had done dishonour to the sacred thing even by
possessing it, and to avenge upon her the insult offered to his God.<Node id="391825" /> <Node id="391826" />But
this relief he could hardly allow himself; Allah himself must punish.<Node id="391899" />
<Node id="391900" />The moonlight had disappeared; the room lay in darkness, he stepped
forward, his finger on the switch of the torch.<Node id="392015" />

<Node id="392017" />When Chloe had heaved herself round with that last movement her heart
had been beating wildly, and her breath coming in quick pants.<Node id="392149" /> <Node id="392150" />Now as
she lay she felt both of them beginning to move more quietly and more
largely; she drew long and deep breaths and her heart composed itself to
a corresponding rhythm.<Node id="392323" /> <Node id="392324" />She still saw before her mental vision the edge
of a finger against a darkness, or rather not now the edge but the
finger itself, and at its back an indeterminate shape as if it were
thrust a little forward from the whole hand; and she realized that
it was not the same finger which she had seen a few moments earlier.<Node id="392642" />
<Node id="392643" />Between these two palenesses therefore she lay, the one remembered, the
other beheld, yet both present, and, almost as if in the uncertainty
before sleep, she was vaguely conscious that the two came together and
formed one stream of pale but increasing light.<Node id="392902" /> <Node id="392903" />From somewhere beyond
her, where her hands clasped the Stone, that narrow line of light
emerged; she lay within it and it passed through and about her without
hindrance.<Node id="393072" /> <Node id="393073" />The more clear it grew to her knowledge, the more clearly
within she enunciated the formula she had shaped with such pain and at
last unconsciously abandoned the formula itself for the meaning that lay
within it.<Node id="393285" />

<Node id="393287" />'<Node id="393288" />Do, or do not,' she silently uttered, and fell even mentally into
stillness in order that unhindered that action might or might not take
place.<Node id="393431" /> <Node id="393432" />The light grew suddenly around her; some encumbrance for a moment
touched her mouth and would have interrupted her appeal, had it been
vocal; a vibration went through her, as if a note of music had been
struck along her whole frame, and far off she heard as it were a single
trumpet at the gate of the house of Suleiman with a prolonged blast
saluting the dawn.<Node id="393793" />

<Node id="393795" />The police-constable on his beat outside had come slowly down the road,
and from a few yards off saw a dark heap at the door of Mrs. Webb's
house.<Node id="393941" /> <Node id="393942" />He broke into a run, bent over it for a minute, then straightened
himself, and blew his whistle.<Node id="394038" /> <Node id="394039" />It was the body of a man that lay there;
they found afterwards that it was burnt as if by lightning and broken as
if cast from an immense distance.<Node id="394186" /> <Node id="394187" />The constable's whistle sounded again
as if with a prolonged blast saluting the dawn.<Node id="394272" />




<Node id="394277" />CHAPTER XV<Node id="394287" />

<Node id="394289" />THE POSSESSIVENESS OF MR.<Node id="394314" /> <Node id="394315" />FRANK LINDSAY<Node id="394328" />


<Node id="394331" />Neither Mrs. Webb nor Miss Burnett were of much use to the police in
that morning investigation.<Node id="394427" /> <Node id="394428" />Neither of them recognized the body, and
though it had lain huddled against the front door of the house, there
was nothing to show that, alive or dead, it had ever been inside the
door.<Node id="394613" /> <Node id="394614" />Besides which, burning and breaking, as that body was burnt and
broken, are not injuries which the two women seemed very capable of
inflicting, and the inspector in charge leaned to the idea that it
had been brought from a distance and dropped at this spot.<Node id="394871" /> <Node id="394872" />The usual
inquiries were set on foot, with a casual jest or two about the
possibility of the Rich Stone being responsible.<Node id="394994" /> <Node id="394995" />But Miss Burnett
was not prevented from departing to her employment, though some care
was taken to see that she actually went to Lord Arglay's as she had
professed to intend; since with these modern girls, as someone remarked,
you never knew.<Node id="395237" /> <Node id="395238" />The police had cause to be glad that they had not
interfered, since in quite a short time the Home Office was intimating
to them that the whole incident had better be kept as quiet as possible,
and the stop-press paragraph which, by the chance of a belated journalist,
had appeared in one morning paper had better be left without any sequel.<Node id="395579" />

<Node id="395581" />The Chief Justice had listened in silence to Chloe's account of the
night.<Node id="395655" />

<Node id="395657" />'<Node id="395658" />And that blast of sound went on,' she ended, 'and it seemed to be a
long time before I understood it was just a police whistle, and all that
light was just the moon.<Node id="395823" /> <Node id="395824" />And then I knew that whatever it was had gone
away; so I got up and looked out of the window.<Node id="395917" /> <Node id="395918" />And there they were.<Node id="395938" />'<Node id="395939" />

<Node id="395941" />'<Node id="395942" />The police?<Node id="395953" />'<Node id="395954" />

<Node id="395956" />'<Node id="395957" />The police.<Node id="395968" /> <Node id="395969" />They saw me and I asked a question or two, and they asked
more--of Mrs. Webb too.<Node id="396050" /> <Node id="396051" />But they couldn't do anything to us.<Node id="396087" /> <Node id="396088" />I don't
even know whether ...<Node id="396117" /> <Node id="396118" />what they had was what I saw.<Node id="396147" />'<Node id="396148" />

<Node id="396150" />'<Node id="396151" />It may not have been,' Arglay said, 'But I think it is likely.<Node id="396213" /> <Node id="396214" />Did you
see the ...<Node id="396233" /> <Node id="396234" />the result?<Node id="396245" />'<Node id="396246" />

<Node id="396248" />'<Node id="396249" />Yes,' Chloe said, her face white but rather with awe than horror or
fear, 'it was as if it had been struck by lightning.<Node id="396369" />'<Node id="396370" />

<Node id="396372" />'<Node id="396373" />It wasn't Giles?<Node id="396389" />'<Node id="396390" />

<Node id="396392" />'<Node id="396393" />It was someone I have never seen before,' Chloe answered.<Node id="396450" /> '<Node id="396452" />A dark man,
a foreigner I think.<Node id="396484" /> <Node id="396485" />Not a negro but someone Eastern.<Node id="396517" />'<Node id="396518" />

<Node id="396520" />'<Node id="396521" />As a Persian, for instance?<Node id="396548" />' <Node id="396550" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="396568" /> '<Node id="396570" />Though how they knew
of you I don't understand.<Node id="396617" /> <Node id="396618" />Well, we can ask the Hajji if he knows
anything--I don't think he'd be in it.<Node id="396695" /> <Node id="396696" />He seems to have too low an
opinion of violence and too high an opinion of you.<Node id="396775" />'<Node id="396776" />

<Node id="396778" />Chloe looked at her feet and said nothing, and in a moment the Chief
Justice went on.<Node id="396863" /> '<Node id="396865" />Yes, we will talk to him, and also I will speak to
Bruce Cumberland.<Node id="396933" /> <Node id="396934" />He won't want the thing broadcast, if it is the
Persians, and it may save you some trouble.<Node id="397025" /> <Node id="397026" />At any rate, you will sleep
here now.<Node id="397063" />'<Node id="397064" />

<Node id="397066" />'<Node id="397067" />Yes,' Chloe said simply, 'I will.<Node id="397100" /> <Node id="397101" />Shall I send a note to Mrs. Webb
explaining?<Node id="397145" />'<Node id="397146" />

<Node id="397148" />'<Node id="397149" />Do,' Arglay said, 'while I telephone.<Node id="397186" />'<Node id="397187" />

<Node id="397189" />Mr.<Node id="397192" /> <Node id="397193" />Bruce Cumberland, when he heard the news, took the steps he
was expected to take.<Node id="397274" /> <Node id="397275" />The police were warned to be careful in their
inquiries, and to turn those inquiries to discovering whether any member
of the Persian Embassy was missing.<Node id="397429" /> <Node id="397430" />But before Lord Arglay had finished
talking to the Hajji a caller arrived at Lancaster Gate.<Node id="397522" />

<Node id="397524" />Mr.<Node id="397527" /> <Node id="397528" />Frank Lindsay had seen the newspaper paragraph, and alone among its
readers had known the street for Chloe's.<Node id="397637" /> <Node id="397638" />He did not seriously connect
her with 'the dead body of a man found early that morning,' but there
flashed through his mind the notion that here was an opportunity for an
anxious inquiry.<Node id="397825" /> <Node id="397826" />Within that opportunity another possibility lay curled,
vivid with a delectable poison.<Node id="397913" /> <Node id="397914" />Sometimes with, sometimes without, his
own consent, Merridew's proposal had demanded consideration, each time
more urgently, each time more plausibly.<Node id="398064" /> <Node id="398065" />But however reasonable it had
begun to seem, since after all it would do Chloe no harm and himself a
great deal of good, he could not discover how to carry it out without
a depressing sacrifice of his own proper pride.<Node id="398283" /> <Node id="398284" />She had refused his
suggestion almost--no, quite--rudely; she had dismissed him; she
had promised to write and had not written.<Node id="398411" /> <Node id="398412" />Even for the sake of his
examination and (what of course did not weigh with him) the fee Merridew
had spoken of--for a fee, nothing more, was what it was--even for
these things Lindsay could not see how to make any movement towards a
reconciliation.<Node id="398661" /> <Node id="398662" />But every day made the need of that reconciliation more
urgent, if it was to be in time to be any use, if (he said to himself)
they were to be on their old terms again, and hardly knew that by the
phrase he meant very new terms indeed.<Node id="398897" /> <Node id="398898" />It was not that Chloe would bear
any malice, but that swift willingness of hers to hurry all occasion of
mischief into oblivion at times rather annoyed him; it seemed a little
undignified, and was one of the things in which he suspected the
influence of Lord Arglay encouraged her in lessening herself.<Node id="399200" /> <Node id="399201" />Of
course, it was different when he was concerned, though even then it
was difficult for him to be gracious when she so speedily abolished
the opportunity for grace.<Node id="399366" /> <Node id="399367" />She ran where he walked, and he thought
walking the more handsome movement.<Node id="399442" /> <Node id="399443" />But now--with a dead body in the
street--yes, a real concern was permissible.<Node id="399520" /> <Node id="399521" />And if that concern repaid
its possessor in other ways--but he was not thinking of that, he was
thinking of a dead body.<Node id="399641" /> <Node id="399642" />He was perfectly correct, but a more accurate
vision would have told him that he was thinking also of a dying soul,
and that his own.<Node id="399775" />

<Node id="399777" />She would be at Lancaster Gate, and to Lancaster Gate, rather nervously,
he went.<Node id="399858" /> <Node id="399859" />The telephone seemed inadequate to his anxiety; an actual
meeting, a clasping hand, a reassuring embrace, if possible, if the
Chief Justice was out of the way, seemed to be demanded.<Node id="400041" /> <Node id="400042" />From every
point of view he hoped that Lord Arglay would be out of the way.<Node id="400117" />

<Node id="400119" />Lord Arglay, seeing the maid speak to Chloe and seeing also Chloe's
glance at himself, cut short his conversation with the Hajji, and,
hearing that Mr. Lindsay had called, took immediate steps to be out of
the way.<Node id="400333" /> '<Node id="400335" />You can call me for a minute when he's going,' he said, 'if
you think it would look more courteous.<Node id="400434" /> <Node id="400435" />But do as you like about that.<Node id="400465" />
<Node id="400466" />The Hajji won't be here just yet.<Node id="400499" />'<Node id="400500" />

<Node id="400502" />'<Node id="400503" />But I don't know that I want you to go,' Chloe said uncertainly.<Node id="400567" /> '<Node id="400569" />No,
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put it like that.<Node id="400618" /> <Node id="400619" />I didn't mean to talk as
if I had a right....<Node id="400664" />'<Node id="400665" />

<Node id="400667" />'<Node id="400668" />I feel,' Lord Arglay said, 'that God--it's curious how easily one
accepts the idea; atavism, I suppose--would rather I went; at least, the
God in your friend.<Node id="400826" /> <Node id="400827" />There is courtesy everywhere, and this, so to speak,
is that.<Node id="400888" /> <Node id="400889" />Besides, now I know you're safe, I should like him to.<Node id="400943" />'<Node id="400944" />

<Node id="400946" />Chloe did her amiable best to reassure Mr. Lindsay, but she felt all
the time that she couldn't much mind whether he were reassured or not.<Node id="401085" />
<Node id="401086" />Unless indeed he had undergone a conversion of which she would not look
for the signs for fear they should not be there.<Node id="401206" /> <Node id="401207" />She said nothing about
the invasion of the night and at first took great care not to mention
the Stone.<Node id="401310" /> <Node id="401311" />Yet since it was so much in her thoughts she did find herself
wishing that he, so young, so ignorant, so well-intentioned, as he
seemed to her, could feel as she felt about it, or could at least see
what she felt, and when after about a quarter of an hour she felt that
he might as well go, she said hesitatingly: 'You do understand, Frank,
about the other night, don't you?<Node id="401685" />'<Node id="401686" />

<Node id="401688" />Frank, whose inner thoughts had also been occupied with the Stone, said
brightly: 'O of course, of course.<Node id="401794" /> <Node id="401795" />Don't worry; that's quite all right.<Node id="401831" />
<Node id="401832" />I see what you meant,' and wondered, for the fifteenth time, whether she
had brought it with her or left it at Highgate.<Node id="401952" /> <Node id="401953" />It wasn't on any of the
tables, but her handbag lay by the typewriter; could it be----<Node id="402039" />

<Node id="402041" />'<Node id="402042" />Would you like just to speak to Lord Arglay?<Node id="402086" />' <Node id="402088" />Chloe said.<Node id="402099" />

<Node id="402101" />That meant that she was expecting him to go, he thought very swiftly; if
he said yes would she leave the room?<Node id="402211" /> <Node id="402212" />or would she send a maid?<Node id="402237" /> <Node id="402238" />It was
growing urgent, this need of the Stone, though, of course, he could
perhaps take her home.<Node id="402335" /> <Node id="402336" />But where did she keep it?<Node id="402362" /> <Node id="402363" />Suppose she had it
round her neck in a bag?<Node id="402406" /> <Node id="402407" />Girls did; and then----Even his mind refused
to contemplate what measures, and in them what treachery, might be
necessary: after all, they had been friends.<Node id="402563" /> '<Node id="402565" />Yes' then, and pray heaven
she went to tell Lord Arglay herself.<Node id="402629" />

<Node id="402631" />'<Node id="402632" />Perhaps it would be better,' he said.<Node id="402669" />

<Node id="402671" />She kissed him--persevering upon the Way--pressed his hand, went to
the door, threw him a last smile, and disappeared.<Node id="402789" /> <Node id="402790" />And he, swiftly and
quietly, his eyes on the closed door, moved to her work-table, opened
the bag, felt the Stone, withdrew it, stared at it, slipped it into his
trouser pocket, where he thought among his keys and money it would be
least noticeable, re-fastened the bag, and almost ran to the window.<Node id="403090" />
<Node id="403091" />And even then there were two or three minutes given him for repentance,
before Chloe opened the door for the Chief Justice, and stepped softly
aside, as a secretary should, that her employer might enter.<Node id="403294" /> <Node id="403295" />This
careful subordination had always pleased Lord Arglay, and after the
occurrences of the last few days gave him an increasing joy, as if it
were part of the habitual ritual that surrounded his office, but much
more delightful, more dear, and in some way more important than the
rest.<Node id="403581" />

<Node id="403583" />Lord Arglay shook hands.<Node id="403607" /> <Node id="403608" />Mr. Lindsay, a trifle awkwardly, apologized
for disturbing Miss Burnett at her work.<Node id="403692" /> <Node id="403693" />Lord Arglay said that any
friend of Miss Burnett's was free at all times to disturb her in her
work, which owing to her sense of form was rapidly becoming a great deal
more her work than it was his.<Node id="403891" /> <Node id="403892" />Mr. Lindsay said that the paragraph in
the paper had alarmed him; he had been afraid there might have been some
disturbance in the street, or even that some attack....<Node id="404059" /> <Node id="404060" />Lord Arglay said
that he had feared the same thing and had been very anxious until Miss
Burnett arrived.<Node id="404164" /> <Node id="404165" />Mr. Lindsay was greatly indebted to Lord Arglay.<Node id="404213" /> <Node id="404214" />Lord
Arglay hoped that Mr. Lindsay would believe that their common friendship
with Miss Burnett put his own house at Mr. Lindsay's disposal at
such--or any--times.<Node id="404377" /> <Node id="404378" />The maid announced Mr. Ibrahim.<Node id="404409" /> <Node id="404410" />Mr. Lindsay was
again obliged and must go.<Node id="404452" /> <Node id="404453" />Lord Arglay regretted, understood, and
parted.<Node id="404499" /> <Node id="404500" />The maid showed Mr. Lindsay out.<Node id="404532" />

<Node id="404534" />With his departure the three in the study seemed to enter into a common
concern.<Node id="404614" /> <Node id="404615" />The Hajji, as the sound of the front door closing was heard,
said quite simply: 'It was Ali.<Node id="404707" />'<Node id="404708" />

<Node id="404710" />'<Node id="404711" />That is your nephew?<Node id="404731" />' <Node id="404733" />Lord Arglay said.<Node id="404750" />

<Node id="404752" />'<Node id="404753" />He was my nephew,' the Hajji answered, 'but more than death has
separated us.<Node id="404830" /> <Node id="404831" />For he also has wished to lay violent hands upon the
Stone.<Node id="404890" />'<Node id="404891" />

<Node id="404893" />Lord Arglay said, as he motioned to them to be seated, 'Hajji, the whole
world seems to agree with him there.<Node id="405002" />'<Node id="405003" />

<Node id="405005" />'<Node id="405006" />It is the worse for all of us,' the Hajji answered sadly.<Node id="405063" />

<Node id="405065" />'<Node id="405066" />You are sure of this?<Node id="405087" />' <Node id="405089" />Arglay asked, as he too sat down.<Node id="405122" />

<Node id="405124" />'<Node id="405125" />As sure as I can be without seeing him,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="405179" /> '<Node id="405181" />He is not at
the Embassy this morning, none knows where he has gone, and I know what
he unwisely desired.<Node id="405286" />'<Node id="405287" />

<Node id="405289" />'<Node id="405290" />I am very sorry for your house,' Lord Arglay said, 'for this is
becoming a very terrible thing.<Node id="405385" /> <Node id="405386" />But because of others will you tell us
what you think happened last night?<Node id="405460" /> <Node id="405461" />Why did this man die?<Node id="405482" />'<Node id="405483" />

<Node id="405485" />The Hajji looked at Chloe.<Node id="405511" /> '<Node id="405513" />Tell me,' he said, 'what you did when you
knew that someone was in your room.<Node id="405590" />'<Node id="405591" />

<Node id="405593" />Chloe tried to express it.<Node id="405619" /> '<Node id="405621" />I didn't think I ought to use the Stone for
myself,' she said, 'and I didn't think I knew what it willed for itself,
so I--I did nothing except hope that it would--deal with things.<Node id="405802" />'<Node id="405803" />

<Node id="405805" />'<Node id="405806" />Of itself?<Node id="405816" />' <Node id="405818" />the Hajji asked softly.<Node id="405841" />

<Node id="405843" />'<Node id="405844" />I suppose so,' Chloe admitted.<Node id="405874" /> '<Node id="405876" />I didn't know what I ought to do.<Node id="405909" />'<Node id="405910" />

<Node id="405912" />The Hajji nodded slowly, and looked at Lord Arglay.<Node id="405963" /> '<Node id="405965" />It should be clear
to you what has come about,' he said.<Node id="406021" /> '<Node id="406023" />A thing has happened which has
not been possible for a thousand years.<Node id="406093" />'<Node id="406094" />

<Node id="406096" />'<Node id="406097" />I can quite believe that,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="406141" /> '<Node id="406143" />A thousand years seem to
be considerably less than a day in this case.<Node id="406213" /> <Node id="406214" />But I am not at all clear
what this thing is.<Node id="406259" />'<Node id="406260" />

<Node id="406262" />'<Node id="406263" />This Holy Thing has been kept in seclusion,' Ibrahim answered,
'through many centuries, and in all that time none of its keepers have
approached or touched it.<Node id="406422" /> <Node id="406423" />And since Giles Tumulty stole it men have
grasped at it in their own wisdom.<Node id="406499" /> <Node id="406500" />But this woman has put her will at
its disposal, and between it and her the union may be achieved by which
the other Hiddenness is made manifest.<Node id="406645" />'<Node id="406646" />

<Node id="406648" />'<Node id="406649" />What is the other Hiddenness?<Node id="406678" />' <Node id="406680" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="406698" />

<Node id="406700" />The Hajji hesitated, then he turned his eyes back to Chloe and seemed to
ask a question of her.<Node id="406795" /> <Node id="406796" />What answer he saw on the forehead at which he
gazed she could not guess, but he spoke then in a low and careful voice.<Node id="406915" />

<Node id="406917" />'<Node id="406918" />In the Crown of Suleiman the Wise--the Peace be upon him!<Node id="406975" />--' <Node id="406979" />he said,
'there was a Stone, and this Stone was that which is the First Matter of
Creation, holy and terrible.<Node id="407089" /> <Node id="407090" />But on the hand of the King there was a
Ring and in the Ring another secret, more holy and terrible than the
Stone.<Node id="407205" /> <Node id="407206" />For within the Ring there was a point of that Light which is the
Spirit of Creation, the Adornment of the Unity, the Knowledge of the
Loveliness, the Divine Image in the mirror of the worlds, just and true.<Node id="407412" />
<Node id="407413" />This was the Justice and the Wisdom of Suleiman, by which all souls were
made manifest to him and all causes rightly determined.<Node id="407541" /> <Node id="407542" />Also when within
the Holy of Holies in the Temple that the King made he laid his crown
upon the Ark and between the wings of the Cherubim, and held his hand
over it, the Light of the Ring shone upon the Stone and all things had
peace.<Node id="407776" /> <Node id="407777" />But when the King erred, building altars to strange gods, he
dared no longer let the Light fall upon the Stone; also he put aside the
Ring and it is told that Asmodeus sat upon his throne seven years.<Node id="407977" /> <Node id="407978" />But I
think that perhaps the King himself had not all that time parted from
his throne, how closely soever Asmodeus dwelt within his soul.<Node id="408116" /> <Node id="408117" />And of
the hiding place of the Ring I do not know, nor any of my house; if it
is on earth it is very secret.<Node id="408225" /> <Node id="408226" />But the Light of it is in the Stone and
all the Types of the Stone--and the Power of it is in the soul and body
of any who have sought the union with the Stone, so that whoever touches
them in anger or hatred or evil desire is subjected to the Light and
Power of the Adornment of the Unity.<Node id="408516" /> <Node id="408517" />And this I think my nephew did, and
this is the cause of his blasting and hurling out.<Node id="408603" />'<Node id="408604" />

<Node id="408606" />He looked straight at Chloe.<Node id="408634" /> '<Node id="408636" />But woe, woe, woe to you,' he said, 'if
from this time forth for ever you forget that you gave your will to the
Will of That which is behind the Stone.<Node id="408787" />'<Node id="408788" />

<Node id="408790" />Chloe started to her feet with a cry.<Node id="408827" /> '<Node id="408829" />It isn't true,' she broke out,
'it isn't true!<Node id="408875" /> <Node id="408876" />What have I done to bring all this on me?<Node id="408917" /> <Node id="408918" />I can't bear
it; it isn't, it mustn't be true.<Node id="408964" />'<Node id="408965" />

<Node id="408967" />Lord Arglay's voice answered her.<Node id="409000" /> '<Node id="409002" />All is well,' he said, 'all is well,
child.<Node id="409045" /> <Node id="409046" />You shall do nothing that you cannot do and bear nothing that you
cannot bear.<Node id="409124" /> <Node id="409125" />I will see to that.<Node id="409144" />' <Node id="409146" />He held out his hand towards her, and,
shaken and terrified, she caught it.<Node id="409221" /> '<Node id="409223" />Sit down,' he went on, smiling at
her, 'and we will know what all this is.<Node id="409297" />'<Node id="409298" />

<Node id="409300" />'<Node id="409301" />What are you,' the Hajji asked, more astonished than indignant, 'to
promise to govern the Stone?<Node id="409397" />'<Node id="409398" />

<Node id="409400" />'<Node id="409401" />Why, in some sense,' Lord Arglay said, smiling again, 'I am at the
moment, as you say, the Light that is in the Stone.<Node id="409519" /> <Node id="409520" />Not that I ever
meant or wanted to be.<Node id="409558" />'<Node id="409559" />

<Node id="409561" />'<Node id="409562" />I do not understand you,' the Hajji exclaimed in bewilderment.<Node id="409624" /> '<Node id="409626" />You act
as if you believed in the Stone, yet you talk like an infidel.<Node id="409696" /> <Node id="409697" />Are you
for or against this Sanctity?<Node id="409734" />'<Node id="409735" />

<Node id="409737" />'<Node id="409738" />That it may decide for itself,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="409787" /> '<Node id="409789" />I am no light to my
own mind, I promise you.<Node id="409833" /> <Node id="409834" />But if what you say is true, and the Stone is
a thing of goodness, and has saved this child last night, then we may
agree yet.<Node id="409960" />'<Node id="409961" />

<Node id="409963" />The Hajji shook his head.<Node id="409988" /> '<Node id="409990" />I do not understand,' he said almost
pitifully.<Node id="410037" /> '<Node id="410039" />Why will you always mock?<Node id="410064" />'<Node id="410065" />

<Node id="410067" />'<Node id="410068" />I do not mock,' Arglay answered, 'or if I do I would have you consider
whether this may not be part of your Mystery.<Node id="410184" /> <Node id="410185" />But we will not now talk
of the place of mockery among the gifts of the King Suleiman, although
if he never smiled at himself the Court of the King must have been a
very sombre place.<Node id="410368" /> <Node id="410369" />I have known other Courts which were so, but they
were, often, without any kind of light.<Node id="410458" /> <Node id="410459" />Let us talk quietly of this.<Node id="410487" />'<Node id="410488" />

<Node id="410490" />He drew from his pocket a small jewel case and laid it on the table,
then he released his hand from Chloe's and touched her shoulder as she
sat.<Node id="410634" /> '<Node id="410636" />Is everything well?<Node id="410655" />' <Node id="410657" />he said.<Node id="410665" />

<Node id="410667" />She looked at him, in a returning serenity.<Node id="410710" /> '<Node id="410712" />Everything,' she said, 'I
was afraid.<Node id="410749" />'<Node id="410750" />

<Node id="410752" />'<Node id="410753" />Do not be afraid,' he said.<Node id="410780" /> '<Node id="410782" />Consider that we, if anything at all can
be, are in the knowledge of the illuminated Stone.<Node id="410873" />'<Node id="410874" />

<Node id="410876" />He opened the case, and his Type lay before them, but in it there was
a change.<Node id="410955" /> <Node id="410956" />The Stone was glowing with a stronger colour than before; its
size was no greater but its depth seemed, as in some great jewel, to be
infinitely increased, and in that depth the markings which had seemed
like letters arose in a new and richer darkness.<Node id="411208" /> <Node id="411209" />It expanded within;
and the eyes of those who gazed were drawn down the shapes of the
Tetragrammaton into its midst where the intervolutions of cream and gold
mingled themselves in what was more like cloud than Stone.<Node id="411426" /> <Node id="411427" />The Hajji
looked and covered his eyes with his hand, pronouncing in a low voice
the formula of the Unity.<Node id="411532" /> <Node id="411533" />Lord Arglay looked and there came upon his
face a half-smile of such affectionate irony as that with which he had
glanced at Chloe--'this thing,' he seemed to say, 'cannot be and yet it
is.<Node id="411722" />' <Node id="411724" />Chloe looked, and unconsciously put out her hand toward the Stone,
not as if to take hold, but naturally as if it were on the point of
clasping that of some sufficient lover.<Node id="411898" /> <Node id="411899" />It moved forward and then sank
and rested on the table close to the Stone, and Lord Arglay, including
it also in his gaze, wondered suddenly at the kinship between the two.<Node id="412071" />
<Node id="412072" />For the hand and the Stone were to his eyes both softly translucent;
though the shapes were different, the matter of both was the same, and
if the one was to be raised the other was capable of raising it.<Node id="412276" /> <Node id="412277" />He
permitted for a moment the fancy that that hand was but pausing before
it lifted up, not the Stone, but the whole round world, playing with it
as a ball upon its palm.<Node id="412447" /> <Node id="412448" />He remembered the Hand thrust out from a cloud
in many an early painting to image the Power behind creation, and the
hand that lay open before him seemed meant to receive that creation as
it came into being.<Node id="412655" /> <Node id="412656" />He saw--even while, rightly wise in his own proper
generation among these things, he refused to believe too easily--that
the Stone no longer rested on the table but that it threw out of itself
colour shaped into the table: the walls and furniture were in themselves
reflections of that Centre in which they secretly existed; they were
separations, forms, and clouded visibilities of its elements, and he
also and other mortals who moved among them.<Node id="413104" /> <Node id="413105" />The Stone quivered with its
own intense and hidden life, and through the unknown hand that appeared
close beside it there passed an answering quiver.<Node id="413254" /> <Node id="413255" />Arglay saw it and held
his breath for what might ensue.<Node id="413310" /> <Node id="413311" />But nothing more ensued, or nothing
that could be apprehended by his critical mind.<Node id="413394" /> <Node id="413395" />The hand which had been
for a moment a mystery of the same nature as the Stone resolved itself
again into the hand of Chloe Burnett.<Node id="413527" /> <Node id="413528" />The Stone, parted to his vision
again from the world, lay on the table where he had set it.<Node id="413619" /> <Node id="413620" />He looked up
suddenly and as Chloe also moved their eyes met.<Node id="413681" />

<Node id="413683" />'<Node id="413684" />And still,' he said, 'even so, you _did_ muddle up those quotations.<Node id="413752" />'<Node id="413753" />

<Node id="413755" />She smiled across at him.<Node id="413780" /> '<Node id="413782" />Am I not forgiven?<Node id="413800" />' <Node id="413802" />she asked.<Node id="413812" />

<Node id="413814" />'<Node id="413815" />No,' Lord Arglay said thoughtfully, 'no, I do not think you are
_forgiven_.<Node id="413890" />' <Node id="413892" />He considered the Stone again.<Node id="413922" /> '<Node id="413924" />Lay your Type here,' he
went on, 'and let us see if they agree.<Node id="413987" />'<Node id="413988" />

<Node id="413990" />She went across the room to her typewriting table, picked up and opened
her bag, looked into it, felt in it, looked again, and turned to him
with an exclamation.<Node id="414151" /> '<Node id="414153" />It isn't here,' she cried.<Node id="414179" />

<Node id="414181" />The Hajji looked round with a start of attention; Lord Arglay went
swiftly over to her.<Node id="414268" /> '<Node id="414270" />Was it there?<Node id="414283" />' <Node id="414285" />he asked.<Node id="414294" />

<Node id="414296" />'<Node id="414297" />Certainly it was,' Chloe cried.<Node id="414328" /> '<Node id="414330" />I looked at it this morning just
before Frank came in.<Node id="414384" />'<Node id="414385" />

<Node id="414387" />Arglay turned back towards the table where the Type lay.<Node id="414443" /> '<Node id="414445" />Can the two
already have become one?<Node id="414481" />' <Node id="414483" />he said.<Node id="414491" /> '<Node id="414493" />Are all the Types of the Stone
restored?<Node id="414533" />'<Node id="414534" />

<Node id="414536" />Ibrahim joined them, asking, 'What is the matter?<Node id="414585" />'<Node id="414586" />

<Node id="414588" />'<Node id="414589" />I had a Stone here,' Chloe said, agitation growing in her--'not an hour
ago it was here, and now it is gone.<Node id="414697" />'<Node id="414698" />

<Node id="414700" />The Hajji gazed, and shook his head.<Node id="414736" /> '<Node id="414738" />I do not think they are yet all
one,' he said, 'for no soul has yet made itself a way for the Stone to
be what it will in itself.<Node id="414867" /> <Node id="414868" />I think it is more likely that you have been
robbed of it.<Node id="414926" />'<Node id="414927" />

<Node id="414929" />Lord Arglay frowned, but before he could speak Chloe broke out in an
exclamation of horror.<Node id="415020" /> '<Node id="415022" />O no,' she cried, 'no,' and looked at him with
troubled eyes.<Node id="415083" />

<Node id="415085" />'<Node id="415086" />Who has been here since you saw it?<Node id="415121" />' <Node id="415123" />the Hajji asked, and the girl,
still staring at Arglay, answered, 'It couldn't be,' but more in fear
than doubt.<Node id="415235" />

<Node id="415237" />'<Node id="415238" />Why, all of us are capable of all misfortunes at all times,' the Chief
Justice answered.<Node id="415326" /> '<Node id="415328" />Are you very certain that it was here?<Node id="415366" />'<Node id="415367" />

<Node id="415369" />'<Node id="415370" />I am quite certain,' Chloe answered, 'for I ...<Node id="415417" /> <Node id="415418" />I adored it while you
were telephoning.<Node id="415457" />'<Node id="415458" />

<Node id="415460" />'<Node id="415461" />And are you certain,' Arglay said to Ibrahim, 'that the Types of the
Stone are not yet made one?<Node id="415557" />'<Node id="415558" />

<Node id="415560" />'<Node id="415561" />I am not certain,' he answered, 'who can be certain of the movement of
Justice?<Node id="415640" /> <Node id="415641" />But I think that a further devotion is needed.<Node id="415687" />'<Node id="415688" />

<Node id="415690" />Lord Arglay turned back to Chloe.<Node id="415723" /> '<Node id="415725" />Well,' he said, 'there is no need
for us to decide, for there is nothing that we could do.<Node id="415815" /> <Node id="415816" />If it has been
taken, let us desire that goodwill may go with it, and that I will very
gladly do.<Node id="415913" />'<Node id="415914" />

<Node id="415916" />'<Node id="415917" />But I must go after him,' Chloe said, 'I must make him give it back.<Node id="415985" /> <Node id="415986" />It
is my fault--perhaps I ought to have given it to him.<Node id="416042" /> <Node id="416043" />Only ...<Node id="416051" /> <Node id="416052" />O what
have I done?<Node id="416071" />'<Node id="416072" />

<Node id="416074" />'<Node id="416075" />Nothing but what was wise,' Arglay said.<Node id="416115" /> '<Node id="416117" />Let us forget it.<Node id="416134" /> <Node id="416135" />You and I
are here, and also a Type of the Stone.<Node id="416184" /> <Node id="416185" />Let it rest at that, and we are
where we were before.<Node id="416238" />'<Node id="416239" />

<Node id="416241" />'<Node id="416242" />Not quite,' the Hajji said, 'for as there is but one End, so there is
now but one Stone with you, and it may be one path for the Stone.<Node id="416377" /> <Node id="416378" />It may
be that the path and the Stone and the End are shown you that they may
be one.<Node id="416463" />'<Node id="416464" />

<Node id="416466" />Lord Arglay had turned to go to the Type that remained when he was
interrupted by the entrance of the maid with a telegram.<Node id="416589" /> <Node id="416590" />He took it from
her, opened and read it, and gave a low exclamation.<Node id="416658" /> <Node id="416659" />Then, 'There is no
immediate answer,' he said, and as the maid went out he went back to the
other two.<Node id="416761" />

<Node id="416763" />'<Node id="416764" />They have dealt with Reginald,' he said.<Node id="416804" /> '<Node id="416806" />Your friends again, I expect,
Hajji.<Node id="416842" />'<Node id="416843" />

<Node id="416845" />Chloe said, 'What has happened to Mr. Montague?<Node id="416892" />'<Node id="416893" />

<Node id="416895" />'<Node id="416896" />They have killed him,' Arglay answered, and for once negligent of an
absurdity read the telegram aloud.<Node id="416999" />


     <Node id="417007" />'<Node id="417008" />From the Hotel Montespan, Brighton.<Node id="417043" /> <Node id="417044" />Gentleman seriously injured
     by burglars and afterwards died here registered as Reginald
     Montague Rowland Street West gave your name as that of relation
     burglar unfortunately escaped but no apparent trace of theft
     would like to confer Gregson manager.<Node id="417314" />'<Node id="417315" />


<Node id="417318" />After a moment's silence Arglay said, 'I am sorry for Reginald.<Node id="417381" /> <Node id="417382" />He was
a fool but he wasn't malevolent....<Node id="417424" /> <Node id="417425" />And now there is only us--and the
others.<Node id="417466" />'<Node id="417467" />

<Node id="417469" />'<Node id="417470" />Shall you go to Brighton?<Node id="417495" />' <Node id="417497" />the Hajji asked.<Node id="417513" />

<Node id="417515" />'<Node id="417516" />Certainly I shall go,' Lord Arglay said, 'for if by chance it was not a
thing done to gain the Stone then any that he had may still be there.<Node id="417657" /> <Node id="417658" />I
do not think that I shall find one, but I will take no risks.<Node id="417721" /> <Node id="417722" />Besides,
as things are, I would not have even Reginald's death quite unnoticed,
whatever catastrophe awaits us.<Node id="417833" />'<Node id="417834" />

<Node id="417836" />'<Node id="417837" />And this Type that you have?<Node id="417865" />' <Node id="417867" />Ibrahim asked, pointing to it.<Node id="417897" />

<Node id="417899" />'<Node id="417900" />That I will leave here,' Lord Arglay said, 'and Miss Burnett shall
guard it for the few hours that I shall be gone.<Node id="418015" /> <Node id="418016" />They will not attack
the house of the Chief Justice in full daylight, and if any come to take
it in the name of the Law then Miss Burnett shall do what she chooses.<Node id="418180" />
<Node id="418181" />And you, Hajji?<Node id="418196" />'<Node id="418197" />

<Node id="418199" />'<Node id="418200" />If this is true,' Ibrahim answered, 'I will not go back to those who
are already shedding blood.<Node id="418296" />'<Node id="418297" />

<Node id="418299" />'<Node id="418300" />Then you also shall be here,' Lord Arglay said, 'And you two shall talk
together and see if there is anything to be done.<Node id="418421" /> <Node id="418422" />For so far,' he added
in an unwonted outbreak of anger, 'I have done nothing at all.<Node id="418506" /> <Node id="418507" />Nothing.<Node id="418515" />
<Node id="418516" />I have been only a useless loquacity.<Node id="418553" />'<Node id="418554" />

<Node id="418556" />'<Node id="418557" />It isn't true,' Chloe said.<Node id="418584" />

<Node id="418586" />'<Node id="418587" />Well--if you can think of anything, except trying to bring a laboratory
assistant out of yesterday ...<Node id="418689" />' <Node id="418691" />the Chief Justice answered, still
bitterly.<Node id="418734" />

<Node id="418736" />'<Node id="418737" />You may have been more than you know,' the Hajji put in.<Node id="418793" />

<Node id="418795" />'<Node id="418796" />O I may ...<Node id="418807" />' <Node id="418809" />Lord Arglay said.<Node id="418826" /> '<Node id="418828" />They also serve who only sit about and
chat.<Node id="418872" /> <Node id="418873" />But after believing in God----'<Node id="418904" />

<Node id="418906" />'<Node id="418907" />Ah but you do!<Node id="418921" />' <Node id="418923" />Chloe cried, 'and is that doing nothing?<Node id="418963" />'<Node id="418964" />

<Node id="418966" />Lord Arglay looked at her.<Node id="418992" /> '<Node id="418994" />It is giving a new name to old things,' he
said.<Node id="419042" /> '<Node id="419044" />Or perhaps an old name to new things.<Node id="419081" /> <Node id="419082" />Don't worry, child.<Node id="419101" /> <Node id="419102" />I will
go to Brighton, and do you consider the doctrine that is within the
Stone.<Node id="419183" />'<Node id="419184" />




<Node id="419189" />CHAPTER XVI<Node id="419200" />

<Node id="419202" />THE DISCOVERY OF SIR GILES TUMULTY<Node id="419236" />


<Node id="419239" />The same afternoon, while Lord Arglay was hearing at Brighton of the
extraordinary events (so the manager called them) of the previous
night--how someone, so far untraced, must have got into Mr. Montague's
room, and how Mr. Montague's mutilated body had been discovered there in
the morning; while he himself was finding that there was no trace of any
Type of the Stone among Reginald's belongings--while this separation
of a single Type from the rest was proceeding, Lord Birlesmere and
Mr. Garterr Browne sat in a room at the Home Office and talked.<Node id="419790" /> <Node id="419791" />Lord
Birlesmere was agitated; Mr. Garterr Browne was calm and bright.<Node id="419860" />

<Node id="419862" />'<Node id="419863" />Tumulty tells me nothing,' the Foreign Secretary was saying.<Node id="419923" /> '<Node id="419925" />I tried
to get hold of him yesterday, but I couldn't.<Node id="419978" /> <Node id="419979" />That fellow Palliser who
was with him would only say that he hoped in time to find some way of
control.<Node id="420082" />'<Node id="420083" />

<Node id="420085" />'<Node id="420086" />It might be awfully useful if he did,' Mr. Garterr Browne said, 'I see
that.<Node id="420162" /> <Node id="420163" />But it's going to take time, and I don't think at present either
of us can afford the time.<Node id="420254" />'<Node id="420255" />

<Node id="420257" />'<Node id="420258" />That's quite true.<Node id="420276" /> <Node id="420277" />I don't know what's happened,' Birlesmere answered,
'but there was an unpleasant note in the Persian man's voice.<Node id="420390" /> <Node id="420391" />I've just
seen him, and they're more sure of themselves.<Node id="420447" /> <Node id="420448" />He even began to hint at
Geneva and perhaps something more.<Node id="420507" />'<Node id="420508" />

<Node id="420510" />'<Node id="420511" />Well,' Mr. Garterr Browne went on, 'I think I may say that, as soon as
I heard of it, I saw what would have to be done.<Node id="420630" /> <Node id="420631" />One thing, anyhow, I
don't know about Persia, but I think it'll quiet things here.<Node id="420713" />'<Node id="420714" />

<Node id="420716" />'<Node id="420717" />And what's that?<Node id="420733" />' <Node id="420735" />Birlesmere asked.<Node id="420752" />

<Node id="420754" />Mr.<Node id="420757" /> <Node id="420758" />Garterr Browne smiled slyly.<Node id="420786" /> '<Node id="420788" />Ask yourself,' he said, 'why
people--this Mayor, for instance--are making such a fuss about the
Stone.<Node id="420890" /> <Node id="420891" />Why, because they think it _does_ things.<Node id="420932" />'<Node id="420933" />

<Node id="420935" />'<Node id="420936" />So it does,' Lord Birlesmere said.<Node id="420970" />

<Node id="420972" />'<Node id="420973" />Never mind whether it does or not,' Garterr Browne said sharply.<Node id="421037" /> '<Node id="421039" />The
point is that they believe it does.<Node id="421078" /> <Node id="421079" />Very well.<Node id="421089" /> <Node id="421090" />What do we want to do
then?<Node id="421117" /> <Node id="421118" />Stop them believing it.<Node id="421141" /> <Node id="421142" />How do we do that?<Node id="421160" /> <Node id="421161" />Tell them, and show
them, that it doesn't.<Node id="421203" />'<Node id="421204" />

<Node id="421206" />'<Node id="421207" />But it does,' Lord Birlesmere said again.<Node id="421248" />

<Node id="421250" />'<Node id="421251" />The first thing I said to myself,' Mr. Garterr Browne went on, 'when I
realized it, was--people must simply not be allowed to believe in it.<Node id="421391" />
<Node id="421392" />The second thing was--thank God it's stone.<Node id="421435" />'<Node id="421436" />

<Node id="421438" />Lord Birlesmere sat and stared.<Node id="421469" /> <Node id="421470" />Mr. Garterr Browne sat and smiled, then
he resumed.<Node id="421521" />

<Node id="421523" />'<Node id="421524" />How can one stop them believing in it?<Node id="421562" /> <Node id="421563" />As I've just said--tell them
it doesn't work; show them it doesn't work.<Node id="421635" /> <Node id="421636" />And if it does, show them
something that doesn't.<Node id="421685" />'<Node id="421686" />

<Node id="421688" />'<Node id="421689" />Good God!<Node id="421698" />' <Node id="421700" />Lord Birlesmere exclaimed.<Node id="421726" />

<Node id="421728" />'<Node id="421729" />Stone,' the other said, still smiling, 'isn't rare.<Node id="421780" /> <Node id="421781" />Marked stone isn't
rare.<Node id="421805" /> <Node id="421806" />Of course, to a shade the markings....<Node id="421844" /> <Node id="421845" />I don't say that the tints
are exactly....<Node id="421887" /> <Node id="421888" />But near enough.<Node id="421904" /> <Node id="421905" />I got hold of a man, and I went over
his place, and I found bits.<Node id="421970" /> <Node id="421971" />I've known him rather well for years--he
was a contractor for the new Government buildings--and I found a bit of
what I wanted.<Node id="422098" />'<Node id="422099" />

<Node id="422101" />He pulled out a drawer and extracted something from it which he threw
across to Lord Birlesmere.<Node id="422197" /> <Node id="422198" />It was a fragment of square stone, having a
black streak or two in it.<Node id="422268" /> <Node id="422269" />But it was a poor imitation of the Stone of
Suleiman, and so Lord Birlesmere, having considered it, felt compelled
to say.<Node id="422391" />

<Node id="422393" />'<Node id="422394" />No one would take it for the same thing,' he said.<Node id="422444" />

<Node id="422446" />'<Node id="422447" />No one who hasn't got the original is likely to be able to compare,'
Garterr Browne said.<Node id="422536" /> '<Node id="422538" />And who's got it?<Node id="422555" /> <Node id="422556" />Sheldrake--well, he must keep
his for the present; the Persians--well, if they know we'll keep it
quiet they won't want to make a fuss; Tumulty and Palliser--well, they
must be careful in their experiments, but they're not likely to act in
public; you--that's all right; Arglay--that is a little awkward, but
he's a sensible fellow and we'll talk to him.<Node id="422910" /> <Node id="422911" />I fancy Merridew's trying
to get a bit but I don't think he has yet--and anyhow he'll want it kept
quiet; he was here saying so.<Node id="423039" />'<Node id="423040" />

<Node id="423042" />'<Node id="423043" />But, good God,' Lord Birlesmere said, 'people won't believe that these
cures and so on didn't happen.<Node id="423144" />'<Node id="423145" />

<Node id="423147" />'<Node id="423148" />We shan't ask them to,' Garterr Browne explained.<Node id="423197" /> '<Node id="423199" />They may _have_
happened; they don't happen now.<Node id="423247" /> <Node id="423248" />Something has changed--the Stone has
been exposed to the air or something.<Node id="423322" /> <Node id="423323" />Rays ...<Node id="423331" /> <Node id="423332" />rays might have been
exhausted.<Node id="423363" /> <Node id="423364" />Tumulty and I'll manage a convincing statement.<Node id="423411" /> <Node id="423412" />Just keep it
firmly in your mind that people must not be allowed to believe in it.<Node id="423494" />'<Node id="423495" />

<Node id="423497" />'<Node id="423498" />But then why worry about having this thing?<Node id="423541" />' <Node id="423543" />Birlesmere asked.<Node id="423560" /> '<Node id="423562" />You
can tell them all that anyhow.<Node id="423596" />'<Node id="423597" />

<Node id="423599" />Mr.<Node id="423602" /> <Node id="423603" />Garterr Browne almost winked.<Node id="423632" /> '<Node id="423634" />You wait,' he said.<Node id="423653" /> '<Node id="423655" />That Mayor's
coming round here again, and it'll sound more convincing if I produce
this.<Node id="423743" /> <Node id="423744" />Besides--I'm not certain, but I _may_ decide to get a few
scientific opinions on the virtue and age of the thing, a few doctors
or something.<Node id="423885" />'<Node id="423886" />

<Node id="423888" />'<Node id="423889" />They certainly won't believe that _that_ did anything,' Lord Birlesmere
said.<Node id="423966" />

<Node id="423968" />'<Node id="423969" />Nor very likely did the other,' Garterr Browne answered.<Node id="424025" /> '<Node id="424027" />Think of the
number of people who _don't_ believe in it now, and those who don't want
to.<Node id="424116" /> <Node id="424117" />All we need for public opinion is a focus.<Node id="424159" />' <Node id="424161" />He got up in great glee
and pointed to the bit of stone.<Node id="424217" /> '<Node id="424219" />This is the focus.<Node id="424237" />' <Node id="424239" />He made gestures
with both hands.<Node id="424272" /> '<Node id="424274" />We concentrate,' he said, 'by a semi-official
statement.<Node id="424330" /> <Node id="424331" />Now how many people, in face of that, and their neighbours,
are going on believing in an obviously absurd Stone?<Node id="424443" /> <Node id="424444" />Ask yourself,
Birlesmere, would you?<Node id="424480" />'<Node id="424481" />

<Node id="424483" />'<Node id="424484" />If I'd _seen_ it...<Node id="424503" />' <Node id="424505" />Lord Birlesmere began.<Node id="424527" />

<Node id="424529" />'<Node id="424530" />Pooh!<Node id="424535" /> <Node id="424536" />coincidence,' said the other.<Node id="424565" /> '<Node id="424567" />Pure coincidence.<Node id="424584" />'<Node id="424585" />

<Node id="424587" />'<Node id="424588" />And suppose one of the original Stones gets about somehow?<Node id="424646" />' <Node id="424648" />Birlesmere
asked.<Node id="424665" /> '<Node id="424667" />How will the Government look then?<Node id="424701" /> <Node id="424702" />It's a damned risky business,
Browne, and I don't half like it.<Node id="424765" />'<Node id="424766" />

<Node id="424768" />'<Node id="424769" />Nor you mayn't,' Mr. Garterr Browne, a little huffed, answered.<Node id="424832" /> '<Node id="424834" />But
you don't like simplicity.<Node id="424864" /> <Node id="424865" />Look here--this _is_ the Stone, don't you
see?<Node id="424911" /> <Node id="424912" />It is; it just is.<Node id="424930" /> <Node id="424931" />And it doesn't do anything at all.<Node id="424965" /> <Node id="424966" />Of course, we
shall try and get hold of all the others.<Node id="425021" /> <Node id="425022" />Tumulty ought to do that.<Node id="425047" />'<Node id="425048" />

<Node id="425050" />'<Node id="425051" />Tumulty won't do anything but what he wants,' Birlesmere said.<Node id="425113" /> '<Node id="425115" />And I
don't like the way the Persians are talking.<Node id="425165" /> <Node id="425166" />Suppose it _does_ come up
at Geneva?<Node id="425202" />'<Node id="425203" />

<Node id="425205" />'<Node id="425206" />Well, give them this,' the Home Secretary suggested.<Node id="425258" /> '<Node id="425260" />Who's to know?<Node id="425274" />
<Node id="425275" />They only want it for a temple or something, I suppose, so this would be
just as good.<Node id="425361" /> <Node id="425362" />It isn't as if it was a matter of practical importance.<Node id="425417" />
<Node id="425418" />And would even they know the difference?<Node id="425458" /> <Node id="425459" />Why, I can hardly believe there
is any.<Node id="425498" />'<Node id="425499" />

<Node id="425501" />'<Node id="425502" />O I think there is,' Birlesmere protested.<Node id="425544" /> '<Node id="425546" />The marking looks
different.<Node id="425574" />'<Node id="425575" />

<Node id="425577" />'<Node id="425578" />O the marking, the marking,' said Mr. Garterr Browne impatiently.<Node id="425643" />
'<Node id="425645" />God's truth, man, what does the marking matter?<Node id="425692" /> <Node id="425693" />Here am I faced with a
riot or a strike and you with a war, and there you sit bleating about
the marking.<Node id="425798" /> <Node id="425799" />If you get to rock-bottom, if you come down to actual
facts, it is that or this.<Node id="425879" /> <Node id="425880" />Which will you have?<Node id="425900" />'<Node id="425901" />

<Node id="425903" />'<Node id="425904" />O this of course,' Lord Birlesmere said.<Node id="425944" />

<Node id="425946" />'<Node id="425947" />Do you agree to my telling this Mayor, when he comes in a few minutes,
that this is it?<Node id="426034" />' <Node id="426036" />the other pressed again.<Node id="426060" />

<Node id="426062" />'<Node id="426063" />Yes, O yes,' Birlesmere assented.<Node id="426096" /> '<Node id="426098" />Only you must back me up too with
the Persian.<Node id="426144" />'<Node id="426145" />

<Node id="426147" />'<Node id="426148" />United we stand, divided we fall,' Mr. Garterr Browne almost sang.<Node id="426214" />
'<Node id="426216" />It's quite simple, Birlesmere, so long as you keep firmly in mind that
people _must not_ be allowed to believe in it.<Node id="426333" /> <Node id="426334" />In fact, of course, they
don't believe in it; nobody could.<Node id="426393" /> <Node id="426394" />So we're only making their real minds
clear to them.<Node id="426446" />'<Node id="426447" />

<Node id="426449" />'<Node id="426450" />But----' the Foreign Secretary began.<Node id="426487" />

<Node id="426489" />'<Node id="426490" />I know, I know,' the other interrupted.<Node id="426529" /> '<Node id="426531" />You used it, didn't you?<Node id="426555" /> <Node id="426556" />You
and Tumulty.<Node id="426572" /> <Node id="426573" />Yes, but, my dear fellow, are you sure you did?<Node id="426620" /> <Node id="426621" />Looking
back now, are you sure it wasn't a kind of illusion?<Node id="426681" /> <Node id="426682" />You may know it
wasn't because you have the Stone, but will those who haven't it know?<Node id="426768" />'<Node id="426769" />

<Node id="426771" />The telephone rang and he bent to it.<Node id="426808" /> '<Node id="426810" />O bring him in,' he said.<Node id="426835" /> '<Node id="426837" />Now
here is the Mayor; now you see.<Node id="426872" />'<Node id="426873" />

<Node id="426875" />The Mayor came in heavily.<Node id="426901" /> <Node id="426902" />His meeting with Merridew had shaken his
determination far more than he had known at the time, for since then he
had become gradually aware of how strong, within his public feeling and
his desire for the good of the common folk, had been the hope to save
that son who lay cancer-stricken at home, and also of what a strong case
Merridew might present for the suppression of the Stone.<Node id="427286" /> <Node id="427287" />He had supposed
good to be single, and it was divided; to be clear, and it was very
clouded; to be inevitable, and it was remotely receding.<Node id="427427" /> <Node id="427428" />With dull eyes,
and a heart almost broken by public and private pain, he faced the Home
Secretary.<Node id="427526" />

<Node id="427528" />'<Node id="427529" />I have come to know if you have any news for me,' he said.<Node id="427587" />

<Node id="427589" />Mr.<Node id="427592" /> <Node id="427593" />Garterr Browne shook a sympathetic head.<Node id="427633" /> '<Node id="427635" />I am afraid,' he said,
'that what I have is, in a sense, worse even than you might fear.<Node id="427723" /> <Node id="427724" />In
fact, we have discovered that the matter has settled itself.<Node id="427787" />' <Node id="427789" />He paused
and the Mayor stared at him; then he resumed.<Node id="427844" /> '<Node id="427846" />Yes, settled itself.<Node id="427866" /> <Node id="427867" />You
see,' he picked up the stone that lay on the table, 'you see apparently
this thing changes; at least, I mean a change comes in it.<Node id="428001" /> <Node id="428002" />It doesn't
_retain_ its powers.<Node id="428033" /> <Node id="428034" />Lord Birlesmere here will bear me out that we have
been very much startled and shocked to find that after a while the
qualities of the Stone, the special qualities both of transport and
medicine, disappear.<Node id="428240" /> <Node id="428241" />It becomes apparently just an ordinary piece of ...<Node id="428292" />
<Node id="428293" />mineral.<Node id="428301" /> <Node id="428302" />We are, as I told you, having it investigated, but our advisers
report to the worst effect, and I am bound to say that what Lord
Birlesmere and I myself have been able to see has confirmed us in
accepting that report.<Node id="428519" /> <Node id="428520" />It may be that the air has a ...<Node id="428552" /> <Node id="428553" />a modifying
effect or that some inherent virtue becomes exhausted--like radium, I
mean like radium doesn't, if you follow me.<Node id="428678" /> <Node id="428679" />It may be that some central
ray-diffusing nucleus disperses itself gradually.<Node id="428756" /> <Node id="428757" />I couldn't say.<Node id="428772" /> <Node id="428773" />But as
a result--well, there we are.<Node id="428809" /> <Node id="428810" />Nothing happens.<Node id="428826" /> <Node id="428827" />I chanced,' Mr. Garterr
Browne went on suddenly, apparently resolving to do the whole business
well, while he was about it--'I happened to have neuralgia early this
morning rather badly, and so of course I thought....<Node id="429044" /> <Node id="429045" />But there it is, my
neuralgia didn't stop.<Node id="429087" /> <Node id="429088" />I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, for I
know what you must be feeling, what indeed I'm feeling myself.<Node id="429197" /> <Node id="429198" />But there
it is.<Node id="429214" /> <Node id="429215" />Truth will out.<Node id="429230" />'<Node id="429231" />

<Node id="429233" />With this sudden peroration Mr. Garterr Browne put the stone back on his
table and looked at the Mayor.<Node id="429336" /> <Node id="429337" />The Mayor, without invitation, sat down
suddenly.<Node id="429386" /> <Node id="429387" />He stared at the stone which, up to now, he had not seen.<Node id="429444" />

<Node id="429446" />'<Node id="429447" />This is it?<Node id="429458" />' <Node id="429460" />he asked.<Node id="429469" />

<Node id="429471" />'<Node id="429472" />This is it,' Mr. Garterr Browne said regretfully, while Lord
Birlesmere inhaled audibly and thought of that earlier moment when Lord
Arglay's secretary had made a scene in a Government office on behalf
of the Stone of Suleiman.<Node id="429699" /> <Node id="429700" />How much quieter things were, he considered,
round Browne's stone!<Node id="429766" /> <Node id="429767" />If only it could be kept up, and after all there
was no reason why it shouldn't be.<Node id="429850" /> <Node id="429851" />No one could tell, except by the
general growth of peace and quiet, which stone had really better exist.<Node id="429955" />
<Node id="429956" />Strong measures perhaps, but difficult times required strong measures.<Node id="430026" />

<Node id="430028" />The Mayor said slowly: 'Do your scientific men, your doctors, assure you
that this is quite useless?<Node id="430128" />'<Node id="430129" />

<Node id="430131" />'<Node id="430132" />Alas, yes,' Mr. Garterr Browne said reluctantly.<Node id="430180" />

<Node id="430182" />'<Node id="430183" />And what of the other Stones?<Node id="430212" />' <Node id="430214" />the Mayor asked.<Node id="430230" /> '<Node id="430232" />Have they also become
useless?<Node id="430262" />'<Node id="430263" />

<Node id="430265" />'<Node id="430266" />Well, so far as we can test them,' the Home Secretary answered, with
an air of complete frankness.<Node id="430364" /> '<Node id="430366" />There are one or two we haven't got, of
course.<Node id="430413" /> <Node id="430414" />There's Sir Giles Tumulty's; he's working on it, so no doubt we
shall hear.<Node id="430489" />'<Node id="430490" />

<Node id="430492" />There was a short silence.<Node id="430518" /> <Node id="430519" />Then the Mayor said, 'It is certain that this
Stone can do nothing?<Node id="430586" />'<Node id="430587" />

<Node id="430589" />'<Node id="430590" />It is perfectly certain,' Mr. Garterr Browne answered, tasting the
words as if he were enjoying the savour of the truth that they
contained, 'that this stone can do nothing.<Node id="430763" />'<Node id="430764" />

<Node id="430766" />The Mayor stretched out his hand, picked up the stone, looked at it,
turned it over in his hand, and then sat for a moment holding it.<Node id="430900" /> <Node id="430901" />At
this last moment of his hopes, when he realized that, in consequence of
this new discovery of the mysterious nature of the stone, he was about
to return to Rich disappointed and crushed and compelled to crush and
disappoint--at this moment it was impossible for him not to make one
last personal effort.<Node id="431207" /> <Node id="431208" />It was useless, of course, but if any virtue
remained, if, defeated in the State, he could still succeed in the
household by some last lingering potency, if he could help his son----He
shaped the wish to himself and put all his agony and desire into it,
clutching tightly the useless bit of matter meanwhile, and the two
Ministers watched him with rather obvious patience.<Node id="431580" /> <Node id="431581" />At last he stirred,
put it down, and stood up.<Node id="431627" />

<Node id="431629" />'<Node id="431630" />It seems I can do no more,' he said.<Node id="431666" /> '<Node id="431668" />I will go back to Rich and tell
them that there is no hope.<Node id="431727" />'<Node id="431728" />

<Node id="431730" />'<Node id="431731" />A great pity,' Lord Birlesmere said, speaking for the first time; and
'A very great pity,' said Mr. Garterr Browne, adding, both to create
a good impression and with an eye to any extremely improbable future
eventualities, 'Of course, if any fresh change should occur, if (for
example) it should be in any way _cyclic_, I pledge you my word to let
you know.<Node id="432088" /> <Node id="432089" />But I haven't much hope.<Node id="432113" /> <Node id="432114" />A most remarkable phenomenon--that it
should have reasonably aroused such hope.<Node id="432193" />'<Node id="432194" />

<Node id="432196" />'<Node id="432197" />A very common phenomenon--that the dying should hope for life,' said
the Mayor, and with one abrupt farewell went out.<Node id="432315" />

<Node id="432317" />'<Node id="432318" />And now,' Garterr Browne said, leaning across his table towards
Birlesmere, '_now_ for Tumulty.<Node id="432413" />'<Node id="432414" />

<Node id="432416" />The Foreign Secretary in turn leant a little forward, so that to
observant eyes, perhaps to Lord Arglay's, the two might have seemed,
as they bowed towards each other across the office table and the mock
stone, like two figures of cherubim bowing over another Ark than that
which was in the Temple of Suleiman, and over the false treasures of
an illusory world.<Node id="432777" /> <Node id="432778" />The light of the Shekinah was hidden, but there
was something of a light in Mr. Garterr Browne's eyes as he said,
'Birlesmere, now we've got rid of him, now he's been worked, is
there any reason why _we_ shouldn't have it'--he dropped his voice
a little--'and stick to it?<Node id="433050" /> <Node id="433051" />You and I and Sheldrake if we must, and
Tumulty to experiment?<Node id="433113" /> <Node id="433114" />It may be able to do very great things.<Node id="433153" /> <Node id="433154" />Life--for
all we know; and gold--for all we know; and control.<Node id="433216" />'<Node id="433217" />

<Node id="433219" />Lord Birlesmere paled a little, but he also had felt during the last
few days a small and strange desire moving in his heart, and he did not
dispute with his colleague.<Node id="433387" /> <Node id="433388" />He only said, 'Can it be done?<Node id="433418" />'<Node id="433419" />

<Node id="433421" />'<Node id="433422" />Let us talk to Tumulty,' Mr. Garterr Browne answered and took up the
telephone.<Node id="433501" />

<Node id="433503" />It was, however, much later in the evening before Sir Giles could be
got hold of.<Node id="433584" /> <Node id="433585" />He had that day been again to Wandsworth considering the
detestable bed where the living and broken victim of his experiment lay,
sustained against all likelihood in a dreadful mortality by the rigorous
operation of the Stone.<Node id="433811" /> <Node id="433812" />He had then proceeded to a hospital where he
proposed to institute a series of experiments to see how far health
could be restored or abolished, and to note the effect of the Stone upon
bodies in a state of disease, and he had made arrangements to visit a
madhouse on the next day, where among the merely imbecile he hoped to be
able to measure the degree of personal will necessary for any working.<Node id="434211" />
<Node id="434212" />He was consequently both tired and snappy when the Home Secretary began
talking, and shut down on the conversation in a few minutes.<Node id="434344" />

<Node id="434346" />'<Node id="434347" />It's always the same damnable chit-chat,' he muttered, as he went up
to his bedroom and flung his Type on a table by the bed.<Node id="434472" /> '<Node id="434474" />Always this
infernal control.<Node id="434503" /> <Node id="434504" />I'd control _them_ fast enough if I could.<Node id="434546" /> <Node id="434547" />If I could
get past whatever sailor's knot the thing tied itself into the other day
when I wanted to try it on that bitch of Arglay's.<Node id="434681" /> <Node id="434682" />Can't that hog-headed
paroquet of a Secretary have Arglay and her jailed for something or
other?<Node id="434778" /> <Node id="434779" />I can't get rid of a notion that she's peering over the blasted
thing at me.<Node id="434855" /> <Node id="434856" />Am I losing my nerve and beginning to see things?<Node id="434905" />' <Node id="434907" />He
had sat down, half-undressed, on the side of the bed, and in a sudden
outbreak of rage he picked up the Stone again.<Node id="435026" /> '<Node id="435028" />Damn you,' it was Chloe
whom he half-unconsciously apostrophized, 'are you tucked away in it as
if it was Arglay's bed?<Node id="435147" /> <Node id="435148" />I only wish I could get at you.<Node id="435179" />'<Node id="435180" />

<Node id="435182" />As he spoke the Stone seemed to open in his hand.<Node id="435231" /> <Node id="435232" />He found himself
looking into it, down coils of moving and alternated splendour and
darkness.<Node id="435325" /> <Node id="435326" />Startled, he dropped it on the table, or would have done, but
that, as he loosed it, instead of falling, it hung in the air, dilating
and deepening.<Node id="435474" /> <Node id="435475" />It was no more a mere Stone, it moved before him as a
living thing, riven in all its parts by a subdued but increasing light.<Node id="435600" />
<Node id="435601" />He sprang up and took a step or two away, nor did it pursue, but he
somehow found himself no farther off.<Node id="435706" /> <Node id="435707" />He backed, cursing, to the extreme
other side of the room, but there once more he found himself close to
what had by now become a nucleus of movement which passed outward from
it into the very walls and furniture.<Node id="435920" /> <Node id="435921" />They, so far as the mind which was
now striving to steady itself, could discern, were themselves shifting
and curving.<Node id="436039" /> <Node id="436040" />He put out his hand to the bed and found himself holding
the cord of one of the pictures; he stepped aside, and one foot was
on the pillows of the bed and one crashing through the glass of the
wardrobe.<Node id="436242" /> '<Node id="436244" />The damn thing'll get me down if I'm not careful,' he
thought, and made a great effort to hold himself firm, and see in its
natural shape the room he knew so well.<Node id="436407" /> <Node id="436408" />But, whether within or without,
the awful change went on; it was as if the room itself, and he with it,
were being sucked into the convolutions of the Stone.<Node id="436565" /> <Node id="436566" />Its darkness and
its light were no more merely before him but expanding upwards and
downwards till they rose to his head and descended to his feet; he felt
himself drawn against all his efforts into some unnaturally curved
posture--he knew of pain somewhere but could not keep his mind on it.<Node id="436858" />
<Node id="436859" />For before him in arch after arch, as if veil after veil were torn
swiftly aside, that which was the Stone was opening its heart to him.<Node id="436995" />
<Node id="436996" />His eyes could not properly see, nor his brain understand, what those
swift revelations held; he thought once or twice he saw himself, he was
sure he caught sight of Lord Arglay moving in some abstracted meditation
upon some serious concern.<Node id="437237" /> <Node id="437238" />And then suddenly he saw her; he saw her
lying in bed asleep, far off but very clear, and felt himself beginning
to be entirely drawn down the long spiral passages through which he
gazed.<Node id="437425" /> <Node id="437426" />He set, in one last gigantic effort, his whole will against this
movement, and for a moment seemed to stay it.<Node id="437536" /> <Node id="437537" />So clear was the vision
that he saw Chloe stir and turn a little in her sleep.<Node id="437615" /> <Node id="437616" />In a suddenly
renewed rage he felt himself cry out at her, 'O go to hell,' and as the
words, from within or without, reached his mind, Chloe stirred again and
woke.<Node id="437780" /> <Node id="437781" />He saw her wake; his eyes met hers; he saw them but saw in them
no recognition--not of horror or anger or fear; nor indeed of pity or
mercy or distress.<Node id="437933" /> <Node id="437934" />She looked at him through the distances, and as if
unconsciously put a hand beneath her pillow.<Node id="438029" /> <Node id="438030" />And as she did so the
vision passed and he saw her no more.<Node id="438089" />

<Node id="438091" />For now, and now that sense of pain in his limbs grew stronger, he saw
That which had lain beneath her pillow; within the Stone he saw the
Stone.<Node id="438236" /> <Node id="438237" />Not in the sense of which the Hajji had spoken or Lord Arglay
had talked to Chloe, but for him more agonizingly the way to the Stone
lay indeed within the Stone.<Node id="438398" /> <Node id="438399" />Its greatness was all about him, yet its
smallness lay, glowing gold, at the remote centre.<Node id="438490" /> <Node id="438491" />There was something
or someone behind and partly above it, and below in a fiery circle of
guardianship he saw figures that seemed each to wear it in ring or
crown, in swordhilt or sceptre, and then the Stone in the centre changed
and was the Stone no more.<Node id="438747" />

<Node id="438749" />For whatever brooded over it had moved, and at the movement the light
leaped out at him, and suddenly Giles Tumulty began to scream.<Node id="438881" /> <Node id="438882" />For at
once the light and with it the pain passed through him, dividing nerve
from nerve, sinew from sinew, bone from bone.<Node id="439005" /> <Node id="439006" />Everywhere the sharp
torment caught him, and still, struggling and twisting, he was dragged
down the curving spirals nearer to the illumination into which he was
already plunged.<Node id="439184" /> <Node id="439185" />And he remembered--now suddenly he remembered how he
had seen in a vision what was to be.<Node id="439274" /> <Node id="439275" />He had willed to be in the future,
and since that could not be, for the future as yet had lain only in the
Mind to which it equally with the past was present, the Stone had
revealed the future to him.<Node id="439475" /> <Node id="439476" />He remembered; he knew what was to happen,
for the merciful oblivion was withdrawn; he saw himself gathered, a
living soul, into the centre of the Stone.<Node id="439629" /> <Node id="439630" />That which he had been to
men, that by which he had chosen to deal with others, by that he was to
be dealt with in his turn.<Node id="439754" /> <Node id="439755" />The wheeling and looming forms of giant
powers amid whom he was drawn turned on him their terrible and curious
eyes; under the gaze of everlasting dominations he was exposed in a
final and utter helplessness.<Node id="439963" /> <Node id="439964" />He was conscious also of a myriad other
Giles Tumultys, of childhood and boyhood and youth and age, all that he
had ever been, and all of them were screaming as that relentless and
dividing light plunged into them and held them.<Node id="440192" /> <Node id="440193" />He was doing, it seemed,
innumerable things at once, all the things that he had ever done, and
yet the whole time he was not doing, he was slipping, slipping down, and
under and over him the Glory shone, and sometimes it withdrew a little
and then pierced him again with new agony.<Node id="440474" /> <Node id="440475" />And now he was whirling round
and round, having no hold above or footing below, but being lost in
an infinite depth.<Node id="440591" /> <Node id="440592" />Above him the light was full of eyes, curious and
pitiless, watching him as he had often watched others, and a subtle
murmur, as of some distant words of comment or of subdued laughter came
to him.<Node id="440789" /> <Node id="440790" />From the spirals of time and place he felt himself falling, and
still he fell and fell.<Node id="440877" />

<Node id="440879" />When they found him, but a few moments after that raucous scream had
terrified the household, he was lying on the floor amid the shattered
furniture twisted in every limb, and pierced and burnt all over as if by
innumerable needle-points of fire.<Node id="441125" />




<Node id="441130" />CHAPTER XVII<Node id="441142" />

<Node id="441144" />THE JUDGEMENT OF LORD ARGLAY<Node id="441172" />


<Node id="441175" />Twenty-four hours after his theft, Frank Lindsay had begun to realize
that the emotions which accompany possession are sometimes as hard to
deal with as the difficulties which precede possession.<Node id="441370" /> <Node id="441371" />Before he had
had the Stone in his pocket he had seen quite clearly what he would do;
he would divide it, keep one part, and pass the other on to Mr. Merridew
in return for a fee.<Node id="441550" /> <Node id="441551" />That two identical Stones would result from the
division he had not understood, only that each part of a divided Stone
possessed the virtues of the whole.<Node id="441705" /> <Node id="441706" />But he found that such a proceeding
was by no means easy.<Node id="441763" /> <Node id="441764" />His irritation with Chloe had prepared the way for
his desire of success in his examination, winged by the promised fee,
to pass into action; but when action was for the moment over, he found
the second step more difficult than the first.<Node id="442002" /> <Node id="442003" />He had been squeezed by
circumstances and a narrow chance into the first act, but time opened
before him for the second, and he could not move.<Node id="442146" /> <Node id="442147" />He continually found
himself staring at the Stone; he continually fingered his pocket-knife,
and even took it out and opened it.<Node id="442275" /> <Node id="442276" />But he could not put the edge to its
work.<Node id="442318" />

<Node id="442320" />For one thing the Stone itself surprised him.<Node id="442365" /> <Node id="442366" />He had not understood
from Chloe--and for a good reason, since at that time she had not made
herself a path for the Will of the Stone, and the Light within it had
not expanded in proportion--that it was so strange, so active, and even
so terrible an object.<Node id="442623" /> <Node id="442624" />He was--he had to admit--frightened of touching
it; he felt as if it would bleed at a cut and pour out its life before
him.<Node id="442747" /> <Node id="442748" />He hesitated even to touch it; it looked sometimes as if it would
burn him if he lifted it.<Node id="442839" /> <Node id="442840" />On the other hand, he could not bring himself
to part entirely in his mind from Chloe by passing it on to Mr. Merridew
in its completeness.<Node id="442979" /> <Node id="442980" />He thought of ringing Carnegie up and refrained;
vaguely it seemed to him that Chloe might, she _might_, be willing to
lend him one of them if he didn't.<Node id="443133" /> <Node id="443134" />After all, she might take another
view of his needs even now, even if she found out; but he realized that
if she found out that it had passed to Merridew, his own days would be
short in her land.<Node id="443329" /> <Node id="443330" />And at that he began to realize that he was very near
finding Chloe indispensable to him, or (as he called it) loving her.<Node id="443452" /> <Node id="443453" />He
didn't want her to leave him, and while he had the Stone (he thought
hopefully, in the manner of lovers of the sort) he could bribe, or lure,
or bully her into nearness.<Node id="443625" /> <Node id="443626" />The idea had occurred to him in the night,
and he took it with him to the offices where he worked, and his own
small room.<Node id="443748" />

<Node id="443750" />The only difficulty in the way of re-establishing relations with Chloe
while retaining the Stone was the explanation of how he had got it.<Node id="443888" /> <Node id="443889" />He
hardly saw himself saying to her, 'I have stolen this from you, and I
want to use it.<Node id="443977" /> <Node id="443978" />But if you are very nice to me I will not give it to
anyone else, though I might make a hundred or two by doing so.<Node id="444093" /> <Node id="444094" />I will,
that is, buy you with a hundred pounds and the preservation in my
own hands of your property.<Node id="444195" />' <Node id="444197" />The nearest he got to saying that even
to himself was to recollect that she had occasionally, in times of
financial stress, jested, half-mockingly, half-grimly, on the amount for
which she would sell herself.<Node id="444405" /> <Node id="444406" />But he realized that anyone who offered
five pounds, or indeed five pence, would stand a better chance than he
himself coming with such a bargain.<Node id="444552" /> <Node id="444553" />Besides, of course, he didn't want
her to sell herself; he wanted her to love him--in exchange for his loss
of a hundred pounds and his promise only to use the Stone for his own
purposes.<Node id="444740" />

<Node id="444742" />It was at that moment she arrived, following up an office-boy, who just
had time to say, 'Miss Burnett to see you,' before he was dazzled out of
the way by her smile as she passed.<Node id="444922" /> <Node id="444923" />The smile vanished as she shut the
door behind her; she turned on the wretched, goggling, and gasping Frank
a face which he had never seen before.<Node id="445069" /> <Node id="445070" />Chloe laughing, Chloe irritable,
Chloe impatient, Chloe affectionate, Chloe attentive, Chloe provocative,
these and many another he had known--but this, this was hardly Chloe.<Node id="445245" /> <Node id="445246" />It
was not that she looked angry or harsh; there was rather in her face a
largeness of comprehension, a softness of generosity and lovely haste to
meet any approach, which bewildered him.<Node id="445433" />

<Node id="445435" />'<Node id="445436" />Dear Frank,' she said, tenderly, 'how silly of you!<Node id="445487" />'<Node id="445488" />

<Node id="445490" />Frank went on goggling.<Node id="445513" /> <Node id="445514" />She added simply, 'I couldn't come yesterday
because Lord Arglay was away till very late, and I didn't like to leave
it while he had told me to stop.<Node id="445663" /> <Node id="445664" />Not that it mattered.<Node id="445685" /> <Node id="445686" />So I had to come
here.<Node id="445708" />' <Node id="445710" />She smiled at him.<Node id="445728" /> '<Node id="445730" />Darling,' she added, 'you were rather rash,
weren't you?<Node id="445786" /> <Node id="445787" />and a little rude?<Node id="445805" />'<Node id="445806" />

<Node id="445808" />Frank's mind tried vainly to understand.<Node id="445848" /> <Node id="445849" />He was being accused--it must
in the circumstances surely be an accusation?<Node id="445924" /> <Node id="445925" />what could she do except
ask, or appeal, or accuse?<Node id="445976" /> <Node id="445977" />Only this didn't sound like any of the three;
it was more like sympathy.<Node id="446049" /> <Node id="446050" />But if he were being accused, it was of a
breach of manners and not of morals, which put him at a disadvantage,
since the second can be defended on the grounds of some better, or
at least different, morality, but the first is a matter of taste and
defence is only communicable by emotion.<Node id="446338" /> <Node id="446339" />Of her emotions at the moment
he was altogether ignorant.<Node id="446396" />

<Node id="446398" />'<Node id="446399" />Rude?<Node id="446404" />' <Node id="446406" />he said, 'rude?<Node id="446421" /> <Node id="446422" />What do you mean--rude?<Node id="446445" />'<Node id="446446" />

<Node id="446448" />'<Node id="446449" />Well ...<Node id="446457" />' <Node id="446459" />Chloe sketched a gesture.<Node id="446484" /> '<Node id="446486" />You might have asked me again
first if you needed it so much.<Node id="446547" />'<Node id="446548" />

<Node id="446550" />Whether this subtlety was from the Stone or from her own feminine mind
was hidden at the place where the Stone and her mind were finding their
union.<Node id="446699" /> <Node id="446700" />The only answer of which Frank was capable was criticism in turn.<Node id="446765" />

<Node id="446767" />'<Node id="446768" />I did ask you,' he said, 'and you wouldn't....<Node id="446814" /> <Node id="446815" />But anyhow, I don't
know...<Node id="446842" />'<Node id="446843" />

<Node id="446845" />He could not finish.<Node id="446865" /> <Node id="446866" />Her swift and luminous eyes prevented him, passing
in front of him with what shone in them, as they turned his excuses and
denials aside, like a new and overwhelming mastery and knowledge.<Node id="447054" /> <Node id="447055" />She
came lightly to him and paused.<Node id="447090" />

<Node id="447092" />'<Node id="447093" />Will you give it back to me?<Node id="447121" />' <Node id="447123" />she said simply and stretched out her
hand.<Node id="447166" />

<Node id="447168" />In the stress of the moment he almost did.<Node id="447210" /> <Node id="447211" />They had, they had been
friends, great friends.<Node id="447258" /> <Node id="447259" />They had had good times together; she had mocked
and teased and helped and liked him; their hands and their mouths, their
voices and their glances, were familiar.<Node id="447421" /> <Node id="447422" />All but the sovereign union had
been theirs, and if, for Chloe, that sovereign union had by now been
made with other worlds, and if its image and instrument in this world
lay between her and her other friend and master, yet of these things
Frank was ignorant.<Node id="447681" /> <Node id="447682" />And since assuredly that full and sovereign union
permits no exclusion of any beauty, since the august virtue of its
nature is to receive into itself all which partakes of its own divine
benignity, since there--and there alone--is neither one nor many,
neither lesser nor greater, but all is perfect and free, since even in
its reflections upon earth the marvellous liberty of the children of God
is to be experienced by all who devoutly and passionately desire, then
even at that single moment Frank Lindsay might have entered into its
sweetness and strength could he have met her as she came, and answered
her in such a voice as that in which she asked.<Node id="448337" /> <Node id="448338" />But such a voice can
carry no selfish complaint, no wrangling excuse; it is a sound which,
native to heaven, can on earth be vocal and audible only between spirits
already disposed to heaven.<Node id="448529" /> <Node id="448530" />So disposed, for all of clumsiness or
roughness or anger or haste or folly that needed still to be cleared and
enlightened, she stood and faced him.<Node id="448678" /> <Node id="448679" />So indisposed, for all of industry
and care and thought and study, he stood and looked away.<Node id="448771" />

<Node id="448773" />'<Node id="448774" />Give what back?<Node id="448789" />' <Node id="448791" />he mumbled.<Node id="448802" />

<Node id="448804" />She sighed a little, and a faint shadow came upon her.<Node id="448858" /> <Node id="448859" />She dropped her
hand and said gravely, 'Will you give me back the Stone that you have
taken?<Node id="448951" />'<Node id="448952" />

<Node id="448954" />Between denial and excuse he hesitated; then, abandoning both, he began,
'Chloe, I don't think you quite understand----'<Node id="449074" />

<Node id="449076" />'<Node id="449077" />Need I understand more?<Node id="449100" />' <Node id="449102" />she asked.<Node id="449112" />

<Node id="449114" />'<Node id="449115" />It's like this----' he began again, and again she checked him.<Node id="449177" />

<Node id="449179" />'<Node id="449180" />There is no need,' she said, and then more swiftly, 'Frank, dear Frank,
will you do this?<Node id="449269" />'<Node id="449270" />

<Node id="449272" />He made another effort, letting go the pretence of ignorance.<Node id="449333" /> '<Node id="449335" />Are _you_
asking me to?<Node id="449358" />' <Node id="449360" />he said.<Node id="449368" /> '<Node id="449370" />I mean, do _you_ want it?<Node id="449395" />'<Node id="449396" />

<Node id="449398" />'<Node id="449399" />No,' she said, and ceased.<Node id="449425" />

<Node id="449427" />'<Node id="449428" />But if you don't want it, then why....<Node id="449466" /> <Node id="449467" />I mean, mightn't it as well be
here--or even----' He was a little disappointed by her negative, and yet
uncertain of the wisdom of introducing Merridew.<Node id="449619" />

<Node id="449621" />'<Node id="449622" />It does not matter much where it is, I think,' she said, and again
affection broke into her voice as she said, 'I'm not asking for it; I'm
asking you.<Node id="449772" />'<Node id="449773" />

<Node id="449775" />'<Node id="449776" />You're asking me for it,' he said intelligently.<Node id="449824" />

<Node id="449826" />'<Node id="449827" />No,' she answered again.<Node id="449851" /> '<Node id="449853" />I am asking you to restore it, if you will,
before----'<Node id="449908" />

<Node id="449910" />'<Node id="449911" />Before?<Node id="449918" />' <Node id="449920" />he asked, really startled.<Node id="449946" /> <Node id="449947" />Surely Arglay, surely she, couldn't
be thinking of the police!<Node id="450009" /> <Node id="450010" />Curiously enough, he had never thought of
the police until now.<Node id="450073" /> <Node id="450074" />But she wouldn't, she couldn't, not with him!<Node id="450119" /> <Node id="450120" />And
Arglay couldn't be such a cad.<Node id="450154" />

<Node id="450156" />'<Node id="450157" />Before'--for the first time she faltered--'I don't know; perhaps
before it is restored.<Node id="450244" /> <Node id="450245" />But that doesn't matter; only I can't wait.<Node id="450288" /> <Node id="450289" />Lord
Arglay is expecting me; he let me come because he knew I wanted to, but
I can't wait.<Node id="450379" /> <Node id="450380" />Frank, if you have liked what we have had, you and I, will
you give me back the Stone?<Node id="450466" />'<Node id="450467" />

<Node id="450469" />'<Node id="450470" />It isn't that I wouldn't--soon,' Frank answered.<Node id="450518" />

<Node id="450520" />'<Node id="450521" />Will you now?<Node id="450534" />' <Node id="450536" />she asked.<Node id="450546" />

<Node id="450548" />'<Node id="450549" />I think we ought to talk it over a little,' he said defensively.<Node id="450613" /> '<Node id="450615" />I
think you ought to try and get my point of view.<Node id="450665" /> <Node id="450666" />I think I----'<Node id="450680" />

<Node id="450682" />She moved away and walked, a little sadly, to the door.<Node id="450737" /> <Node id="450738" />There she paused
and looked back.<Node id="450771" /> '<Node id="450773" />Thank you for everything you have done for me,' she
said.<Node id="450830" /> '<Node id="450832" />They were good times.<Node id="450853" /> <Node id="450854" />Good-bye, darling.<Node id="450872" />'<Node id="450873" />

<Node id="450875" />He began to stammer some further explanation, but she was gone, and he
stood alone with an emptiness and an uncertain fear invading his heart.<Node id="451017" />
<Node id="451018" />In his haste, when she had entered, he had flung his morning paper over
the Stone, which had been lying on the table, and now he moved that
away, and again looked at the thing which he had denied her.<Node id="451218" /> <Node id="451219" />He thought
uncertainly of the examination, and unpleasantly of Mr. Merridew;
of course, if she really wanted--It was a long while before, still
disturbed, but still following the way he had begun to tread, he rang up
Carnegie at the Union offices.<Node id="451466" /> <Node id="451467" />Nor even then had he ventured to divide
the Stone; he would talk to them first.<Node id="451546" />

<Node id="451548" />Carnegie, a cheque in his pocket, and the General Secretary's urgent
instructions in his mind, arrived as quickly as possible, and as quickly
as possible cut short Frank's talk, and procured the exhibition of the
Stone.<Node id="451767" /> <Node id="451768" />He agreed to every condition Frank made about having it
returned--or a part of it--for the examination, passed over the cheque,
picked up a spare envelope, slipped the Stone into it, put it down for a
moment on the table again, and slapped Frank on the shoulder.<Node id="452030" />

<Node id="452032" />'<Node id="452033" />Good man!<Node id="452042" />' <Node id="452044" />he said.<Node id="452052" /> '<Node id="452054" />Merridew will be frightfully bucked, and you may
find he can be useful to you yet.<Node id="452136" /> <Node id="452137" />He will if he can after this.<Node id="452166" /> <Node id="452167" />Well, I
must get back at once.<Node id="452197" /> <Node id="452198" />On the twenty-third you want it then?<Node id="452235" />'<Node id="452236" />

<Node id="452238" />He grinned cheerfully at Frank, moved to pick up the packet, and looked
vaguely at the table.<Node id="452331" /> '<Node id="452333" />Where----' he began, picked up an empty envelope,
the only one in sight, and said with some sharpness, 'Where the devil is
it?<Node id="452459" />'<Node id="452460" />

<Node id="452462" />They both looked, they separated and sorted papers, they searched table
and floor, they looked inside the envelope a dozen times, and still the
Stone was undiscoverable.<Node id="452631" />

<Node id="452633" />'<Node id="452634" />What's the idea?<Node id="452650" />' <Node id="452652" />Carnegie asked.<Node id="452667" /> '<Node id="452669" />Is this a joke?<Node id="452684" />'<Node id="452685" />

<Node id="452687" />'<Node id="452688" />Don't talk rubbish,' Frank answered sharply.<Node id="452732" /> '<Node id="452734" />Did you put it in your
pocket?<Node id="452764" />'<Node id="452765" />

<Node id="452767" />It seemed not, though the cheque had remained in Frank's.<Node id="452824" /> <Node id="452825" />Carnegie
searched, threatened, expostulated; Frank, maddened by an implied
accusation of a theft of money, snapped, and later raged.<Node id="452957" /> <Node id="452958" />They searched
and quarrelled; they hunted and denounced.<Node id="453014" /> <Node id="453015" />And for all their effort and
anger and perplexity, the Stone of the King was not to be found.<Node id="453108" />

<Node id="453110" />But while Frank had, after her departure, still been standing, dimly
puzzled and unhappy, Chloe had been on her way back to Lancaster Gate,
back to the Hajji and Lord Arglay and the Unity in the Stone.<Node id="453311" /> <Node id="453312" />All
the previous afternoon she had watched it, or--to the best of her
power--prayed, or meditated, or talked or listened to that foreign
doctor of the mysteries.<Node id="453473" /> <Node id="453474" />The realization of the theft of her Type had
caused that which remained to seem very precious to her; the thought
of the attempt in her room and of the death of Reginald Montague had
brought the sense of necessary action very close, but she did not yet
see what that action was to be.<Node id="453758" /> <Node id="453759" />The Hajji had talked as if but one
stage had been reached; she had made an opportunity, he implied, for
the Stone, and the Indwelling of the Stone, to operate in the external
world, but there it could at best only heal and destroy and its place
was not there.<Node id="454018" /> <Node id="454019" />He would not formulate for her what more remained, and
she reposed now on the hope, the more than hope, that Lord Arglay and
the Stone would direct her.<Node id="454171" /> <Node id="454172" />Her unhappiness about Frank lay rather round
than in her; she saw it as a sadness rather than felt it as a sorrow,
for within she was withdrawn to an intention of obedience and a purpose
not yet unveiled.<Node id="454376" />

<Node id="454378" />She got out at the Tube station, smiled at the newspaper man, picked up
an agitated old lady's umbrella, threw a glance over the Park, and came
after a short walk to the house.<Node id="454554" /> <Node id="454555" />When she opened the study door she was
at first unobserved, for Lord Arglay was standing with his back to the
door listening to the Mayor of Rich.<Node id="454701" /> <Node id="454702" />At least, she supposed it must
be the Mayor, from what he was saying, and from Oliver Doncaster's
presence a few paces distant.<Node id="454829" /> <Node id="454830" />The Hajji was sitting close by.<Node id="454861" /> <Node id="454862" />The Stone,
infinitely precious, glowed upon the table.<Node id="454916" /> <Node id="454917" />On another smaller table
were her typewriter, her notebooks, one pile of ordered manuscript
which was the first few chapters of _Organic Law_, and another pile of
papers which were the notes and schemes and drafts and quotations and
references for the remainder.<Node id="455179" /> <Node id="455180" />She closed the door softly behind her and
for a minute or so stood and gazed.<Node id="455257" />

<Node id="455259" />Her gaze took in, it seemed, the symbols and instruments of her life,
but they were real things and she felt with increasing happiness that
what was there had, however hidden, run through her life.<Node id="455456" /> <Node id="455457" />The muddled,
distressed, amusing thing that her life had been resolved itself into
four things in that room--the manuscript, and Oliver Doncaster, and Lord
Arglay, and the Stone.<Node id="455635" /> <Node id="455636" />Whatever was coming, it was good, and she was
fortunate, that her work had entered into the Chief Justice's attempt
to formulate once more by the intellect the actions of men; she was
fortunate to have had even so small a part in the august labour.<Node id="455884" />
<Node id="455885" />Whatever was coming, it was good that all her transitory loves should
touch with so pleasant a glance as Oliver Doncaster's her renewed
entrance.<Node id="456030" /> <Node id="456031" />She remembered how she had thought of his hair, and with a
secret smile she assented--not in desire but in a happy amusement.<Node id="456156" /> '<Node id="456158" />The
dear!<Node id="456167" />' <Node id="456169" />she thought, caught his eyes, saw the admiration in them, preened
herself on it for a moment's joy, and looked on.<Node id="456283" /> <Node id="456284" />Of the Hajji and the
Mayor she felt little; they knew and did things, but they answered to
no need or capacity within her except as teachers or clients.<Node id="456436" /> <Node id="456437" />And of
Lord Arglay and of the Stone she could not think, only she hoped that,
whatever happened, neither of them would be lost to her for ever.<Node id="456580" />

<Node id="456582" />She took off her hat and coat, went and put them on her chair, and came
softly back.<Node id="456666" /> <Node id="456667" />The Mayor saw her and stopped.<Node id="456697" /> <Node id="456698" />Lord Arglay questioned her
with his eyes; she shook her head.<Node id="456759" /> <Node id="456760" />He nodded, and considered; then he
said:<Node id="456800" />

<Node id="456802" />'<Node id="456803" />It seems then, as the Hajji said yesterday, that there remains but this
Type.<Node id="456880" /> <Node id="456881" />And three of us are agreed that there is but one End.<Node id="456934" /> <Node id="456935" />But the
Hajji declares that there is but one Path also.<Node id="456990" />'<Node id="456991" />

<Node id="456993" />'<Node id="456994" />And what is that?<Node id="457011" />' <Node id="457013" />Chloe asked.<Node id="457025" />

<Node id="457027" />'<Node id="457028" />It is through the Restoration of the Stone,' the Hajji said, but before
he could add anything Lord Arglay went on, 'Only the Mayor here believes
that there is another Path, for having heard'--his little finger
indicated Oliver--'that we preserve the Stone he has come here to ask me
to use it for all sorts of good things.<Node id="457350" />'<Node id="457351" />

<Node id="457353" />'<Node id="457354" />But I thought,' Chloe said, 'that the Government----'<Node id="457407" />

<Node id="457409" />Lord Arglay allowed himself to smile.<Node id="457446" /> '<Node id="457448" />The Government,' he said, 'have
found that the Stone has unfortunately exhausted its powers.<Node id="457540" />'<Node id="457541" />

<Node id="457543" />'<Node id="457544" />What!<Node id="457549" />' <Node id="457551" />Chloe exclaimed.<Node id="457567" />

<Node id="457569" />The Hajji got up.<Node id="457586" /> '<Node id="457588" />It is the most horrible blasphemy,' he said.<Node id="457632" />

<Node id="457634" />'<Node id="457635" />Why, that may be so,' Lord Arglay said, 'though I can very well believe
that the stone they have produced is an exact presentation of the
feeling between Birlesmere and Garterr Browne.<Node id="457819" /> <Node id="457820" />So that even in such a
blasphemy the Justice of things is maintained.<Node id="457889" />'<Node id="457890" />

<Node id="457892" />'<Node id="457893" />But exhausted----?<Node id="457911" />' <Node id="457913" />Chloe asked, staring at the marvel which from its
place directed the movements of her heart.<Node id="458005" />

<Node id="458007" />'<Node id="458008" />O la la!<Node id="458016" />' <Node id="458018" />Lord Arglay answered, 'let us forget their tricks.<Node id="458068" />' <Node id="458070" />He too
looked at the Stone, and added, almost as if speaking to it, 'But what
can you expect, with such an Executive?<Node id="458187" />' <Node id="458189" />Then he went on, 'So the Mayor
has come to us, and he would have us do what we may with the Stone to
cure all the broken and diseased men in his city.<Node id="458339" />'<Node id="458340" />

<Node id="458342" />He paused, but Chloe only waited for him to proceed as (he thought) she
had so often done while he dictated the sentences of _Organic Law_.<Node id="458481" /> <Node id="458482" />He
went on.<Node id="458493" />

<Node id="458495" />'<Node id="458496" />And here therefore we are,' he said, 'wondering what path to follow.<Node id="458564" />
<Node id="458565" />For the Mayor and the Hajji disagree, and Mr. Doncaster and I have no
clear idea, and though doubtless the Stone knows very well it does not
give us much help.<Node id="458724" /> <Node id="458725" />What do you think?<Node id="458743" />'<Node id="458744" />

<Node id="458746" />She shook her head, and as she did so the Mayor broke once more into his
plea for those whom he sought to serve.<Node id="458858" /> <Node id="458859" />But after a while he stopped.<Node id="458888" />

<Node id="458890" />Lord Arglay said, 'All this is true and dreadful enough.<Node id="458946" /> <Node id="458947" />But even yet I
am not clear what should be done.<Node id="458995" />'<Node id="458996" />

<Node id="458998" />'<Node id="458999" />If you are afraid to act----' the Mayor cried out.<Node id="459049" />

<Node id="459051" />'<Node id="459052" />No,' Lord Arglay said, 'I do not think I am afraid.<Node id="459103" />'<Node id="459104" />

<Node id="459106" />'<Node id="459107" />Then divide the Stone,' the Mayor exclaimed, 'and let me have a part,
and do what you will with the other.<Node id="459213" />'<Node id="459214" />

<Node id="459216" />The Hajji made a movement, but Lord Arglay checked him with a hand, and
said, 'No, that I will not do; for I am still the Chief Justice--though
I cannot think I shall be so for very long--and it is not in my
judgement to commit any violence upon the Stone.<Node id="459472" />'<Node id="459473" />

<Node id="459475" />'<Node id="459476" />Then for God's sake say what you will do,' the Mayor cried out in pain,
'and put an end to it all.<Node id="459574" />'<Node id="459575" />

<Node id="459577" />Lord Arglay stood for a minute in silence, then he began to speak,
slowly and as if he gave judgement from his seat in the Court.<Node id="459706" />

<Node id="459708" />'<Node id="459709" />I think there are few among my predecessors,' he said, 'who have had
such a matter to decide, and that not by the laws of England or Persia
or any mortal code.<Node id="459868" /> <Node id="459869" />But God forbid that when even such a matter is set
before us we should not speak what we may.<Node id="459962" /> <Node id="459963" />For if this is a matter
of claimants then even those very terrible opposites shall abide the
judgement of the Court to which chance, or it may be something more than
chance, has brought them, as it was said in one of the myths of our race
that a god was content to submit to the word of the Roman law.<Node id="460264" /> <Node id="460265" />But it
is not in our habit to wash our hands of these things, whatever god or
people come before us.<Node id="460365" /> <Node id="460366" />Also this is a question, it seems, between God
and the people.<Node id="460428" /> <Node id="460429" />It is a very dreadful thing to refuse health to the
sick--but it is more tragic still to loose upon earth that which does
not belong to the earth, or if it does only upon its own conditions and
after its own mode.<Node id="460642" /> <Node id="460643" />Therefore I would not compel the Stone to act or ask
any grace from it that it did not naturally give.<Node id="460745" /> <Node id="460746" />And it is clear to us
at least since last night that this thing belongs only to itself.<Node id="460833" /> <Node id="460834" />So
that I say that it is necessary first that it may be offered again to
itself, but whether or how that may be done I do not yet know.<Node id="460969" /> <Node id="460970" />For of
all of us here one has sworn an oath and will keep it, and one claims
the Stone for his purposes, and two are unlearned in its way.<Node id="461108" /> <Node id="461109" />And
therefore there is but one Path for the Stone, and since she has made
herself that we will determine the matter so.<Node id="461228" />'<Node id="461229" />

<Node id="461231" />He looked at Chloe, and his voice changed.<Node id="461273" /> '<Node id="461275" />Are you to be the Path for
the Stone?<Node id="461312" />' <Node id="461314" />he said.<Node id="461322" />

<Node id="461324" />'<Node id="461325" />That is as you will have me,' Chloe answered.<Node id="461370" />

<Node id="461372" />'<Node id="461373" />Are you to be?<Node id="461387" />' <Node id="461389" />he asked, with a tender irony.<Node id="461419" /> '<Node id="461421" />Will you sit on the
throne of Suleiman, and of all those who have possessed the Stone, kings
and law-givers, Nimrod and Augustus and Muhammed and Charlemagne, will
you only restore it to its place?<Node id="461618" />'<Node id="461619" />

<Node id="461621" />Chloe flushed, and looked at him in distress.<Node id="461666" /> '<Node id="461668" />Am I being silly?<Node id="461685" />' <Node id="461687" />she
asked.<Node id="461697" /> '<Node id="461699" />I do not compare, I was only asking what you wanted me to do.<Node id="461760" />'<Node id="461761" />

<Node id="461763" />'<Node id="461764" />Be at peace,' he answered, 'for no man has yet measured his own work,
and it may be you shall do more than all these.<Node id="461881" /> <Node id="461882" />They laboured in their
office, and you shall work in yours.<Node id="461941" /> <Node id="461942" />But why will you have me tell you
what to do?<Node id="461987" />'<Node id="461988" />

<Node id="461990" />'<Node id="461991" />Because you said that the Stone was between us,' she answered, 'and if
that is so how otherwise can I move in the Stone?<Node id="462111" />'<Node id="462112" />

<Node id="462114" />'<Node id="462115" />And if I tell you to do it?<Node id="462142" />' <Node id="462144" />he asked.<Node id="462153" />

<Node id="462155" />'<Node id="462156" />Then I will do what I may,' Chloe said.<Node id="462195" />

<Node id="462197" />'<Node id="462198" />And if I tell you not to do it?<Node id="462229" />' <Node id="462231" />he asked again.<Node id="462246" />

<Node id="462248" />'<Node id="462249" />Then I will wait till you will have it done,' she said, 'for without
you I cannot go even by myself.<Node id="462349" />'<Node id="462350" />

<Node id="462352" />He looked at her in silence for a while, and as they stood there came
through the open window the shouting of the newspaper boys.<Node id="462481" /> '<Node id="462483" />More
Rioting at Rich,' they called, 'Official Statement.<Node id="462539" />' '<Node id="462542" />The Stone a Hoax.<Node id="462559" />'
'<Node id="462562" />Rumours of War in the East.<Node id="462589" />' '<Node id="462592" />Rumours of War ...<Node id="462610" /> <Node id="462611" />rumours of war.<Node id="462626" />'<Node id="462627" />

<Node id="462629" />Lord Arglay listened and looked.<Node id="462661" /> <Node id="462662" />Then, 'Well,' he said, 'whether I
believe I do not know and what I believe I most certainly do not know.<Node id="462766" />
<Node id="462767" />But it is either that or this.<Node id="462797" /> <Node id="462798" />And since this is in your mind I also
will be with your mind and I will take upon me what you desire.<Node id="462899" /> <Node id="462900" />So, if
there is indeed a path for the Stone, in the name of God let us offer
it that path, and let whatever Will moves justly in these things fulfil
itself through us if that is its desire.<Node id="463089" />' <Node id="463091" />He lifted up the Stone, kept
it for a moment raised upon his hand in the full view of all of them,
and held it a little out towards Chloe.<Node id="463229" /> '<Node id="463231" />Go on, child,' he said.<Node id="463254" />

<Node id="463256" />With the words there came to her the memory of her other experience in
that room, when in dream or vision she had heard some such voice
command her and struggled desperately to obey.<Node id="463438" /> <Node id="463439" />There was no struggle or
desperation in her movement or consciousness now as, so summoned, she
went forward and paused in front of him, holding out her joined hands
below his.<Node id="463614" /> <Node id="463615" />He lowered his own gently till it lay in the cup of hers, and
said in a voice shaken beyond his wont, 'Do you know what you must do?<Node id="463747" />'<Node id="463748" />

<Node id="463750" />She looked at him with a docile content.<Node id="463790" /> '<Node id="463792" />I have nothing at all to do,'
she said, and the Hajji cried suddenly aloud, 'Blessed for ever be the
Resignation of the elect.<Node id="463918" />'<Node id="463919" />

<Node id="463921" />'<Node id="463922" />Under the Protection,' Lord Arglay said, with the smile he had for her,
and, as she answered, in a voice that only he could hear, 'Under the
Protection,' he leaned his hand very gently so that, as if almost of its
own motion, the Stone rolled over into hers.<Node id="464180" /> <Node id="464181" />She received it, moving a
step or two backward till she stood a little apart from them.<Node id="464268" /> <Node id="464269" />The Hajji
broke into the Protestation of the Unity--'There is no God but God and
Muhammed is the Prophet of God.<Node id="464381" />'<Node id="464382" />

<Node id="464384" />The Mayor had turned half aside and had sat down, but he looked back now
at the figures before him.<Node id="464483" /> <Node id="464484" />Oliver Doncaster gazed with the ardent
worship of young love at Chloe, but he also was in the rear.<Node id="464583" /> <Node id="464584" />Upright,
attentive, providential, Lord Arglay maintained his place, and stood
nearest to her of all who watched.<Node id="464696" />

<Node id="464698" />She turned her eyes from his at last, downwards upon the Stone.<Node id="464761" /> <Node id="464762" />It lay
there, growing every moment more dark and more bright within itself;
it seemed larger than it had been, but they could not properly judge
because of the movement within it.<Node id="464941" /> <Node id="464942" />Chloe looked at it, and suddenly
there came into her mind the memory of Frank Lindsay.<Node id="465028" /> '<Node id="465030" />Poor darling,'
she felt with a renewed rush of pity and affection, 'he didn't, he
couldn't, understand.<Node id="465133" />' <Node id="465135" />In her own understanding she offered his failure
and his mischief to That which she held, and with him also (moved by a
large impulse which she endured without initiating, but with which she
gladly united herself) all those who for any purpose of good or evil had
laid their hands or fixed their desires upon the Stone.<Node id="465454" /> <Node id="465455" />Vague in image,
but intense in appeal, her heart gathered all--from herself to Giles
Tumulty--in a sudden presentation of them to the Mystery with which they
had trafficked.<Node id="465628" />

<Node id="465630" />Opposite her the eyes of Christopher Arglay had been watching it also.<Node id="465700" />
<Node id="465701" />But as, in the passion of her intercession, she raised her hands and
bent her head as if to carry the Stone into her breast and brood above
it there, his gaze slid along those arms to her form, and took in not
only that but the open window and the sky beyond.<Node id="465960" />

<Node id="465962" />He looked out, and in the sky itself there was a change.<Node id="466018" /> <Node id="466019" />There was
movement between him and the heavens; the chimneys and clouds and sky
took on the appearance of the Stone.<Node id="466135" /> <Node id="466136" />He was looking into it, and the
world was there, continents and cities, seas and their ships.<Node id="466229" /> <Node id="466230" />The Stone
was not these, yet these were the Stone--only there was movement within
and beyond them, and from a point infinitely far a continual vibration
mingled itself with the myriad actions of men.<Node id="466429" /> <Node id="466430" />And then, in the
foreground of that vastidity, he saw rising the Types of the Stone, here
and again there appearing and through all those mingled colours rushing
swiftly together.<Node id="466609" /> <Node id="466610" />Loosed from their cells and solitudes upon earth,
living suddenly in conjoining motion, closing within themselves the
separation which men had worked on them, those images grew into each
other and were again made one.<Node id="466827" /> <Node id="466828" />For a moment he saw the Unity of the
Stone at a great distance within the Stone which was the world, and then
the farther Mystery was lost in the nearer.<Node id="466981" /> <Node id="466982" />Colour and darkness were a
great background for her where she stood; they concentrated themselves
upon her; through her they poured into the Stone upon her hands, and
behind her again appeared but the sky and the houses of a London street.<Node id="467221" />

<Node id="467223" />The Hajji's voice called: 'Blessed be the Merciful, the Compassionate!<Node id="467293" />
<Node id="467294" />blessed!<Node id="467302" />' <Node id="467304" />and he got to his knees, immediately afterwards prostrating
himself towards the window, the East, and Mecca.<Node id="467412" /> <Node id="467413" />Moved by the action and
by some memory of churches and childhood, Oliver also knelt down; so
that of all those in the room only the figure of Lord Arglay remained
still upright and vigilant before her as the great change went on.<Node id="467642" />

<Node id="467644" />The strength of the appeal within her faded; it had achieved itself and
she was hastened to what remained in her will.<Node id="467762" /> <Node id="467763" />She became conscious of
the movement of her hands and her head, and stayed them, for they seemed
to suggest, however slightly, a removal and possession of the Stone.<Node id="467928" /> <Node id="467929" />Her
hands went a little from her, the Stone exposed upon them; they lifted a
little also, and her head was raised and thrown back.<Node id="468059" /> <Node id="468060" />But still her eyes
were upon it, and her will abolished itself before its own.<Node id="468138" /> <Node id="468139" />Where before
she had prayed 'Do or do not,' now she did not even pray.<Node id="468209" /> <Node id="468210" />Her thought
and her feeling passed out of her knowledge; she was the Path and there
was process within her, and that was enough.<Node id="468338" />

<Node id="468340" />It was not given to her--or to most of the others--to see the
operation by which that Mystery returned to its place.<Node id="468456" /> <Node id="468457" />For the Hajji's
eyes were hidden, and the Mayor still brooded over the needs of men and
was but half-attentive, and Oliver Doncaster's look was for Chloe rather
than the Stone.<Node id="468633" /> <Node id="468634" />Only the justice of Lord Arglay, in the justice of the
Stone which lay between himself and the woman he watched, beheld the
manifestation of that exalted Return.<Node id="468795" /> <Node id="468796" />He had seen the Types come
together and pass through her form, colouring but never confusing
it, till they had entered entirely into the Type upon her hands.<Node id="468953" /> <Node id="468954" />But
scarcely had the last vestige of entwined light and dark grown into the
One which remained, scarcely had he seen her in herself standing again
obedient and passive, than he saw suddenly that the great process was
reversing itself.<Node id="469188" /> <Node id="469189" />As all had flowed in, so now all began to flow out,
out from the Stone, out into the hands that held it, out along the arms
and into the body and shape of which they were part.<Node id="469365" /> <Node id="469366" />Through the clothes
that veiled it he saw that body receiving the likeness of the Stone.<Node id="469454" />
<Node id="469455" />Translucency entered it, and through and in the limbs the darkness which
was the Tetragrammaton moved and hid and revealed.<Node id="469578" /> <Node id="469579" />He saw the Mystery
upon her hands melting into them; it was flowing away, gently but very
surely; it lessened in size and intensity as he watched.<Node id="469725" /> <Node id="469726" />And as there
it grew less, so more and more exquisitely and finally it took its
place within her--what the Stone had been she now was.<Node id="469860" /> <Node id="469861" />Along that path,
offered it by one soul alone, it passed on its predestined way--one
single soul and yet one not solitary.<Node id="469983" /> <Node id="469984" />For even as she was changed into
its nature her eyes shone on her mortal master with an unchanged love
and in the Glory that revealed itself there was nothing alien to their
habitual and reciprocal joy.<Node id="470186" /> <Node id="470187" />The Stone that had been before them was
one with the Stone in which they had been; from either side its virtue
proclaimed itself in her.<Node id="470323" /> <Node id="470324" />At last the awful change was done.<Node id="470358" /> <Node id="470359" />She stood
before him; her hands, still outstretched, were empty, but within her
and about her light as of a lovely and clearer day grew and expanded.<Node id="470508" />
<Node id="470509" />No violent outbreak or dazzling splendour was there; a perfection of
existence flowed from her and passed outward so that he seemed both to
stand in it and to look on it with his natural eyes.<Node id="470701" /> <Node id="470702" />With such eyes
he saw also, black upon her forehead, as if the night corresponding
to that new day dwelled there for a while apart, the letters of the
Tetragrammaton.<Node id="470868" /> <Node id="470869" />She stood, so withdrawn, as the Stone sank slowly
through her whole presented nature to its place in the order of the
universe, and that mysterious visibility of the First Matter of creation
returned to the invisibility from which it had been summoned to dwell
in the crown of Suleiman the King.<Node id="471164" /> <Node id="471165" />As in the height of his glory the
Vicegerent of the Merciful One had sat, terrific and compulsive over
spirits and men, and the Stone had manifested above him, so now from
the hands stretched to grasp it and the minds plotting to use it,
from armies and conspiracies, greed and rapine, it withdrew through
a secluded heart.<Node id="471488" /> <Node id="471489" />She stood, and the light faded and the darkness
vanished; she stood, one moment clothed in the beauty of the End of
Desire, and then swiftly abandoned.<Node id="471640" /> <Node id="471641" />She was before him, the hands
stretched not to hold but to clasp, the eyes wide with an infinite
departure; she exclaimed and swayed where she stood, and Lord Arglay,
leaping to her as she fell, caught a senseless body in his arms.<Node id="471872" />




<Node id="471877" />CHAPTER XVIII<Node id="471890" />

<Node id="471892" />THE PROCESS OF ORGANIC LAW<Node id="471918" />


<Node id="471921" />Cecilia Sheldrake was always, everybody said, extraordinarily kind to
her husband, which may have been why he committed suicide some ten years
after the vanishing of the Stone.<Node id="472097" /> <Node id="472098" />No one quite believed, and very few
people understood, what her hints to her intimate, and indeed her less
intimate, friends exactly meant; that she and he had possessed some
marvellous thing by which anyone could go anywhere, and that, having
nearly lost it once in a motor-car, he had shortly afterwards entirely
lost it in her drawing-room.<Node id="472441" /> <Node id="472442" />She never reproached him, or not after the
first year or two, and even then never with the virulence of the first
week.<Node id="472561" /> <Node id="472562" />They had, people gathered, been looking together at whatever it
was--nobody remembered and nobody cared to remember, and then he had
mislaid it.<Node id="472706" /> <Node id="472707" />At least, for the first year or two he had mislaid it, and
after then nobody ever understood quite what he had done with it--sat on
it or swallowed it or sold or secreted it, according as it seemed to the
hearer most like an egg, a bon-bon, a curiosity, or a jewel.<Node id="472972" /> <Node id="472973" />But somehow
he had got rid of it, and Cecilia's life was ruined.<Node id="473037" /> <Node id="473038" />As, very justly, it
actually was--first, by the discontent which she perpetually nursed, and
secondly, by the drastic financial rearrangements which followed on her
husband's suicide.<Node id="473221" />

<Node id="473223" />Mr.<Node id="473226" /> <Node id="473227" />Garterr Browne, being unmarried, and having definitely himself
preserved the Type which he had had, found himself in the difficult
position of having nobody but himself to blame.<Node id="473405" /> <Node id="473406" />His position therefore
was so far worse than Mrs. Sheldrake's, and it was for a few months made
worse still by his having at odd times to deal with the doctors and
scientists whom he had summoned to report on his own substitute for the
Stone.<Node id="473648" /> <Node id="473649" />Fresh reports kept arriving for quite a long time from scientific
men of whom he had never heard, but who (with an indecently unselfish
ardour) kept on taking an interest in the remarkable cures at Rich and
their relation to the wretched fragment which Mr. Garterr Browne had
handed on to his earlier advisers and they had passed to their friends
who were interested.<Node id="474016" /> <Node id="474017" />Exactly how it was that he and Lord Birlesmere
could never afterwards be persuaded to take the same view on any
question, not even the Prime Minister, whose Government was twice
wrecked, ever properly understood.<Node id="474229" />

<Node id="474231" />Between those two politicians, between Sheldrake and his wife, between
Carnegie and Frank Lindsay, there lay continually suspicion, anger, and
hatred.<Node id="474381" /> <Node id="474382" />Negligent of them and their desires, the Mystery had left them
to their desires, and with those companions they lived.<Node id="474500" /> <Node id="474501" />For it was not
in the nature of the Stone to be forgotten, and even in her village Mrs.
Ferguson entertained her friends with the tale of her recovery rather
from an unappreciated love of it than because she was as talkative as
she seemed.<Node id="474740" />

<Node id="474742" />The Persian Embassy fell silent; Professor Palliser fell silent.<Node id="474806" /> <Node id="474807" />Only
one event caused a common flicker of satisfaction to rise in the hearts
of the professor, the millionaire, the thwarted General Secretary (who
never understood what the trouble had been about), and the politicians.<Node id="475026" />
<Node id="475027" />That event was the sudden resignation of his office by Lord Arglay.<Node id="475094" />

<Node id="475096" />For in the house at Lancaster Gate Chloe Burnett lay, uncomprehending
and semi-paralysed, for a long nine months of silence.<Node id="475220" /> <Node id="475221" />On the same day
when at Wandsworth the unhappy wreckage of a man passed into death, and
his bed lay empty, the wreckage of his saviour was carried to a bed in
the Chief Justice's house.<Node id="475406" /> <Node id="475407" />Her mouth was silent, her eyes were blank,
and that whole side of her which was not for ever still shook every now
and then with uncontrollable tremors.<Node id="475559" /> <Node id="475560" />The doctors stated that it was a
seizure, a verdict on which only once did Lord Arglay permit himself to
say that, whatever it was, it was precisely not that.<Node id="475718" /> <Node id="475719" />All the rest of
the time he maintained a silence--his secretary had been taken ill while
at work, and since apparently she had no relations and no friends with
a better claim, and since he felt that it was probably his fault for
overworking her, and since the house was large, it was better that she
should remain.<Node id="476033" /> <Node id="476034" />This was the general interpretation which Lord Arglay
allowed to arise.<Node id="476105" /> '<Node id="476107" />For if,' he said to the Hajji before the latter
returned to Persia, 'if we profess that this is the End of Desire, fewer
people than ever will want to experience it.<Node id="476272" />'<Node id="476273" />

<Node id="476275" />'<Node id="476276" />Her spirit is in the Resignation,' the Hajji said.<Node id="476326" />

<Node id="476328" />'<Node id="476329" />Quite,' Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="476358" /> '<Node id="476360" />So, you may have seen by this morning's
paper, is mine.<Node id="476415" /> <Node id="476416" />As entirely, but in another sphere.<Node id="476451" />'<Node id="476452" />

<Node id="476454" />'<Node id="476455" />Did you not hold,' the Hajji asked, 'that your office was also of the
Stone?<Node id="476531" />'<Node id="476532" />

<Node id="476534" />'<Node id="476535" />I have believed it,' Lord Arglay answered, 'but for one thing I will
not now make that office a personal quarrel between these men and
myself, though I think that otherwise even the Government would find it
difficult to turn me out.<Node id="476767" /> <Node id="476768" />But the Law is greater than the servants of
the Law, and shall I make the Law a privy garden for my own pride?<Node id="476878" /> <Node id="476879" />Also
since this child has come to such an end I will have none but myself, so
far as is possible, be her servant for the rest of her time.<Node id="477017" />'<Node id="477018" />

<Node id="477020" />'<Node id="477021" />I do not understand your mind,' Ibrahim said.<Node id="477066" /> '<Node id="477068" />Have you known and seen
these things and yet you do not believe in the Stone?<Node id="477145" />'<Node id="477146" />

<Node id="477148" />'<Node id="477149" />Who said I did not believe?<Node id="477176" />' <Node id="477178" />Lord Arglay asked.<Node id="477196" /> '<Node id="477198" />I believe that certain
things have emerged from illusion, and one of them I have resigned for
its sake and the other I will watch for hers.<Node id="477337" />'<Node id="477338" />

<Node id="477340" />'<Node id="477341" />You are a strange man,' the Hajji said.<Node id="477380" /> '<Node id="477382" />Farewell then, for I suppose
you will never be in Persia.<Node id="477439" />'<Node id="477440" />

<Node id="477442" />'<Node id="477443" />Do not despise us too much,' Lord Arglay said.<Node id="477489" /> '<Node id="477491" />It is our habit here to
mock at what we love and contemn what we desire, and that habit has
given us poets and lawgivers and saints.<Node id="477623" /> <Node id="477624" />Good-bye, Hajji.<Node id="477640" />'<Node id="477641" />

<Node id="477643" />'<Node id="477644" />The Mercy of the Compassionate be with you,' the Hajji said.<Node id="477704" />

<Node id="477706" />'<Node id="477707" />And even in that, for a reason, I will believe,' Lord Arglay answered,
and so they parted.<Node id="477797" />

<Node id="477799" />To Frank Lindsay Arglay sent a short note, saying nothing of the Stone
but only that Miss Burnett had suffered from--he paused and with a wry
smile wrote--a seizure, that she remained at Lancaster Gate, and that he
would at all times be very happy to see Mr. Lindsay there.<Node id="478072" /> <Node id="478073" />Frank however
did not come.<Node id="478100" /> <Node id="478101" />For a number of days he intended to answer the note, but
he could think of nothing to say that seemed adequate.<Node id="478212" /> <Node id="478213" />If Chloe wanted
to see him, he argued, she would send a special message; it was not his
business to intrude.<Node id="478321" /> <Node id="478322" />So safeguarding himself from that intrusion he
safeguarded himself also from any, and all that he might have known of
the conclusion of the Mystery was hidden from him.<Node id="478490" /> <Node id="478491" />He passed however a
not unsuccessful life in his profession, and the only intruder he found
himself unable to cope with was death.<Node id="478621" />

<Node id="478623" />But every few days through months Oliver Doncaster called and saw Chloe
and talked a little with Lord Arglay, and it was to him only that Arglay
on a certain day sent a note which read:<Node id="478808" />


    <Node id="478815" />'<Node id="478816" />MY DEAR DONCASTER,<Node id="478834" />

    <Node id="478840" />'<Node id="478841" />Chloe died yesterday evening.<Node id="478870" /> <Node id="478871" />The cremation will be on
    Thursday.<Node id="478909" /> <Node id="478910" />If you could call here about eleven we might go
    together.<Node id="478971" />
                                             '<Node id="479018" />Yours,
                                                  'ARGLAY.<Node id="479083" />'<Node id="479084" />


<Node id="479087" />There had been no change and no warning of that conclusion.<Node id="479146" /> <Node id="479147" />Whatever
process had been working in her body, since the day when her inner
being had been caught with the Stone into the Unity, closed quietly and
suddenly.<Node id="479304" /> <Node id="479305" />The purgation of her flesh accomplished itself, and it was by
apparent chance that Arglay was with her when it ceased.<Node id="479423" /> <Node id="479424" />He had paused
by the bedside before going to his own room next to hers for the night.<Node id="479509" />
<Node id="479510" />As he looked he saw one of those recurrent tremors shake her, but this
time it was not confined to one side but swept over the whole body.<Node id="479648" />
<Node id="479649" />From head to foot a vibration passed through her; she sighed deeply,
and murmured something indistinguishable.<Node id="479759" /> <Node id="479760" />So, on the moment, she died.<Node id="479788" />

<Node id="479790" />Arglay saw it and knew it for the end.<Node id="479828" /> <Node id="479829" />He made no immediate move
until he touched with his fingers the place where the epiphany of the
Tetragrammaton had appeared.<Node id="479953" /> '<Node id="479955" />Earth to earth,' he said, 'but perhaps
also justice to justice and the Stone to the Stone.<Node id="480045" />' <Node id="480047" />His hand covered
her forehead.<Node id="480077" /> '<Node id="480079" />Under the Protection,' he murmured.<Node id="480114" /> '<Node id="480116" />Good-bye, child,'
and so, his work at an end, left her.<Node id="480171" />

<Node id="480173" />In the car, as they returned from the crematorium, Oliver Doncaster said
to him, almost bitterly, 'Was it a wise thing to tell her to do it?<Node id="480313" />'<Node id="480314" />

<Node id="480316" />'<Node id="480317" />Why, who can tell?<Node id="480335" />' <Node id="480337" />Lord Arglay answered.<Node id="480358" /> '<Node id="480360" />But she sought for wisdom,
and what otherwise should such spirits as hers do upon earth?<Node id="480448" />'<Node id="480449" />

<Node id="480451" />'<Node id="480452" />She might have had love and happiness,' the young man said, 'and others
too.<Node id="480528" /> <Node id="480529" />There was always a light about her.<Node id="480564" />'<Node id="480565" />

<Node id="480567" />'<Node id="480568" />Why, so it seemed,' Lord Arglay said, and after a moment's pause,
looking out of the window of the car, he went on.<Node id="480683" /> '<Node id="480685" />But who can tell how
that light came to be?<Node id="480728" /> <Node id="480729" />It is but a few weeks since I gave sentence upon
a man before me who had murdered through some sudden jealousy the girl
he was to marry.<Node id="480865" /> <Node id="480866" />And when, as is the ritual, I asked him if he had
anything to say, he cried out that though I might hang him justly, for
he confessed his crime, yet that there was a Justice against which he
had sinned which was greater than I and had already purged him.<Node id="481120" /> <Node id="481121" />And
though I have never made it my habit to do as some of my brethren do,
offering their own moral opinions and the ethical and social rules of
their own world, and condemning the guilty by such verbiage as well as
by the law, I answered him that this also might be possible and that
such a Justice might already be fulfilled in him.<Node id="481454" /> <Node id="481455" />But if indeed there
be any such sovereign Justice, may not this child have found a greater
thing than either you or I could give her?<Node id="481588" /> <Node id="481589" />Could she do more, while she
was upon the stepping stones, than smile at the water that ran by her?<Node id="481688" />'<Node id="481689" />

<Node id="481691" />'<Node id="481692" />Must the water always run by?<Node id="481721" />' <Node id="481723" />Oliver said.<Node id="481735" />

<Node id="481737" />'<Node id="481738" />It is its nature, as it was hers to pass over it,' Lord Arglay
answered.<Node id="481810" /> '<Node id="481812" />And it may be that she has come into the light that was about
her and the God in whom we determined to believe.<Node id="481923" />'<Node id="481924" />

<Node id="481926" />At Lancaster Gate he bade Doncaster farewell, came again into his
study, and stood still to look round it.<Node id="482032" /> <Node id="482033" />His charge was at an end,
and for all he could tell there were still before him years of life.<Node id="482127" />
<Node id="482128" />Something must be done, and instinctively he looked at the MS.<Node id="482190" /> <Node id="482191" />of the
_Survey of Organic Law_ which had lain so long neglected, then he walked
over and picked it up.<Node id="482293" /> <Node id="482294" />The typewritten sheets bore in places his own
alterations and in places hers.<Node id="482371" /> <Node id="482372" />There were sheets of annotations she had
typed and sheets of references in her writing.<Node id="482459" /> <Node id="482460" />Lord Arglay looked at
them, and for a moment it seemed to him an offensive thing that another
handwriting should be mixed with theirs.<Node id="482594" /> <Node id="482595" />Yet after a moment he smiled:
to accept such a ruling would indeed be to go against the whole nature
of the Stone and the work they had done together.<Node id="482745" /> <Node id="482746" />For here was this
lesser work, and if it were worth doing--as it might be--and if without
someone to supply necessary detail it would probably not be done--was
not this also as much in the nature of organic law as the operation of
the Stone?<Node id="482987" />...<Node id="482990" />

<Node id="482992" />'<Node id="482993" />Besides,' Lord Arglay said aloud, 'in a year's time, child, I should
be finding an excuse.<Node id="483083" /> <Node id="483084" />I think I will not find an excuse.<Node id="483118" /> <Node id="483119" />The way to the
Stone is in the Stone, and I will choose to do this thing rather than to
leave it undone or to be driven back to it by the weariness of time.<Node id="483275" />'<Node id="483276" />

<Node id="483278" />He walked across to the telephone, looked at it distastefully, and
turned the pages of the directory.<Node id="483379" />

<Node id="483381" />With his hand on the receiver, 'Also,' he said, although the King wrote
Ecclesiastes, yet the Courts gave judgement in Jerusalem.<Node id="483510" /> <Node id="483511" />This, I
suppose, is Ecclesiastes....<Node id="483547" /> <Node id="483548" />Paddington 814....<Node id="483566" /> <Node id="483567" />Is that the Lancaster
Typewriting Agency?<Node id="483608" />'<Node id="483609" />

    Chesterton's earlier works, such as 'The Ball and the Cross,'
