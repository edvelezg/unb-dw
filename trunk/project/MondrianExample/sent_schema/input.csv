1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||60||This seems about as strong as external evidence need be.||NULL||0

1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||62||Further, it tells us that, besides the present opening scene, there were extant two different prologues, one of which was "quite prosy and perhaps concocted by the actors.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||63||This seems to show that the Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first time to collect the complete works of Euripides, some two centuries after his death, found this play current as "Euripides' _Rhesus_," but that it was credited with three different openings and that its style was felt to be somehow peculiar.||NULL||0

1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||68||Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet, naturally influenced by his great forerunners?||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||69||Hardly: because, with a few exceptions, the verse and diction of the _Rhesus_, are markedly early in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction direct and rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly relevant.||NULL||0

1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||71||If the _Rhesus_ is a post-classical play it can hardly be honest fourth-century work: it must be deliberately archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian spirit if not actually of the Alexandrian age.||NULL||0

1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||74||Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by accepting the external evidence as true.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||75||The famous critic, Crates, of the second century B.C., happens to mention--in excuse of what he took to be a slip in the poet's astronomy--that the _Rhesus_ of Euripides was a youthful work.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||76||Now the earliest dated tragedy of Euripides that we possess is the _Alcestis_, B.C. 438, written when he was about forty-six.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||77||His style may well have been considerably different fifteen or twenty years earlier, and must certainly have been much under the influence of Aeschylus.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||78||So far, so good.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||79||Then what of the other difficulties, the three different opening scenes and the few passages of late phrasing or technique?||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||80||One obvious explanation suits both.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||81||The three different openings pretty clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than once after the poet's death and adapted by the producer for each occasion.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||82||This happened to many plays of Euripides, and in one case we even know the name of the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of the poet.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||83||Among other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of the _Iphigenia in Aulis_.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||84||And in this connexion we can hardly help noticing that the _Iphigenia in Aulis_, like the _Rhesus_ and like no other Greek tragedy, has two alternative openings, one a dull prologue and one a lyrical scene in anapaests under the stars.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||85||The general style of the two plays is utterly different; the _Iphigenia_ is most typically late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had both passed at some time through the same revising hand.||NULL||0

1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||88||We have so far gone on the supposition that Euripides at twenty-five or thirty perhaps wrote very differently from Euripides at forty-six, and that the manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of his later life.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||89||There is nothing improbable in this suggestion, but have we any evidence?||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||90||Yes, a very little, and unfortunately it does not say what we want.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||91||We have some fragments--twenty lines altogether--preserved from the _Peliades_, with which Euripides won his first victory in the year 455, seventeen years before the _Alcestis_, and as far as they go they are just in his ordinary manner--a good deal more so, in fact, than much of the _Alcestis_ is.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||92||Let us face this difficulty.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||93||The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible, lucid, antithetic, studiously simple in vocabulary and charged with philosophic reflection.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||94||If we look in his extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of the _Rhesus_, which is comparatively terse, rich, romantic, not shrinking from rare words and strong colour and generally untinged by philosophy, we shall find the nearest approach to it in the _Cyclops_.||NULL||0
1913||Euripides||Rhesus [The Rhesus of Euripides]||murrayeuripides-rhesus-00-t.txt||95||Next to the _Cyclops_ I am not sure what play would come, but the _Alcestis_ would not be far off.||NULL||0
