On question three: The email you contacted is correct.  I'll send to the 
sales dept directly for you now.  Let me know if I can help further.  
Regarding the users and passwords, the installer creates a few sets of 
hardcoded username/password sets.  It is recommended that these be changed 
to better passwords once you go to Production.  

 

1) MySQL DB Credentials

  a) root/password             - this is the MySQL root DB user

  b) jasperdb/password    - this is the DB user used by JasperServer at runtime

  c) (Database name used for the JasperServer repository:  jasperserver)

 

2) JasperServer User Login Credentials

  a) jasperadmin/jasperadmin      - default administrative user

  b) joeuser/joeuser                         - default standard user (created if you choose to install Sample Data)
