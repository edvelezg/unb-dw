<Sentence>CHAPTER I‚ÄîThe Youngest of Six</Sentence>


<Sentence>Snow comes early and often in <Location>Grey County</Location>, <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>In 1873 it fell
heavily on October the twentieth, in thick wet blobs that sent the
cattle into the straw stacks to escape the driving storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
horse-power threshing machine at Robert Lowery‚Äôs farm, near
Chatsworth, was forced to give in to the storm at four o‚Äôclock in the
afternoon, and let the hands go home, because the sheaves were too wet
to go through the separator.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When young Will Mooney, who, though only fifteen was as good as a man,
and had been cutting bands all day, reached his home, on the Garafraxa
road, he was wet and cold and hungry, but the sight of the doctor‚Äôs
cutter at the front door drove out every sensation but one of extreme
anxiety and quickened his steps into a run.</Sentence> <Sentence>He opened the back door
softly, met by a rush of hot air, in which there was a trace of
carbolic acid and warming flannels and fresh bread.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Two of the neighbor women, Mrs. Edward Lowery and Mrs. Charlton were
in the kitchen, talking excitedly though in subdued tones; the matter
of the doctor was under discussion.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe did not need him,‚Äù said Mrs.
Lowery, ‚Äúand Mrs. Mooney did not want him.</Sentence> <Sentence>What is there for a doctor
to do in a perfectly natural birth?</Sentence> <Sentence>We brought her through before, and
could have done it again, a doctor is all right in case of a broken
arm or maybe scarlet fever, but an increase in the population is a
natural thing surely.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Her companion spoke up.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI gave him a look when he asked me if I had
scrubbed my hands in carbolic, I said, young man, we use soft soap
here, and we‚Äôve found it very good, and I may say, women have helped
each other here for a long time, and we have not lost a case yet.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
hope your record will be as good when you‚Äôve been here as long.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô‚Äù Then
they noticed that Will had come in, and motioned to him to be quiet.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIs mother sick?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he asked anxiously.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôll be worse before she is better,‚Äù Mrs. Lowery replied
mysteriously.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dumball is here now, your father brought him and it
will soon be over.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everything is all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>You are going to have a
little brother or sister, Willie.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Come over here to the stove,
and get off your wet shoe-packs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tish will get you dry clothes, you‚Äôre
soaked to the skin, I know.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tish, a fine young woman of twenty-one, who had been helping in the
kitchen for the last two months, produced a pair of dry socks from a
basket of clean clothes under the long table, and taking his overcoat
shook the snow off it, at the back door, and hung it in the passage.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then she went back to her bread, which was just ready for the oven.</Sentence> <Sentence>In
birth or death, or any other human upheaval, a batch of good light
bread never comes amiss.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIs mother very sick, Tish?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Will asked again.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBad enough, I guess,‚Äù Tish said, shoving a pan of bread into the high
oven, ‚Äúbut you know she never lets on.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was talking to her half an
hour ago; she said she thought you‚Äôd be home soon and to be sure and
get you to change your shirt too.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She felt his grey flannel shoulders.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs just a little damp‚Äîbut slip upstairs and put on a dry one,
she‚Äôll be asking.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI hope it is a boy,‚Äù Will said thoughtfully, when he came downstairs.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôve girls enough.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah, three years old, was sitting quietly in her high chair,
playing with a counter of colored beads, and took no notice of this
bit of brotherly candor.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIf it is as nice a little girl as Hannah, she‚Äôll be welcome,‚Äù Tish
remarked.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôs the best child I ever saw.</Sentence> <Sentence>She has been sitting there
for an hour; you‚Äôd think she knew.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the news broke with the shrill cry of the infant, uttering the
age-old protest, Will was somewhat taken back, and disappointed.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
was a girl!</Sentence>

<Sentence>He ran out to tell his father who was in the big barn flailing peas.</Sentence>

<Sentence>An hour later, Will was let in to see his mother, who lay in a high
four-poster bed, in the bedroom off the parlor.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He kissed her affectionately and asked her how she was feeling.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
told him to look behind her, and there in a new white shawl he saw a
wrinkled little face framed in jet black hair, with two small pink
fists doubled up beside its cheeks.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was sorry for his mother; she must be disappointed too, and it
wasn‚Äôt her fault, so he kissed her again, and told her it was all
right.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Irelands had three girls too, and the Charltons had four,
and maybe the next one would be a boy.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>My first memory is of a snowy afternoon too, one that seemed likely to
last forever.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had stationed myself on a stool in front of a window
and inside the lace curtain to watch for Lizzie, and Hannah and George
and Jack coming home from school.</Sentence> <Sentence>At first it was pleasant to watch
the snow making a pattern against the dark bulk of the barn, and
putting big white knobs on the fence posts, but my heart was too
burdened to see much beauty in anything.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had heard a bit of bad news!</Sentence> <Sentence>One of the neighbor girls, named
Hattie‚ÄîI forget her last name‚Äîcame over to borrow something, and I hid
behind the curtain when the dog barked a warning and I saw her coming.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I did not like Hattie, or any one of her unpalatable family, and for
the same reason.</Sentence> <Sentence>They kissed me every time they came in.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not only
kissed me but tried to make me bite my tongue by chucking me under the
chin.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I went into hiding when any of the tribe drew near.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hattie and mother talked without knowing I was in the room, and Hattie
said they were not going to have a Christmas tree this year, for
Zebbie had found out there was no Santa Claus and it was no fun now,
when there was no one who believed.</Sentence> <Sentence>These were her very words.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I thought mother would surely contradict her, but she didn‚Äôt.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I
made up my mind that I would wait right there to see what Lizzie, and
George and Jack and Hannah would say.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was afraid to ask
mother‚Äîafraid it was true‚ÄîI knew she would not withhold the truth, if
I asked her.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I must have begun my vigil in the forenoon, for it seemed fully two
weeks before I saw the four welcome figures turning in at the gate,
and snow balling each other as they came down the lane.</Sentence> <Sentence>Little they
knew of what awaited them!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I got a hearing with my brother George first, and he cautioned me
about speaking to anyone else, for he said he knew exactly what to do.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He could show me that Hattie was wrong.</Sentence> <Sentence>And he did.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The night before Christmas he took me out, and showed me the hay and
oats he had placed in an old water-trough for Santa Claus‚Äô reindeers,
charging me to look well at it, and to observe that the roof leading
to the chimney had no tracks.</Sentence> <Sentence>I observed these things.</Sentence> <Sentence>On Christmas
morning, I was taken out again for observation, and found the hay and
oats gone, and tracks plainly visible on the snowy roof.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were
other proofs too, that thrilled me to my heart‚Äôs core.</Sentence> <Sentence>In my stocking,
hung beside the fire, were, carefully wrapped in red tissue paper, a
dappled gray tin horse, and a blue glass mug, with ‚ÄúLove the Giver,‚Äù
on it in white letters.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wondered what Hattie would say to this!</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was a glorious Christmas.</Sentence> <Sentence>The whole house was full of surprises.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There were paper balls hung at the windows, and spruce boughs
glittering with diamonds over the doors, and a new scarf for me, dark
brown, ‚Äúto match your eyes,‚Äù Elizabeth said.</Sentence> <Sentence>It looked very much like
the pale blue one Hannah used to have, and the color made me think of
the butternut dye that mother used for carpet rags, but I am glad to
record I was too much of a lady to say so.</Sentence> <Sentence>The tin horse, all so
nicely dappled, with a red saddle painted on his back, was the high
spot of that Christmas and though he divided in two before the day was
over, I set one before the other, and had a team.</Sentence> <Sentence>The smell of the
paint on the horse was delicious to me, and still is the real aroma of
Christmas‚Äîthat tin toy smell.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember that Christmas, because it was the last year that I was a
true believer.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>We lived a mile from Chatsworth, on the Garafraxa road, in a stony
part of the county of Grey.</Sentence> <Sentence>The stones lay over our farm like flocks
of sheep.</Sentence> <Sentence>But one can grow accustomed to stones.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were merely a
part of the landscape to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our barn was a fine big one painted red,
with great doors in the loft that swung outward to receive the
winter‚Äôs hay.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hay-loft could be reached from the inside by a
ladder on the wall.</Sentence> <Sentence>Once we found a tramp had slept in the hay-loft
and ‚Äúit was a mercy he had not set fire to it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Instead he called at
the door the next morning and thanked us for letting him stay, and was
asked in for breakfast.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The house was of dressed timbers, cut from our own logs, and the
outside was white-washed, and looked very well under the hard maples.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a spring of cold water coming out of a bank behind the
house, and over this little stream the milk house was built, a small
white-washed building with a flagged floor, the centre of which was a
tiny pond edged with stones, where the milk-pans stood cool and sweet.</Sentence>
<Sentence>That perpetual stream of crystal water that ran in and ran out, losing
itself in a green meadow below the house was a fragrant memory to all
of us and even after we moved to <Location>Manitoba</Location> and were comfortably
established there, my mother still mourned for that living well of
water that bubbled out of the hill and failed not in winter or in
summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a ‚Äúdrink from the spring,‚Äù that she craved more than
anything else, when the tides of life ran low.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Being the youngest of the six children, I received much of my early
education from my brothers and sisters.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will, my eldest brother, who
was fifteen when I was born, was my devoted friend and champion,
always.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a tall boy for his age; had curly brown hair, fine
brown eyes, creamy skin and red cheeks, and I think he was my mother‚Äôs
favorite child.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the winter of the deep snow, seven years before I
was born, my father had bronchitis and it was Willie who helped mother
to care for the cattle and horses.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was only eight years old, hardly
able to swing an axe, but he chopped wood until his nose bled.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
snow was so deep that for three weeks no sleigh could get through, and
she was there alone, with a sick man, and three small children, one a
baby a month old, and ten head of stock to feed and water.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother
was not given to tears, but her eyes were always wet, when she talked
of that hard time, and how Will‚Äôs brave young spirit had never
faltered.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My second brother, George, two years younger than Will, was a natural
trader and a successful one.</Sentence> <Sentence>George always had interesting things in
his pockets‚Äîalleys, and knives and pretty stones, and once a knife
that in addition to two blades, had a pair of scissors which shut up
like a blade.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember hearing George closely questioned on the
subject of ‚Äústeel knuckles,‚Äù which, in some mysterious manner were
being put in circulation in our neighborhood, and every possible
avenue of distribution was being canvassed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But George was not guilty
of any connection with this form of armaments though he did say that
he thought ‚Äústeel knuckles,‚Äù plenty of ‚Äústeel knuckles,‚Äù enough for
everyone, would prevent all fights, for everyone would be afraid to
start an argument.</Sentence> <Sentence>George‚Äôs best line was jewelry, the costume jewelry
of the late seventies, and in return for a used horse-collar,
honorably earned by pulling weeds in a turnip patch, he received a
gorgeous stock of rings and tie-pins from a band of gypsies camped on
the commons.</Sentence> <Sentence>The rings and pins were kept under a stone in the potato
patch, and George might have carried on his business free from
discovery but that his kind heart betrayed him, as it has many another
good man.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I burned my arm one evening by falling on the stove from my high
chair, and to stay my screams George brought me from his treasure
chest, a solitaire ruby ring, the ruby being, as I remember it, quite
large enough for the parking light on a car.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the uproar had been
calmed and my arm was resting in a cold starch pack, Mother had time
to go into the matter of the ring, now tightly clutched in my good
hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>George told the truth‚Äîhe was never known to depart from it‚Äîand
that enterprise came to an end.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the ring, which I with an
invalid‚Äôs privilege was allowed to keep, helped more than the starch
to heal my arm.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My eldest sister, Elizabeth, deserves a whole book.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was
everybody‚Äôs friend.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could comb hair and make curls without
hurting.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could find things that had been lost for days.</Sentence> <Sentence>She knew
where everything was.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could think of games to play and even make
up games.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could take thorns from fingers, and understand how
dresses got dirty.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her hair was bright brown and her skin clear and
white; so clear and soft, that one of the neighbor girls, (Hattie‚Äôs
sister) circulated the report that Lizzie Mooney washed her face every
night in buttermilk, which my mother indignantly denied.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
Elizabeth, with that fine philosophy which has helped her over many
rough places in life, said nothing, but began to do this very thing to
see if it had any virtue, and today, though she has faced hot winds in
summer and cold winds in winter, she has never lost her apple-blossom
complexion.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah, who had the reputation of being the best child Tish ever saw,
was a round-faced little girl with large, dark blue eyes and auburn
hair, like mother‚Äôs mother, Margaret Fullerton McCurdy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah spoke
only when she had something to say and was always listened to with
respect.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could read when she was seven, and read stories to me‚Äîon
conditions.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not go to school until I was ten, so Hannah had
several good productive years when she measured out to me a dole of
fiction in return for sundry little chores.</Sentence> <Sentence>When she was reading, and
I was sweeping the floor, and listening in a trance of delight to
‚ÄúDavy and the Goblin,‚Äù or ‚ÄúChildren of the New Forest,‚Äù sometimes in
my rapture I would forget to sweep and leaning on the broom-handle
gaze open-mouthed through the golden door she had opened for me
.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>until the silence of the room made me remember my bargain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah had rather a hard deal in the matter of her name.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had
intended to call her ‚ÄúMargaret Alice,‚Äù but a friend of hers came back
to Chatsworth to visit, and everyone was doing things for the visitor
and mother named the baby for her, ‚ÄúHannah Maria Conger.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I thought it
a very beautiful name, but the owner of it has not thought so,
although she carries it gracefully and without complaint.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My youngest brother, Jack, five years my senior was a sturdy, square
little chap, given to fighting, and walking the ridgepole of the barn.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He was only five years older than I, but I never seemed to catch up to
him.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a selection in the readers of that day beginning:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe rocky John Thomas,
    The hedger and ditcher,
  Although he was poor
    Never cared to be richer,‚Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>which never failed to draw fire from my youngest brother, who hated it
violently.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps he was repelled by the lowly occupation of his
namesake, or his lack of ambition, but anyway it registered.</Sentence> <Sentence>I used it
myself against him, but only when I was at a safe distance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack had a
great distaste for anything sentimental and always went out, when a
story was being read to us, which had anything in it of love or
courtship.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said he ‚Äúwould never get married: he would live with a
man and keep dogs.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER II‚ÄîThe Family</Sentence>


<Sentence>My father, John Mooney, came to <Location>Bytown</Location> in Upper <Location>Canada</Location> from <Location>Ireland</Location> in
the year 1830, crossing the ocean in a sailing vessel which took ten
weeks to make the voyage.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was then a lad of eighteen, who had never
done anything but go to school, but the famines in <Location>Ireland</Location> were
driving the young men to seek their fortunes elsewhere; and already
some of his kinsmen had made the venture of coming to the New World.</Sentence>
<Sentence>His two older brothers, William and Thomas came with him, and a
cousin, Robert Clarke.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My grandfather, William Mooney of Nenagh, <Location>Tipperary</Location>, near the rock of
Cashel was a steward for a nobleman, and lived in a fine stone house,
‚Äúrent free, with kail yard and byre,‚Äù and had what was considered a
good position, but the family was large and growing, so he was quite
willing to let the three eldest boys go, and outfitted them generously
with hand-woven blankets and frieze coats.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My father‚Äôs mother, Elizabeth Scott, had died when he was eight years
old, and my grandfather had married again, and the second family,
numbering five, would be enough for him to look after.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maria, my
father‚Äôs sister came out the next year, and on her arrival in <Location>Bytown</Location>,
married Robert Clarke, the cousin, who had come out with my father.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My Uncle Tom, who was a school-teacher, soon found a position in a
settlement school near <Location>Bytown</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>William who could make a fiddle ‚Äúdo
everything but talk,‚Äù was a welcome guest at George Clark‚Äôs tavern, on
the Main street of the four-year-old village.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father went with the
shanty men, who were bringing down rafts of logs on the ‚ÄúGrand River,‚Äù
as the <Location>Ottawa</Location> was called then.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a rough life for a boy of
eighteen, but wages were good and there was plenty of companionship,
and adventure.</Sentence> <Sentence><Location>Bytown</Location>, named for Colonel By, came into being by the
building of the <Location>Rideau Canal</Location>, begun in 1826 by the Imperial
Government, and a great project it was, to open a waterway between
<Location>Bytown</Location> and <Location>Kingston</Location>, a distance of one hundred and twenty-six miles,
at a cost of one million pounds.</Sentence> <Sentence>The money came from the Old Country
in half-crowns, packed in kegs which helped to put silver in
circulation in <Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He remembered seeing Colonel By many times riding on his black horse,
as he watched the progress of his men, and when many years later the
name of <Location>Bytown</Location> was changed to <Location>Ottawa</Location>, my father thought it a great
pity to lose the name of this fine soldier whom every one admired.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The shanty men, mostly French and Irish were a wild crew, he said,
with whiskey running free in every shebeen, and many a time the
streets of <Location>Bytown</Location> were filled with drunken, cursing fighters.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
remembered seeing an Irish Roman Catholic priest, with a horsewhip
flogging the members of his flock into a better frame of mind, and
demanding that they appear at the confessional the next day.</Sentence> <Sentence>And they
did.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After several years of logging, and many narrow escapes from drowning,
he began to think of farming as a better and pleasanter way of living.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He had earned good wages on the river but he had saved very little.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
knew of the new gravel road that was being built from the Georgian Bay
to <Location>Toronto</Location>, in the western part of the Province, and that free grants
of land could be taken on each side of the road.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had heard about it
first from a Methodist missionary, who worked among the Ojibways,
still farther west, and who had come to <Location>Bytown</Location> to visit his relatives
there.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Shouldice family, cousins of the Mooneys, living in Neapean, had
made the move, making the trip safely across Georgian Bay in a bateau,
by keeping close to the shore.</Sentence> <Sentence>While this matter was being turned over
in his mind, <Location>Bytown</Location> suffered an outbreak of typhoid fever, and his
brother Tom took it and died.</Sentence> <Sentence>Later in the same year William also
died, and my father, alone now, except for his sister, Mrs. Robert
Clarke, who lived in Neapean decided to make the move.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He made the trip across the Georgian Bay in 1841, took up the free
grant of fifty acres, and by helping to chop out the road earned
another fifty acres, and then settled down to the tremendous task of
clearing his land, which was all heavily timbered with hard maple,
hemlock and elm.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each fifty-acre lot had a frontage of forty rods and
a depth of two hundred rods.</Sentence> <Sentence>The first ten years seem to have been a
sort of endurance test, and I remember of hearing the sad but heroic
tale of one settler called <Location>Barnes</Location>, thirteen miles down the road who
actually died of starvation and no one knew of it until he was dead.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He had tried to live on cow-cabbage, refusing to take any of the
potatoes or cow‚Äôs milk from the children.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In 1850, the township of <Location>Sullivan</Location>, on the west side of the gravel
road, was organized in proper form, with a reeve and a council.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
records show that John Mooney was the first treasurer, and received
for his labors the sum of one pound, ten shillings.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were one
hundred and thirty-three ratepayers and the amount collected was one
hundred and twenty-three dollars and eighty-one cents, and after all
expenses were paid there was a balance on hand of eight dollars and
twenty-six cents to start the new year.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the balance was on the
right side of the ledger.</Sentence> <Sentence>They built a school that year, and there was
a stipulation that any religious denomination might use the building.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Each child who attended the school must pay at the rate of one
shilling and sixpence per month, and each third child was to be taught
free of charge.</Sentence> <Sentence>The teacher boarded around.</Sentence> <Sentence>William Buchanan who was
the first teacher received a salary of twelve pounds per annum.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The gravel road was called the Garafraxa, which is surely as fitting a
name as any gravel road ever received, and was completed to <Location>Toronto</Location> in
1842.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My Uncle Tom, the school-teacher, has always been a shadowy figure to
me, leaving no trace of his personality in my memory, though I do
remember a box of old Irish school-books in calfskin bindings, yellow
vellum and long s‚Äôs with his name written in them in violet ink.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
William, the boy who could ‚Äúturn the heart in ye,‚Äù when he played the
‚ÄúIrish Lament‚Äù‚ÄîWilliam with his brown eyes and auburn hair, slim and
straight as a gun-barrel; with a laugh that you would hear in a room
full of people, for the lilt of it; William who was talked of in all
the lumber camps and on the rafts, as the men were coming down the
rivers; who died in his twenty-fifth year in a noisy room above the
bar in a <Location>Bytown</Location> tavern, where he had so often played for dances, was
one of my infant heroes, and I was disposed to boast about him, when I
played with other children, though he was dead forty years before I
was born.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I heard music that swept my young heart with longing, I
knew it was something like the performance of my Uncle William.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
father had been up the river when William died, and he never ceased to
regret his absence.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After taking up his land on the Garafraxa, my father married Jane
Shouldice, his cousin, but Jane lived only a little over a year.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the news went back to Nenagh, <Location>Ireland</Location>, that Johnny‚Äôs wife had
died, and that Johnny was the only one left of the three fine lads who
had sailed from <Location>Limerick</Location>, and that he was alone on a bush farm, old
Judy Connor, one of the servants in my grandfather‚Äôs house in
Nenagh‚Äîand she was then fifty years of age‚Äîbraved the terrors of the
<Location>Atlantic</Location>, and came all the way to Sydenham to keep house for him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In 1858 he married my mother, Letitia McCurdy, who had come with her
mother, Margaret Fullerton McCurdy, and a younger sister Ellen from
<Location>Dundee</Location>, <Location>Scotland</Location>, the year before.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Judy Connor lived with them all her days, and it has always been a
regret to me that I was not born early enough to have met Judy, in the
flesh, with her belief in fairies, and banshees.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Judy at certain times and seasons, that had to do with the moon, took
the precautionary measure of leaving a pan of milk on the grass for
the fairies to wash in.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seems it was always done in <Location>Ireland</Location> to keep
the little people in good-humor.</Sentence> <Sentence>But one night my mother, who did not
believe in fairies, gave the milk to the pigs, and used the pan for
something else, and the next day she slipped on a stone in the
milkhouse, and turned her ankle, and Judy told her it was ‚Äúwell for
her, it wasn‚Äôt worse,‚Äù so the pan was left thereafter.</Sentence> <Sentence>When Judy lay
dying, she had everyone listening for the banshee, who should, by all
the laws of compensation and tradition, have cried below the window,
but no sound troubled the stillness of the maple trees around the
house, until Watch, the dog, sensing that something was happening,
lifted his head to the stars, and howled drearily.</Sentence> <Sentence>Judy heard him
through the shadows that were closing around her, and opening her
eyes, she looked at my mother in triumph.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNow, thank God, I can die,‚Äù
she said, and she did!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother‚Äôs father, Duncan McCurdy, who was of the McCurdy‚Äôs from the
Isle of Bute, had died of cholera in the outbreak of 1856, in <Location>Dundee</Location>
and it was then, with their breadwinner gone, and under necessity to
make their own living, that the women of the family came to <Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>An
older sister, Elizabeth, was married to a man named John Taylor in
<Location>Dundee</Location>, and stayed behind, afterwards emigrating to <Location>Australia</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My grandmother‚Äôs two sisters had emigrated two years before with their
families, and settled in the township of <Location>Holland</Location>, east of the
Garafraxa where the land was more fertile than in <Location>Sullivan</Location>, where my
father settled.</Sentence> <Sentence>As a result of this, the <Location>Holland</Location> relatives, as the
years went by, prospered more than we did and grew comparatively rich.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The two aunts were rather patronizing to my grandmother, whom I
remember as a slight little woman, in a gray dress, with reddish hair,
who was always ready to tell a story to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her two sisters, older
than she, did not even talk like anyone else, accounted for by the
fact, that in <Location>Scotland</Location> they had lived in ‚ÄúEnbro,‚Äù and so rather
despised the more commercial city of <Location>Dundee</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>As a final proof of their
magnificence, in each of their homes in <Location>Holland</Location>, there was an organ,
but they did not call it that.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the ‚Äúinstrument,‚Äù and could not
be played on Sunday.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was taken to one of their homes once and there
was no music from the ‚Äúinstrument;‚Äù it stood in the corner, a
complicated bulk of carved wood, and red velvet, locked tight and
ornamented with two high and fluted gray vases of dead grass.</Sentence> <Sentence>The red
velvet, showing so enticingly through the wood-carving called to me to
poke one small finger through and see for myself if it could be pushed
back, but some good angel stayed my hand.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER III‚ÄîThe House and the People</Sentence>


<Sentence>My memory of our old house is somewhat shadowy, but I know that smoked
hams hung from the rafters in the kitchen, and from one corner were
suspended brown festoons of dried apples, done by a paring-machine
which went around the neighborhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>The walls of all the rooms were
white-washed, and only the big log beams that held up the ceiling were
left in their natural state.</Sentence> <Sentence>The floors were pine boards and were
scrubbed every week, using very little soap, for soap yellowed the
wood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Elbow grease was the thing!</Sentence> <Sentence>The heating was done by a huge
cookstove, with a high oven, in the kitchen and a round heater in the
front room which had a drum upstairs to collect and radiate heat to
the bedrooms.</Sentence> <Sentence>Seats near either stove were much prized for the outer
area was very cold when the north wind swept down from the Georgian
Bay.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The floor had lengths of rag carpet in pale stripes and there were red
and brown mats, hooked in circles and triangles.</Sentence> <Sentence>The inside doors were
home-made ones and had buttons of wood instead of latches.</Sentence> <Sentence>The two
front windows had hand-knitted curtains, done by mother, in a fern
pattern and paper lace valentines were hung on them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Two pictures, I remember very well, ‚ÄúWinter,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutumn.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Two
beautiful women‚Äî‚ÄúAutumn,‚Äù wreathed with red leaves and purple fruit,
and ‚ÄúWinter,‚Äù dressed in white fur with holly berries on her cap.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúWinter,‚Äù with her soft eyes was my ideal of beauty and I determined
to be just like her when I grew up, if it could be arranged.</Sentence> <Sentence>These
prints were given as premiums with the _<Location>Montreal</Location> Family Herald_ and
_Weekly Star_, and there were really four in the series, for I had
seen ‚ÄúSpring,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSummer,‚Äù at my aunt Ellen‚Äôs house.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a
steel engraving of the Battle of Waterloo, which I did not like.</Sentence> <Sentence>In
it, <Location>Wellington</Location> and <Location>Blucher</Location> on their horses, were shaking hands across
the bodies of the slain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dead men and horses carpeted the field, and
one young fellow was trying to raise his head, and his face was full
of pain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack said, I was crazy to cry about it, for the dead men and
this wounded one were all Frenchmen and our enemies and it served them
right; but even so, he could not explain away the dead horses.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was another horrible black and white print, ‚ÄúThe Stag at Bay,‚Äù
of a poor tired stag with his back to a rock, facing a pack of fierce
and snarling hounds.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was trapped, and beaten with no hope of
escape, but he was still fighting.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was one pretty chromo called ‚ÄúThe Old Mill Stream,‚Äù which showed
a rapid stream, the mill-race, bright blue in color, from which a
beautiful dog, a big tawny fellow, had just saved a little girl, with
golden curls and pantalettes, from drowning.</Sentence> <Sentence>She lay on the grass very
wet and pale, but her mother was running across the green with
outstretched arms.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was another colored picture of a girl in a long white nightie,
and golden hair holding herself out of the water by hanging tightly to
a wooden cross set in a rock.</Sentence> <Sentence>White gulls flew overhead, and I knew
she was cold and wet.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was taken to Sunday-school in Chatsworth, by Elizabeth and Annie
Stevenson, who made a chair and carried me when I got tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>Annie was
a lovely girl, who wore a hat with plumes and seemed to belong to us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Sunday-school was held in the church, with green baize curtains to
divide the classes.</Sentence> <Sentence>But there was no room for the ‚ÄúBusy Bees,‚Äù one
Sunday so we were taken across the road to the parsonage parlor, and
the minister‚Äôs wife told us about ‚ÄúMoses,‚Äù who had a little bed of
switches smeared with tar, to keep out the water, and was put in the
river for safe keeping; and then she took our collection, one copper
each, tied in a knot in our handkerchiefs.</Sentence> <Sentence>It took quite a while to
extract the coins, because we had chewed the knots.</Sentence> <Sentence>Six cents was the
day‚Äôs receipts.</Sentence> <Sentence>We stood around her when she played her little organ,
which had white teeth all right, but no high top like the
‚Äúinstruments‚Äù in <Location>Holland</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she asked us all to come back, and told
us the school had grown, so we would come there every Sunday now, and
we were glad.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I went home, and released the big story about
‚ÄúMoses,‚Äù being put in the river, I was disappointed to find they all
knew it!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I received a small card each Sunday with a verse set in a little frame
of flowers, and there was a hope held out that four small cards would
be rewarded with a big one, but I never was able to put it to the test
for I could not keep the little cards.</Sentence> <Sentence>They got lost.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My first time to be in church was at a revival meeting held at the
Sauble, where Rev.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Read, the Methodist minister of Chatsworth, was
holding special services and when father and mother went one night,
they had to take me for it seemed there was no way of leaving me.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
mother, being a Scotch Presbyterian, did not hold with revival
services and testimony meetings and confessions, but father was an
out-and-out Methodist, and had experienced the strange ‚Äúwarming of the
heart,‚Äù that John Wesley wrote about in his Journal.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were late for the meeting and the altar call was sounding when we
entered, and crowds of people were pressing forward; and as many more
came in when we did, we found ourselves among the seekers, and we
knelt there with the others.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Read put his hand on my head and said
no child was too young to be reconciled to God, and he was glad to
receive the lambs of the flock.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was the only child at the altar and
I liked him very much for being so friendly.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was a tall man with brown whiskers and a cheerful face.</Sentence> <Sentence>He moved
his ears when he talked which I thought very clever of him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a
trick too, just learned that day from my brother Will.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could shut
one eye and keep the other one wide open, and I thought he might like
to see me do it.</Sentence> <Sentence>So when an old man who stuttered, was giving his
testimony and holding back the meeting with everyone getting
impatient, I kept my one eye on the minister and the other one shut.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother said after we went home, that Mr. Read was too light a man to
be preaching the gospel, for when poor old Samuel Norton was speaking
he actually began to laugh, though he had tried to turn it into a
cough.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father was loyal to the minister and said there was no harm
in a laugh at any time, and it would be better if there were more
laughter in the churches.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But mother refused to accept this, and said, there was a time to laugh
and it was not in the church.</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt like to hear Mr. Read
criticized, so I said I wanted to go again for I wanted to make my
peace with God, and that stopped the argument.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was ready to
talk to me then, and tried to explain what it meant to be a Christian.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She said, I would have to stop mocking people; for that was my
besetting sin; though it was not so much my fault, she said, as it was
the fault of older people who encouraged me and laughed at me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew
who the older people were and I was sorry that I had drawn my father
into another argument.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The only people I had ever mocked were mother‚Äôs two aunts, who lived
in <Location>Holland</Location>‚Äîtwo thin old ladies who owned the ‚Äúinstruments,‚Äù who
dressed in black silk made with tight bodies and full skirts, and wore
mutches, and knit with flashing steel needles.</Sentence> <Sentence>They came to visit us
once a year anyway and when that happened, father took to the barn.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
always had peas to flail when the aunts came.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I loved to listen to them and get their stories, just as they told
them, which was not always easy, for the aunts to save time talked
both at once.</Sentence> <Sentence>On account of the bad roads in <Location>Holland</Location>, they did not get
out much, and when they did they talked without a pause.</Sentence> <Sentence>I sat near
them, drinking in every word and they often said I was a nice quiet
child.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I had gathered a good earful I made my way to the barn to
tell my father, and with two bright straws for knitting-needles, I
relayed what I could remember, and so well received was my recital, I
often stayed out until I was nearly frozen.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not only their
words, but their peculiar accent that gave my recital merit.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had
a queer droning way of speaking.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But now, having renounced the world, I knew I would have to give this
up.</Sentence> <Sentence>I must not mock my mother‚Äôs aunts!</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped they would not come
soon, not until I was stronger in the faith, for the pleasure of
seeing my father lean on his flail and laugh until his eyes ran with
tears, was hard to forego, and I knew so many of their stories now, it
seemed too bad to waste them.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were times when I looked back,
like the children of <Location>Israel</Location>, and longed for my degenerate days.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The catechism helped to keep my spirits aflame.</Sentence> <Sentence>In it I seemed to have
had special mention.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat is your name?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù was one question, early in
the book.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúM or N,‚Äù was the answer, so I hoped from that, that I was
numbered with the blest and for the time, at least, continued in the
way.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>It was a mellow evening in early autumn, for the apples were ripe on
the trees behind the milkhouse, their bright red globes gleaming in
the gray-green leaves, and there was a smell of ripening grain in the
air, and a blue haze dulled the horizon, and blotted out the hills.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was being taken down to the lower meadow by Lizzie, the good angel
of my childhood, for this was the evening when the pigs were being
killed, and my heart was ready to break.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not that I had a pet pig or
cared about the pigs as individuals.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was a little afraid of pigs,
and thought they were greedy, ill-mannered brutes, but even so, I felt
they had a right to live, or at least to die without pain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>All day I knew what was coming!</Sentence> <Sentence>The pigs were being starved for the
killing, and they squealed in their pens and quarrelled among
themselves.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hole was dug for the barrel, which would be filled
with boiling water from the boiler set on stones with wood laid under.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The gruesome scaffold had been erected, and the whole farmyard had
been changed from a friendly playground, to a place of evil.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We walked over the hill behind the house just as the sun was dipping
into the mist of evening, and a queer green light came into the upper
and eastern sky.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie‚Äôs hand was very comforting in mine now that my
world had gone wrong, and the sorrows of life were overflowing.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
told me she had a new pattern for a dress for me, with a little
scalloped collar, which would be edged with turkey-red, and the
tie-backs would have scalloped ends, and the dress would have red
pearl buttons, with one on each pocket.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We sat beside the little stream just before it lost itself in the
meadow, and she found stovepipe grass for me to piece together into a
chain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She thought that by taking me over the hill the sounds would not come
through, but just as I had almost forgotten why we had come, in my
delight and surprise at the honey sandwiches which she had produced
from under her coat‚Äîthe terrible cry came drilling through the hill,
and tore through us like a thousand poisoned arrows.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew then, that
life was a place of horror, in spite of flowers and trees, and
streams, and I flung myself down on the grass and cried my heart out
in an agony of helplessness.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember how she put her two kind hands
over my ears, but that piercing cry came in at every pore of my body.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lizzie told me God made pigs for meat for people.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were of no
other use and if they were all let live there would be pigs
everywhere, and how would I like that?</Sentence> <Sentence>But I asked her why they had to
suffer like this; why didn‚Äôt God make them like trees or grain?</Sentence>_<Sentence>They_
didn‚Äôt squeal when they were cut down.</Sentence> <Sentence>God could have done that, if He
wanted to.</Sentence> <Sentence>He made everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie admitted she did not know why
there had to be such pain in the world; she said she often wondered,
but it wasn‚Äôt right to criticize God, His ways were always right.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
I was rebellious.</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt think much of the world, and I was through
with being a Christian.</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt love God, and I was going to be like
uncle Abner and not care for anything, but just having a good time.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I‚Äôd go to the dances when I grew up, and put hair-oil on my hair and
stay out late.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I would mock the aunts, I would mock them worse
than ever, and I didn‚Äôt care how soon they came, and I was through
with Sunday-school and would burn my tickets.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lizzie did not try to stem my outburst.</Sentence> <Sentence>She let me rave on and in the
raving I found relief.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew my words were wild and wicked, but in
some way they restored me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wild words were safe with Lizzie; she would
never remember them against anybody; they fell around her like dust
that is blown away.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every family needs one member who has the gift of
listening, and forgetting.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was quite dark when we got home, and Lizzie led me around to the
front door and we went upstairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>The house was heavy with the smell of
rendering lard, which reminded me there would be doughnuts tomorrow
and I resolved I wouldn‚Äôt eat one‚Äîor at least very few of them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother
came up to see me after I had gone to bed and told me the pigs‚Äô
suffering was all over in a minute, and I must put it all out of my
mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>Father knew exactly how to kill a pig with the least possible
amount of suffering, and he just hated to do it too; when he was a
little boy in <Location>Ireland</Location> he always ran away to the bog when the pigs were
killed, but now he knew it had to be done and he always did it
himself, just to be sure it was done quickly.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was glad to know that
he hated to do it, for I adored my father and couldn‚Äôt bear to think
him cruel.</Sentence> <Sentence>I ate the remainder of the honey sandwiches and went to
sleep.</Sentence>

<Sentence>People who write about their own family usually tell much of family
tyranny and misunderstanding, and in the minds of many, parents and
children are natural enemies, but I have not much to say about
parental oppression.</Sentence> <Sentence>My people were hard-working folk, greatly
concerned with the problems of making a living, tired many a time with
the day‚Äôs work and perplexed with life‚Äôs cares, but they were never
too tired or busy to comfort a sad little heart, or do their best to
direct a lost young pilgrim back to the highway of happiness.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER IV‚ÄîEchoes from the West</Sentence>


<Sentence>I have a wistful memory of the sunlit populous farmyard, over which
fresh yellow straw drifted as the wind blew, and where I could rove at
will, without a care or a fear.</Sentence> <Sentence>The white house under the red maples,
with bright sumach trees in front, threw back the sunshine in a dazzle
that made me wink my eyes, but I loved to look at it.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was
something about it that satisfied me.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was so sure and safe.</Sentence>

<Sentence>As I drifted around the farmyard, I liked to sing, swaying and dancing
to my own music.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had heard Jenny Lind, the Swedish nightingale,
before she came to <Location>Canada</Location>, and although my mother was not a singer,
she made us understand the moving power of a great voice.</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúCome, arouse you, arouse you,
    My brave shepherd boy
  To the fields, now and labor away,
    The dew is sparkling in the beam,
  The kine are thronging to the stream!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was all I knew but as I sang it, I could hear that golden voice
rising and falling in a rushing, sweeping melody that sang in my
veins, and wrung my heart with emotion.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never sang this when anyone
could hear me for always it made me cry.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I have heard some of the world‚Äôs great singers since then, and felt
the magic of good music, but never have I been more transfigured or
intoxicated with sweet sounds than when, in my fancy, I heard the
voice of Jenny Lind, coming to me out of the long past, and from far
across the sea,</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe dew is sparkling in the beam,
  The kine are thronging to the stream!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>An <Location>Ontario</Location> farm, in the early eighties, was a busy place, and every
one on our farm, moved briskly.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father often said of my mother that
she could keep forty people busy.</Sentence> <Sentence>She certainly could think of things
for people to do.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe that was one reason for my enjoying the
farmyard so much.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loved to sit on the top rail of the fence, and
luxuriantly do nothing, when I was well out of the range of her
vision.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother herself worked harder than anyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was the first up
in the morning and the last one to go to bed at night.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our teams were
on the land, and the Monday morning washing on the line well ahead of
the neighbors‚Äô.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know now these things compensated her for the busy
life she led, for everyone has to be proud of something.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I often wished we could all slow down a bit.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to hear more
talk.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to do some of it myself too.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seemed too bad to be
always rushing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Early to bed and early to rise!</Sentence> <Sentence>To-morrow always
crashing in on the heels of today!</Sentence> <Sentence>I heard Will say he was tired of
working on a treadmill.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew he felt like the horses on the
threshing-machine; drawing, and walking round and around in endless
circles, always going but never arriving.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie, too, who changed her
dress the very minute she came in from school and never stopped until
bedtime, had often told me to play all I could, and sleep all I could,
for when I was big enough to work there would be plenty of it to do.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even the twenty-fourth of May which is second only to Christmas, had
to have its dole of work done in the morning, or there could be no
picnic in the afternoon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember rising in the gray dawn with the
others, and helping in a feverish potato-planting drive, so we could
all go to a picnic at the Sauble at two o‚Äôclock.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One morning, Hannah and Jack had to have pens, and were sent out to
look for enough eggs to make the purchase.</Sentence> <Sentence>Three dozen were found, and
after a casting up of figures‚Äîcopybook ten cents, pens five cents,
with eggs ten cents‚Äîit seemed a fair hope that the purchase could be
made.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course, there was always the danger that eggs might go down,
in which case Hannah would have to wait the pleasure of the hens for
her copybook.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack was elected to carry the egg-basket for he was ten, and Hannah
was only eight.</Sentence> <Sentence>But at this juncture dissension arose.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack would not
carry an egg-basket.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would do anything but that.</Sentence> <Sentence>Carrying eggs and
peddling eggs was not a man‚Äôs job, Hannah would have to do it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He did
not care if he never got a copybook.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother could hardly find words to express her indignation.</Sentence> <Sentence>He should
be glad we had eggs to sell.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone sold eggs!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack set his jaw, and repeated his contention.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah, who never
wasted words, took the basket and departed.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was half-way to the
road before her absence was noted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This was in the early morning of a rainy day, and both Will and George
were in the house, and had heard the discussion.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThat lad will never
make an <Location>Ontario</Location> farmer,‚Äù George said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will was eating his breakfast, and suddenly shoved back his plate.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI
know how he feels, though I must say it has hit him early.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am tired
of the butter-and-egg business too!</Sentence> <Sentence>It does seem that hard work, early
and late, should bring in a little money‚Äîreal money that would be a
pleasure to spend.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now we have to sneak in with a basket of eggs, or a
crock of butter, when we want a pair of boots or a new tie.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>The
soil is too gravelly and light to grow a decent crop‚Äîand the more
stones we pick off, the more come up from below.</Sentence> <Sentence>By raking and
harrowing, and coaxing them along, the fields will raise cattle-feed
and chicken-feed, but no big crops that can be sold for cash.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
County of Grey is on a narrow gauge and always will be.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was standing beside the stove listening to them.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat can we do, boys?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù she said anxiously.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôre here and we‚Äôve got
to live.</Sentence> <Sentence>Your father cleared every bit of this farm, and we can‚Äôt just
pick up and leave it, and where would we go, anyway?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will got up, and began his preparations for going out; a rainy day had
its own activities, the seed wheat had to go through the fanning-mill.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cameron has a book about a trip a man made with a dog, from <Location>Fort
Garry</Location> away West, and it‚Äôs a wonderful country, he says; the man‚Äôs name
is Butler, and he came from <Location>Tipperary</Location>, near Nenagh too.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father suddenly became interested.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLook at that now!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he said.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut can you believe what you read?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù mother asked lapsing into her
<Location>Dundee</Location> accent.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúPen and paper refuse nothing.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cameron believes it,‚Äù Will said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI was in there the other night
with the boys, and he read us about a buffalo hunt that was great.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Thousands of buffaloes on a plain a hundred miles wide, and not a tree
or a stone.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will knew he had quieted every doubt, in mother‚Äôs mind, for Mr.
Cameron was the Presbyterian minister in Chatsworth and had recently
come from <Location>Scotland</Location>.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúAnd there are letters in the <Location>Toronto</Location> _Globe_,
written by a man called White, saying there‚Äôs room for millions of
people in the <Location>North-West</Location>.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and you know what George McDougall
said.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut the cold is terrible in the <Location>North-West</Location>,‚Äù mother said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI remember
the geography we had in our school at home said, that the haymakers
were often frozen in their tents, and the country should be left to
the Indians.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty room for the Indians, too,‚Äù said Will.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôve no idea
of the size of the <Location>North-West</Location>.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Mr. Cameron says the Rebellion of
1870 did one good thing, it brought eastern men out there, and let
them see the country with their own eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>They saw it, and saw its
good soil, and now there is a real movement to take up land.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd like
to be going, I certainly want better soil than we have here.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Thomas White‚Äôs letters in the <Location>Montreal</Location> _Gazette_ and <Location>Toronto</Location> _Globe_
were handed about and read, and discussed at Breeze‚Äôs store and in the
tavern.</Sentence> <Sentence>The majority of the farmers were skeptical.</Sentence> <Sentence>No country could
be as good as this!</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a scheme of the land agents to get honest
men‚Äôs money!</Sentence> <Sentence>Men who had the best farms in the community spoke this
way, but men, particularly young men, who worked on stony farms
listened eagerly.</Sentence> <Sentence>Chilblains and stone bruises made their minds
receptive.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In the winter of 1878, our neighborhood had a visitor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Young Michael
Lowery, who had been gone two years, came home.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had gone to
<Location>Manitoulin Island</Location> first, and then drifted west to the <Location>Red River</Location>
country, where he had fallen in with freighters, earned good money
with them, and with it had outfitted for farming, and settled on a
piece of land in <Location>southwestern Manitoba</Location>, where the railway was already
surveyed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Young Michael had really come back to be married, but for family
reasons that purpose was carefully concealed.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was still some
doubt that he would be able to get his girl away from her aunt, who
was a masterful woman, and knowing her niece‚Äôs ability as a
housekeeper, did not propose to lose her without a struggle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was a handsome young giant and wore a shaganappi coat, heavily
beaded and fringed on the seams with doe skin, and a red scarf and
toque; and he had with him a box of moccasins and gloves made by the
Indians.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had many tales to tell of good hunting, big game, narrow
escapes, friendly Indians, and above all in fascination for the
dwellers along the Garafraxa, hundreds of acres of land, without a
stone, or a bush, waiting to be taken.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were strawberries so
plentiful and luscious, that his oxen‚Äôs feet were red with them as he
ploughed the willing sod, young Michael said; and there were wild
plums and cranberries, spilling on the ground, with no one to pick
them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Young Michael must have told his story well, for the quiet waters of
our neighborhood were stirred to their depths, and discussions raged
in every farmhouse.</Sentence> <Sentence>As a rule the older people scoffed at the idea
that any place could be as free from ‚Äúdrawbacks,‚Äù as Michael claimed
for the <Location>North-West</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Hemstock family shook its composite head and
said, ‚ÄúGreen fields are far away.</Sentence> <Sentence>What about orchards in the
<Location>North-West</Location>?</Sentence> <Sentence>Can apple trees live in that frosty country?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù The
Hemstocks had a whole acre in fruit trees and a purple grapevine that
covered a stone fence.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Charltons on the next farm had had a
relative in <Location>Minnesota</Location> during the trouble with the Sioux and nothing
would move them from the security of <Location>Grey County</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But the young people kindled to the picture young Michael painted‚Äîthey
could see the sea of grass and the friendly skies above it, and they
could feel the intoxication of being the first to plant the seed in
that mellow black loam, enriched by a million years of rain and sun.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My bother Will caught the fever and when his chores were done, cleared
out every evening across the fields to Robert Lowery‚Äôs where young
Michael was staying, and did not come in till all hours, maybe ten
o‚Äôclock.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Echoes of Michael‚Äôs comparisons drifted in through Will‚Äôs
conversation.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúOut West they do things in a big way,‚Äù Will said.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúFifty acres is the size of a field not a farm.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there are no
coppers, Michael said; he hardly knew what they were when he saw
them.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHow do they get on without them?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù George asked incredulously.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThey don‚Äôt haggle about trifles,‚Äù said Will, ‚Äúa thing is either five
cents or ten cents.</Sentence> <Sentence>If it is less than five cents they give it to
you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat would save a lot of counting of collections,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúbut
it might keep some people from church too.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It always makes me
feel mean to see people put a cent on the collection plate; especially
them that can afford more.</Sentence> <Sentence>To see a woman with a nice braided dolman
put a penny on a plate is about as mean a sight as I know.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThis kind of pocket handkerchief-farming makes people mean‚ÄîMichael
says the people of <Location>Grey County</Location> would kill a flea for the hide and
tallow,‚Äù Will remarked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Strangely enough, my mother was more impressed than my father with Red
Michael‚Äôs story.</Sentence> <Sentence>She questioned him closely, and unlike some other
questioners, listened when he answered.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think Michael liked talking
to her.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll have to go some place, John,‚Äù she said one night to my father.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here for our three boys.</Sentence> <Sentence>What can we do with
one-hundred-and-fifty stony acres?</Sentence> <Sentence>The boys will be hired-men all
their lives, or clerks in a store.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs not good enough!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father was fearful!</Sentence> <Sentence>There were Indians to consider, not only Indians,
but mosquitoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had seen on the <Location>Ottawa</Location> what mosquitoes could do to
horses; and to people too.</Sentence> <Sentence>No!</Sentence> <Sentence>It was better to leave well enough
alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>Had any of us ever gone hungry?</Sentence> <Sentence>And now when we were getting
things fixed up pretty well, with the new root-house; and the
cook-house shingled, and the lower eighty broken up, and a good school
now, with a real teacher, and an inspector coming once a year anyway,
and a fine Sunday-school too, and all sorts of advantages.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>We all knew mother was agitated as she went around the house, for she
banged doors and set down stove-lids noisily.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she kept everyone
going at top speed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even I knew she was in some sort of tribulation of
spirit.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>When everything else was done, the leach had to be
watered; and that was one little chore I could do.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The leach was a small barrel of ashes, set up on a trestle, high
enough to cover a black iron pan.</Sentence> <Sentence>The barrel had small auger holes
bored in the bottom, and the innumerable pails of water poured on the
ashes would at last run through in reluctant black drops, and then the
leach was said to be running.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The lye thus extracted was used for making soap, and the day the soap
was made was a day of high adventure.</Sentence> <Sentence>The operation took place outside
in a big black kettle that was never used for anything else.</Sentence> <Sentence>No
ordinary day would do; it had to be a clear bright day with no wind,
and the moon had to be on the increase or the soap might not set.</Sentence> <Sentence>Over
a blazing fire, made in a hole lined with stones, the grease and lye
were fused in the old black pot and stirred all the time, from left to
right, with a hickory stick.</Sentence> <Sentence>All persons of six or under were excluded
from the ceremony, but there was nothing to prevent persons of six or
under from climbing out of an upstairs window, reaching the sloping
roof of the kitchen, lying flat on the edge and looking down.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a fascination in the fiery boiling of this billowy mass,
threatening every minute to boil over.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother, in a sprigged blue
print dress, tucked tightly between her knees and her head rolled in a
red handkerchief stood on the windward side, stirring with a quick
motion.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wooden boxes stood ready to receive the soap when it was done.</Sentence>
<Sentence>No one must speak to her or interrupt in any way when the boiling was
going on, for there was a moment when the pot must be removed and if
that moment were correctly guessed the soap would harden.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother
was the High Priestess of all domestic rites to me, so of course she
knew the exact moment.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had no doubt she invented soap-making, and I
was very proud of her cleverness, and sorry for the little girls whose
mothers couldn‚Äôt make soap and so had to use the ‚Äúboughten‚Äù kind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And there was a real trick in making soap.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even my Aunt Ellen had a
failure once, and my Aunt Ellen was a very clever woman, and one of
the delights of my childhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Aunt Ellen lived in the village and we
often went to see her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Uncle Abner was a blacksmith, but he only
worked in the afternoons.</Sentence> <Sentence>Uncle Abner had blue black curly hair, and
big blue eyes, and the longest moustache ever seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I sat behind
him I could see both ends.</Sentence> <Sentence>People said Uncle Abner was lazy, and
really good for nothing, but playing the fiddle at dances.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they
did not say that to Aunt Ellen, who adored him.</Sentence> <Sentence>People said she was
too proud to admit that she had made a bad bargain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Aunt Ellen said
people did not understand Abner.</Sentence> <Sentence>Naturally he liked company‚Äîwhy
shouldn‚Äôt he?</Sentence> <Sentence>He was the life of the party wherever he went; and when
he was out late so many evenings, he just had to sleep in in the
mornings.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he could do as much in an afternoon as most men did all
day.</Sentence> <Sentence>Uncle Abner made me a little basket from a walnut shell, and a
gold wire brooch with my initials.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother did not quite approve of
my Uncle Abner but she qualified her criticism by saying: ‚ÄúFor all
that, he has a nice way with him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Uncle Abner was frequently cited in
matrimonial arguments along the Garafraxa.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indignant husbands,
hard-working and steady, who felt they were being unduly criticized
for some slight misdemeanor, wished they were more ‚Äúlike Abner Patton
and then they might be appreciated, by gum.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Young Michael certainly had troubled the waters, with his stories of
the far West.</Sentence> <Sentence>All day long, while the work of the farm went on, at
high speed, not much was said, but at night the rafters in the kitchen
rang with words.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Unfortunately I had to go to bed, but Hannah relayed all to me, with
shrewd editorial comment, and long before any decision was reached,
told me she was sure we were going.</Sentence> <Sentence>She based this belief on the fiery
way mother was working.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was another quilt on the way; and the
leach was set up again.</Sentence> <Sentence>Arabella Cresine was coming to sew as soon as
she was through with the Charltons.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We began to be sorry for the young people who had to stay forever in
<Location>Grey County</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wondered what we would do with the dogs.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Aunt Ellen might take
them; they had two already, but a dog more or less did not matter.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Uncle Abner would like the brown spaniel, but not old Watch, who had
no beauty or grace, just a stern sense of duty.</Sentence> <Sentence>All day he watched for
hawks and answered the call of the hens.</Sentence> <Sentence>He never left the yard, never
played, never had any fun, never wagged his tail and nobody liked him
but mother, who said if he were young she wouldn‚Äôt take a hundred
dollars for him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap, the spaniel was a joyous pup, with silky brown
hair and creamy white trimmings.</Sentence> <Sentence>He could sit up and beg and bring
back sticks, and play ball; would not go after the cows, or chase a
hawk, or do anything useful, but he was light of heart and had a
welcoming bark for everyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father called him ‚Äúplay-boy,‚Äù and said
it was too bad that the two dogs could not be combined.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He explained all to me one day when I was picking potatoes for him in
the field between our house and the road.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said old Watch did not
need to be so cross and grim and suspicious, and Nap might easily
learn to be useful without losing one bit of his playful ways.</Sentence> <Sentence>People
were the same.</Sentence> <Sentence>And then he went on and said that was one reason why
Christ was sent to earth‚Äîto show people that a Christian might be,
indeed must be polite and pleasant, and full of fun and fond of music,
and pretty colors and yet serious too and earnest.</Sentence> <Sentence>And he told me to
think about this and try to combine the virtues of Watch and the
friendliness of Nap, in my own life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I asked him then if it were wrong for me to mock the aunts.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He stopped his work and looked over toward the house, before he
answered; his voice fell, as if he were afraid the wind might carry
it.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYour mother thinks it is,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúshe thinks it shows disrespect.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I do not think so.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are funny, queer stiff old ladies, set in
their ways and right in their own eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs no harm for you and me to
have a laugh over them, a laugh is as good as a meal or an hour‚Äôs
sleep.</Sentence> <Sentence>But perhaps we had better not offend your mother.</Sentence> <Sentence>We know that
would be wrong, we‚Äôll just keep it to ourselves and not be hurting
anyone‚Äôs feelings.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat makes mother like that?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked after awhile.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôs Scotch,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre very serious people, a little bit
stern, but the greatest people in the world for courage and backbone.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The Irish are different; not so steadfast or reliable, but very
pleasant.</Sentence> <Sentence>Irish people have had so much trouble, they‚Äôve had to sing
and dance, and laugh and fight to keep their hearts from breaking.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am glad you are Irish,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stopped picking and straightened
up.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a lovely autumn day, with a sky as blue as an enamel plate.</Sentence>
<Sentence>From the yard came the contented sounds of hens cackling and turkeys
gobbling.</Sentence> <Sentence>White clouds, with gray wrinklings idled over our heads.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
wind lifting the potato stocks made a dry rustling that subtly spoke
of winter, when there would be long dark days, with frozen window
panes and stinging winds that made it impossible to play outside.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
this day, full of the abundance of harvest was made for joy and
singing, and we went on with the digging and sang as we worked:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúShule, shule, shule, agra
    Its time can only aise me woe
  Since the lad o‚Äô me heart
    From me did part
  Schedate, avoureen, schlana.</Sentence>

  <Sentence>I‚Äôll dye me petticoat,
    I‚Äôll dye it red
  And through the world
    I‚Äôll beg me bread,
    I wish in me heart
    That I was dead.</Sentence>
    <Sentence>Schedate, avoureen, schlana.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The words were sad, but not the singers.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER V‚ÄîThe Decision</Sentence>


<Sentence>One day the whole question of emigration to the far away Red River was
suddenly decided.</Sentence> <Sentence>The vapor of argument and opinion suddenly lifted
and blew away, and before us stretched a straight hard road, from
which there could be no turning back.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The spring plowing was going on this bright windy day in May; and
because of the high wind and eddying dust I was playing in the
kitchen; I had just come over to the long table to watch mother
kneading her bread, which squeaked as the air-bubbles broke.</Sentence> <Sentence>All in a
moment the door flew open and Will came in, with a gust of wind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He must have made a dramatic entry, for I can remember that his face
was white and his eyes had turned strangely black.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother turned
around from the table and stood without speaking.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will threw his hat
on the floor and every sound in the house suddenly ceased.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am done!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he said, and his voice shook with rage.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI am quitting
right here!</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll never put another plow into the soil of <Location>Grey County</Location>,
I‚Äôll go west, if I have to walk!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother went to him and helped him to the sofa.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou are hurt Willie,‚Äù she said anxiously.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDid the plow hit a stone?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will nodded.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt knocked my wind out,‚Äù he said; ‚Äúa hidden
stone‚Äîthere‚Äôs no end to them, but I‚Äôm done.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve quit!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was no argument.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will would go at once and if he liked it we
would all go in a year.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The day Will left I cried bitter tears.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think every one cried but my
mother.</Sentence> <Sentence>She said there was no need of tears, we should be glad we had
a brother brave enough to go out West and find land for us, and we
would all be together soon, and there would be plenty to do in the
year getting ready for the big move, and there would be need of every
one, even to the youngest.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that meant I would have to go on
watering the leach.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We all walked out to the road with Will and waited for the stage,
which would take him to Owen Sound, and he would get on the _Francis
Smith_, the boat which sailed that night.</Sentence> <Sentence>He wore a pale grey shirt,
with a blue tie caught in a gold ring, and had a new grey felt hat and
carried the only valise we owned.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew he would conquer the world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next night came the storm which beat the _Francis Smith_ upon the
rocks.</Sentence> <Sentence>The gale came suddenly in the night and wakened me with great
flashes of lightning followed by peals of thunder that shook the
world.</Sentence> <Sentence>First a flash and then a burst of thunder and pelting rain in
one deafening confusion.</Sentence> <Sentence>I turned my face into the pillow, but could
still see the flashes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then the rumbles began to come from farther
away and the rain slackened too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Suddenly I thought of the boat and
sat up!</Sentence> <Sentence>Would the storm be on the Lakes?</Sentence> <Sentence>A flash of lightning showed
me mother kneeling by her bedside in her nightgown, her long dark hair
hanging down her back in two braids; and through the dark I heard her
praying: ‚ÄúThou, who didst walk the waters on the Sea of Galilee,‚Äù she
pleaded, ‚Äúwalk it again on <Location>Lake Superior</Location> and save the _Francis Smith_;
O, still the waves and let the passengers be saved, even if the vessel
is smashed to pieces on the rocks, stoop, O Saviour, stoop and save.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I prayed too, but my petition was a simple one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I made a little tent
of my hands before my face and whispered in the dark: ‚ÄúDear God, take
care of Will‚Äîhe‚Äôs my biggest brother and he‚Äôs going to find good land
for us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs a good fellow, and if he should get drowned we can‚Äôt go
West.</Sentence> <Sentence>Amen.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Having thus delivered myself I went to sleep again and slept till
morning.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew it would be all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>God would not go back on
mother.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father must have felt the same way, for he slept the night
through.</Sentence> <Sentence>At daylight mother wakened him and they drove into Owen Sound
and found that all the passengers had been taken off the ship, and a
few days later we got Will‚Äôs letter, telling us about the storm.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After that Will‚Äôs letters became the great events of our lives.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
joined a surveying party and was lucky to get on it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now he would see
the country and be able to choose the best land; he wouldn‚Äôt forget to
have a running stream on the farm and there would be good black loam.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He was well and happy and letting his whiskers grow.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>He found a place near the <Location>Souris River</Location>.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>We would write to Grand
View now and he would get it some time.</Sentence> <Sentence>We must not be anxious if we
did not hear from him, and would we give this letter to Annie
Stephenson to read?</Sentence> <Sentence>He had only one stamp.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>He would draw a map
of the township for us.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>He was going to camp in the bush with a man called Macdonald, and cut
logs for the house when the cold weather came.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe he would get a
chance to send a letter out, anyway he would be all right in the
camp‚Äîthere was plenty of firewood and they had a tin stove and lots of
pork and beans, and rabbits were plentiful.</Sentence> <Sentence>He hoped we could sell the
farm.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was plenty of good land there lying waste.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would come
to <Location>Winnipeg</Location> to meet us in May.</Sentence> . . .

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>In May, 1880, we all sailed on the _<Location>City</Location> of Owen Sound_, I remember
taking leave of the old home which had been bought by a man named
Crawford.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was dressed in my best dress, the day we left, for I was
going to have my picture taken in Owen Sound.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a black and white
farmer‚Äôs satin, second mourning for my grandmother who had died the
year before.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had white cotton stockings, knit in a feather pattern,
and high laced boots.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The neighbors helped us to draw our stuff into Owen Sound.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and
I rode with Caleb Morgan, Mr. Conger‚Äôs hired man.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a bleak windy
day, with light clouds rolling, but we were warmly wrapped in a
blanket and sat on the high spring seat with Caleb.</Sentence> <Sentence>He confided to us
as we rattled along that he fully intended to get out West himself
sometime, but what could a man do with his mother and two sisters to
support?</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother and father rode in our own wagon ahead, driven by Mr. Crawford,
who had bought the horses and wagon, and was helping us now to get our
stuff on the boat.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stopped in Chatsworth and went into the cemetery.</Sentence> <Sentence>On grandmother‚Äôs
grave mother put a wreath of paper flowers, in a little box with a
glass lid, which Arabella Cresine had made for her.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a new
white stone with her name, ‚ÄúMargaret Fullerton McCurdy.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù There was a
little grave beside grandmother‚Äôs with a white lamb at the head and
this was where the little brother, John Wesley, whom I had never seen,
was laid.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been there before and knew about this little fellow,
who was the smartest, best child of us all, and one Sunday he had come
home from Sunday-school with his Berean Leaf and said his verse, ‚ÄúLet
not your heart be troubled,‚Äù and he was dead at noon on Tuesday.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
tried to feel sad when I looked at the little stone.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>mother
cried when she knelt beside the little mound and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not
leaving you Johnny, for you‚Äôre safe in heaven, and I carry your memory
in my heart and always will .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>and when the other children all grow
up and leave me, I‚Äôll still have my wee bairn.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>And when my time
comes you will be the angel sent out to meet me, and you will say your
verse to me then.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Near Inglis Falls we stopped again to say good-bye to the McMickens,
who kept the tavern there.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. McMicken was my father‚Äôs niece, and
Robert her boy, eighteen years old was sick with consumption.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
grown too fast.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were great deers‚Äô heads of the hall, and a
cabinet of stuffed birds on the landing of the stairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were all
taken in to say good-bye to Robert, who lay as white as the pillows on
his high bed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In Owen Sound, Hannah, Lizzie and I stayed at Mary Little‚Äôs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mary had
gone from our neighborhood some years ago and set herself up in
dressmaking, and had done well.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a thin darting little woman
with a heart-shaped pincushion of red velvet hanging from her leather
belt.</Sentence> <Sentence>Across from her house was a great yellow house, whose eaves and
windows and verandah were all edged with wooden lace.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At Silver Inlet, we went ashore to see a cousin, who had the name of
being a bad housekeeper.</Sentence> <Sentence>She read novels, paper-backed novels, day and
night and would neither knit nor sew.</Sentence> <Sentence>Novels were a form of poison.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew that, but mother spoke well of poor Lucy in spite of her
weakness.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was as good-natured a soul as ever lived, and would be a
good woman, if she could only leave the cursed novels alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe she
had done better in her new home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, we would call and see her for
the boat stayed two hours.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We trailed up a long hill, with a narrow sidewalk of two boards and
houses standing one above another.</Sentence> <Sentence>We found Lucy‚Äôs house quite easily.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There were no curtains on the windows and boards in the steps were
broken, but that was not Lucy‚Äôs fault‚Äîsurely Johnny should have mended
the steps, but it seems the novels had got Johnny too, not that he
read them, but Lucy didn‚Äôt get the right sort of meals and Johnny had
lost heart, so he couldn‚Äôt be expected to mend the steps.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lucy came to
the door in bedroom slippers and a Mother Hubbard wrapper, and her
hair was in curl papers, though this was late afternoon.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was very
glad to see us, and took us into the little parlor, where the
furniture wore grey linen dusters, and the pictures were crooked on
the wall.</Sentence> <Sentence>But her house was warm; and from the bare window looking out
on the street, we could see the blue waters of the harbor, and our big
white boat waiting for us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lucy made a cup of tea for us and served us
biscuits, ‚Äúboughten biscuits,‚Äù but lovely to the taste.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lucy was very
sweet and pleasant, and told mother she was late with her
housecleaning this Spring, but she was going to get right at it as
soon as she finished the book she was reading‚Äîsuch a lovely story
about an orphan who was the real heir to her grandfather‚Äôs millions.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But do you think her uncles would let her have the money?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äîthey had
laid traps for her in every way, and now they were plotting with the
gypsies to steal her, and her so young and sweet and innocent.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even
the old gypsy woman was better than her own uncles, and had come by
night to see Dolores‚Äîthat was the orphan‚Äîto tell her not to drink‚Äî</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother interrupted Lucy there just when it was getting interesting,
and asked for Johnny, and Lucy said that Johnny was the ‚Äúsame old
tuppenny bit.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I liked Lucy.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had a cat too, a big furry one, black and white,
which lay on the top of the sideboard among the newspapers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stayed until our boat gave its deep-throated whistle to warn us
that one hour had gone, and then mother hurried us out.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to
find out about Dolores, the orphan, and what it was she mustn‚Äôt drink,
but I never knew.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The boat carried us as far as <Location>Duluth</Location>, and again we climbed a hill‚Äîthis
time to find a store, for we had to carry our own food on the train.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
had ten cents of my own too, which was causing me some anxiety.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
bought maple sugar with it, and rued my bargain immediately, for there
were many other things I would have preferred, but maple sugar was the
first thing offered to me, and I did not wish to hurt the clerk‚Äôs
feelings.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah was indignant with me for letting my money go so easily.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe
have better maple sugar than that with us,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmaple sugar is
no treat, anyway, when we can make it ourselves.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI like this,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúlook at the scallops around the edge, and I
think it will have a different taste from ours!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou haven‚Äôt much sense,‚Äù Hannah said, and I knew it was true.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I
stuck to my bargain and pretended I was satisfied, remembering Aunt
Ellen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The train journey from <Location>Duluth</Location> to St. Boniface passed like a flash.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
there were pullmans on this train, they were not used by us.</Sentence> <Sentence>We slept
very comfortably on the seats, for we had pillows and blankets.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our
only trouble was that the car was crowded, but I slept very well for a
man across the aisle offered to take me, for he was alone in the seat,
and made a nice bed for me on his buffalo coat.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was afraid he
might steal me and so did not close an eye all night, but no such
thought kept me from my slumber.</Sentence> <Sentence>I asked him to please waken me when
we crossed the <Location>Mississippi</Location>, and I told him boastfully, I fear, that I
could spell ‚ÄúMississippi,‚Äù and proceeded to do so, and having gone
thus far in making a contact with the great waterway, it was only
natural that I should want to see it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He promised to waken me, if he
could stay awake himself.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said we would cross the river in
daylight, just about daybreak, but he would find out for sure.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was pretty drowsy when he gently stirred and called me, and I knew
it would be a chance of a lifetime.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told me we would be on the
bridge in a minute.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was in the dull gray of a misty Spring morning;
discolored snow lined the yellow clay banks, and the great current of
water billowed and threshed and churned its way under us, as the train
crawled slowly over the bridge.</Sentence> <Sentence>The air was full of its clamoring roar
as my friend held me up so I could see through the clear glass in the
top half of the window, and I flattened my nose on it, in my eagerness
to see all I could of the turmoil below me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI know what it is like,‚Äù I said, when the train had passed the last
trestle, and began to pick up speed on the level track, and I was
crawling back into the fur coat.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He expressed his readiness to hear.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSoft soap,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhen it is just ready to boil over and folding
up from the bottom.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI have never seen soft soap,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhere did you see it?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to tell him about the leach with the black pan under it, but
my eyes were heavy with sleep, so I just waved my hand across the
aisle.</Sentence> <Sentence>If he wanted information, there was the original soap-maker:
she could tell him the story of soap from the beginning.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER VI‚ÄîWe Arrive</Sentence>


<Sentence>We arrived in St. Boniface at night, a close hot May night with no
moon.</Sentence> <Sentence>There seemed to be no place to stay, so we crossed the river in
a row-boat.</Sentence> <Sentence>Timoleon Tait‚Äôs ferry did not start to run until later in
the season.</Sentence> <Sentence>The seven of us, with our hand baggage were packed in the
boat, and I remember trailing my hands in the cold water, which seemed
very nearly up to the edge of the boat.</Sentence> <Sentence>We found a hotel that would
take us in and let us spread our bedding on the floor, every bed being
occupied, and here, sleepy and tired we lay down.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when daylight
came, and my mother saw what sort of a place we were in we made a
hurried exit.</Sentence> <Sentence>She must have been greatly shaken at the sight, for she
imparted to each of us a great desire to get out.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think it was
probably her first sight of old and unashamed dirt.</Sentence> <Sentence>The bill was
fifteen dollars.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our next place of sojourn was a delightful one‚Äîa tent on the river
bank, where all day we could see the activities of both the Red and
Assiniboine, for our camping-ground was at the junction of these two
rivers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Many other settlers were camped there, and we were welcomed by
the older residents and every assistance was given to us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Before three
days had gone by we had a floored tent, with a stove, home-made table,
a clothesline and bunks around the sides of the tent, and knew all the
other families.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother set to work to wash the bedding, bit by bit,
for the memory of that one night in the Browse Hotel had to be purged
away by soap and water and the high bright sunshine of the river bank.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were not overlooked by the purveyors of <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>A butcher‚Äôs cart
came down to us twice a week with beefsteak at seventy-five cents a
pound, and an enterprising dairyman led two cows through the
encampment and sold milk at thirty cents a quart, cafeteria style.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Land agents with pockets bulging with documents swarmed about us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our great excitement was the river boats passing on both rivers; some
side-wheelers and some with the propeller behind, great red and white
boats churning the muddy water of the river into creamy foam.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
landings were made by throwing out a cable, when the boat had come as
near to the shore as the water allowed and letting off the deckhands
called ‚ÄúRoosters,‚Äù who tugged at the cables and drew the boat to
shore.</Sentence> <Sentence>The landings were accomplished in torrents of profanity,
directed toward the Roosters who worked away patiently and without
resentment; one of our tent-neighbors said the captains seemed to be
even-tempered men, always in a rage.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were three days in the tent when Will came with our cousin John
Clarke, a young man about Will‚Äôs age, who looked like him too, and
when these two sunburned young fellows in their high boots, with
whiskers on their faces came in, and hailed us as their own and we
knew that we were all together again, our happiness was complete.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now
let the hurricane roar, we were here!</Sentence> <Sentence>We had reached the <Location>Red River</Location> and
the world was ours!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember lying in bed in the tent trying to keep awake when Will was
telling about the time he had spent at the Junction of the Assiniboine
and Souris, that terrible winter of ‚Äô79-80 when the frost split the
trees wide open, and they cracked like pistol-shots, and the northern
lights pink and gold, and green, waved and fluttered in the sky like
curtains hung on a clothesline on a windy day.</Sentence> <Sentence>The stove was kept
red-hot but even so his back was freezing while his face burned.</Sentence> <Sentence>And
the wolves circled and howled, and snapped their hungry jaws outside
the tent, some so near to him that he never ceased to be frightened
they would get an ear or a toe, and the two ponies died, although they
had made a shelter of logs for them, and covered it with spruce
boughs, but they had breathed the frost into their lungs.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>After
that no one spoke for so long that I fell asleep.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But most of all we wanted to hear of the land Will had taken for us‚Äîa
half-section for himself and one for father, and a quarter for George,
all together.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ours was section 20, township 7, range 16, and Will drew
a diagram to show us how the sections were laid out, drawing in the
running stream that cut through our farm, and circled to make a
perfect building site.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Oxen had to be bought now, and two wagons and some place had to be
found for us to live.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will‚Äôs plan was for the family to stay in
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> while he and father and George would take part of the
furniture and drive the hundred-and-eighty miles, build a house with
the logs he and Macdonald had cut down and dressed, and then come back
for us in September, before the cold weather came.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother wanted to keep us all together and go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We could live in the
tent while the house was being built, but Will was afraid of the
mosquitoes, lack of good water and the general discouragement which
might fall upon us.</Sentence> <Sentence>So a house was found, five miles from <Location>Winnipeg</Location> at
Saint James.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a big, old house with a smoking chimney and a
tragic history.</Sentence> <Sentence>Its owner had been shot through one of the windows and
the mystery had never been cleared up.</Sentence> <Sentence>The great attraction for us was
the fine garden, already ploughed and ready for planting, and this was
set with seeds before the men left for their long journey.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Beside us was Sir Donald A. Smith‚Äôs house, ‚ÄúSilver Heights,‚Äù a
beautiful manor house, surrounded by lawns and flowers and white
trellised arbors, with long gabled stables at the back of the grounds.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Often in the evening many carriages turned in at the gates, phaetons
with wide fenders, covered carriages with lamps on the dash-boards
carrying brilliantly dressed people to dance in the great ballroom on
the second floor, and on these nights Hannah and I, who went to bed
early, would hang half-way out of our room window, listening to the
ribbony notes of the violins playing the Blue Danube Waltz and
watching the swaying figures of the dancers.</Sentence> <Sentence>We named them and wove
romances around them giving them as happy destinies as we thought they
deserved.</Sentence> <Sentence>They drew better fortunes from us on the nights they forgot
to draw the blue velvet hangings, thus preserving for us a good view
of the enchanted ballroom.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes we fancied that proposals of
marriage transpired before our eyes in the alcove, and we rehearsed
the scene with words of our own making.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLorelie‚Äîmay I call you
Lorelie?</Sentence> <Sentence>Your loveliness has haunted me since first you crossed my
path‚Äîand not one peaceful hour have I known since then, so now I must,
and will know my fate.</Sentence> <Sentence>Is there a spark of hope that you might grow to
love a rough warrior?</Sentence> <Sentence>Nay do not shrink!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>To which I, as Lorelie, made reply with downcast eyes and blushes
mantling my snowy brow, ‚ÄúHow do I know‚ÄîI am so young‚Äîso ignorant of
the world‚ÄîSir Hector, I have so lately left my lessons.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then we had another scene where Lorelie wept and confessed she loved
another, one of humble birth, and Sir Hector promised to seek out the
handsome herd-boy and make him his heir; so her father‚Äôs objections
would be removed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Whereupon Lorelie fell at his feet and embraced his
knees and cried until Sir Hector, although a little stiff in the back,
stooped and lifted her and wiped her tears with his own bandana
handkerchief, drawn from the tail of his coat with a crack like a
whip-lash.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah had invented this scene, to show off her trick of
snapping a handkerchief.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Our first intimation of the evil character of the house was brought in
by Jack, who said the boys he played with wouldn‚Äôt come in for there
was a curse on the house, and a ghost in the attic that moaned in the
night.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother did not seem to be worried over either the curse or the ghost.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Hannah and I were greatly thrilled to be living in a house that had a
ghost‚Äîthat was something surely and we were not afraid, not at the
moment for night was a long way off and the sun was shining.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway,
Mother said a person who had a good conscience need not be afraid of
ghosts, even if there were ghosts, which she did not believe.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But one night there came a storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>The wind came down on us, with
sudden fury, bending the poplar trees across the windows, and shaking
every loose window in our house.</Sentence> <Sentence>We used only two rooms downstairs and
two upstairs, for, having sent all the furniture we could do without,
on the wagons, we were managing with the scant necessities.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were all downstairs when the gale struck, and at first we watched
the tossing trees and the rolling clouds from the front windows.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Suddenly the whole house burst into groans, rolling higher and higher
and then dying into agonized whispers.</Sentence> <Sentence>We turned from the window in a
panic of fear.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother stood up and listened with her brows drawn down
and every sense alert.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then she shook her head and went out into the
hall.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sounds certainly were coming from upstairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were sure it
was the ghost, or a collection of ghosts, but not a word was spoken
until mother announced her intention of finding out.</Sentence> <Sentence>We formed a
procession, Jack walking ahead carrying the lamp.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother followed with
an ax.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie, Hannah and I fell in.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not want to go, but it
would be worse to stay behind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The moans did not belong to the first floor but came from the attic,
rising and falling with every gust.</Sentence> <Sentence>A blaze of lightning blotted out
the yellow lamplight, leaving us almost blinded.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a door to
the attic, always locked, but mother had all the keys with her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
found the key, unlocked the door and opened it.</Sentence> <Sentence>A rush of wind put out
the light.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI think I know what the trouble is,‚Äù she said; ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no ghost.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll go down and get the matches,‚Äù Jack volunteered, and I thought it
was very brave of him.</Sentence> <Sentence>But mother did not need a light.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNever mind, I‚Äôll go up and close the windows, the lightning will show
the way.</Sentence> <Sentence>Don‚Äôt be afraid, it‚Äôs nothing!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stayed below and heard her steps on the bare floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were
continuous flashes of lightning.</Sentence> <Sentence>In a few minutes we heard her coming
and her voice had a note of victory.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNothing at all,‚Äù she said, ‚Äújust
bottles in the windows with their necks turned out, and when the wind
blew it roared in and out.</Sentence> <Sentence>I let the windows down, so we‚Äôll hear no
more groans.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went down the stairs and back to the kitchen, where a cheerful fire
burned in the stove and the lamplight never looked more welcome.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI
think I‚Äôll have a cup of tea, and you may have hot milk,‚Äù mother said,
‚Äúand we‚Äôll sit down a while and read our book.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs not late yet and
we don‚Äôt feel like sleeping.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The storm went on but the sounds in the house had settled down to what
night sounds should be when the rain pours down, and the wind is
riding the trees.</Sentence> <Sentence>And we had a fine long evening following the
fortunes of the ‚ÄúScottish Chiefs.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before the men of the family had left for the West, a farm for sale
was offered to us, <Location>Louis</Location> Pruden‚Äôs farm on the river-bank‚Äîfour chains
wide, as all the farms were, and four miles long‚Äîlaid out in this way
to provide river frontage for everyone and to make it possible for the
houses to be close together.</Sentence> <Sentence>The price was sixteen hundred dollars,
which was about all we had after the oxen, waggons and supplies were
bought.</Sentence> <Sentence>We could buy it on easy terms, and Will saw possibilities in
the venture.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe could sell it in a year and double our money,‚Äù Will said.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThis land will be sold for town lots in ten years,‚Äù father said, who
was favorable to the project.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWinnipeg will be one of the great
cities of <Location>Canada</Location>, and nothing can prevent it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But mother stood firm.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLet us go on,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLet us go to an
all-white settlement.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are too many jet black eyes and high
cheek-bones here.</Sentence> <Sentence>I like them very well when they belong to the
neighbors‚Äô children, but I would not like them in my grand-children.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We came here, John, for the children‚Äôs sake, not ours, and we‚Äôll do
our best for them every way.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt see why she objected.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indian Tommy was the nicest boy we
played with, and the McMullen children were all right too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indian
Tommy‚Äôs mother worked in the kitchen of <Location>Silver Heights</Location>, so quite often
he came over and played with us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He could whistle like a meadowlark
and climb any tree on the place, and after he lost his two front
teeth, he could spit right through a knot-hole in the fence.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Indian Tommy‚Äôs mother did not like another woman, called Mrs. Baggs,
because Mrs. Baggs said Indian Tommy‚Äôs mother had never been drunk in
her life and she had been roaring drunk once in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>This started
the quarrel, and when they fought on the river bank, Tommy took me
over to see it, and all would have been well if I had not brought home
the news, but unfortunately, I did.</Sentence> <Sentence>Naturally I was glad to see my
friend‚Äôs mother win and chase her enemy, almost into the river.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Something told me, though, as I went on with my story that I was not
‚Äúgetting my audience.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù From then on, I was not allowed to go out of
our own grounds unless Hannah or Lizzie was with me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But there was good fun in playing inside, when Hannah would play with
me.</Sentence> <Sentence>We climbed the poplar trees which were just the right size for a
lovely game that Hannah invented.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had two trees that were near
enough to strike when we got them teetering and then the game was to
see who could first knock the other one down.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a lovely game and
its name was, ‚ÄúBiting the Dust.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother and Jack attended to the garden and it responded with a
prodigality of growth which must have warmed their hearts.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rich black
soil for a seed-bed, with plenty of rain and warm sunshine, made the
plants grow with great vigor, and I believe this kept mother‚Äôs spirits
high that summer more than anything else, for she must have had her
times of loneliness.</Sentence> <Sentence>The mosquitoes were like all the plagues of the
Old Testament but no matter, the hoeing and weeding went on, for these
rows of carrots, beets, onions and potatoes would all be needed in the
long winter that lay ahead.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER VII‚ÄîOn the Trail</Sentence>


<Sentence>When the first of September came, we began to watch the Portage road.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Our men might come any day now.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had a pound cake made and set
away in a crock, and the bread supply was not allowed to fall below
three loaves and the stove got blackened every day.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One Saturday evening, as the sun was going down in a wine red mist, I
saw two ox-wagons come over the rise in the Portage road, beyond the
McMullen farm.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sure it was our wagons, but I had been sure so
many times before and utterly disappointed when the wagons went past,
that I watched and said nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was the only one on guard at the
moment, and I hoped every one would stay where they were so I could
have the ‚Äúscoop.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I wanted to run down to the road, but I had done
that before and there was no luck in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I turned my head away and
counted fifty before I looked.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were still coming!</Sentence> <Sentence>I counted
another fifty and with masterly self control, refrained from sound or
motion even though I could see a red ox, with a red and white ox, a
red ox with a black and white ox.</Sentence> <Sentence>It must be them!</Sentence> <Sentence>I had to stuff my
sunbonnet into my mouth to keep from raising the glad shout.</Sentence> <Sentence>At last
the first wagon turned in‚Äîand I lifted the alarm, which brought the
other members of the family flying.</Sentence> <Sentence>They thought I had been stung by a
bee Jack said afterwards, and then, to lift forever the bad name which
was sometimes urged against me that I never did anything without being
told, I dashed out into the backyard to pick up chips for the fire,
but in the general excitement my good deed was not even noticed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father and Will had come, leaving George behind to look after the
place.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>However the evening had one bright aspect.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was so much talk, I
sat up unobserved until ten, by making myself small, and quiet and I
heard that we must be on our way in a week, and that father said he
was glad we had not come with them in the spring, for between the
smoke of the smudges and the mosquito bites there wasn‚Äôt much to
choose, and that we were going to get a pony and cart for it would
save the oxen, and be a quicker way of getting around, when we got
home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were trips into <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, to buy supplies and I got a pair of
stout shoes with copper toes, so big I had to pad my feet below and
around with newspaper.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would grow into them!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Sunday before we left we all went to church, walking the mile to
the little English church of which Mr. Pinkham was the rector.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had
attended there all summer and Mr. Pinkham had come to see us.</Sentence> <Sentence>We said
good-bye to the friends we had made: Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, Mr. and
Mrs. Buckley and the Tait family‚ÄîMr.</Sentence> <Sentence>and Mrs. Robert Tait, Herbie,
Ellen and Addie.</Sentence> <Sentence>Addie was a little older than I, a tall girl with
reddish hair, who always had money and seemed to me like a princess in
disguise.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think she bought candy every day at the store and in the
mixture, when hard candies with a centre like flour paste appeared she
threw them away.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ah me!</Sentence> <Sentence>I would have been glad of them, but of course,
I couldn‚Äôt take Addie‚Äôs ‚Äúleavings,‚Äù so I heaped scorn on them too, but
it was hard to forget them, in the candyless years that followed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We left on Monday morning, early, with the poplar leaves stirring in
the light of the rising sun.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a glorious morning, with a smell
all its own, dead leaves, ripening again, coffee and bacon, new boots
and something else, maybe just adventure, the magic of the unknown.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The garden from which every last vegetable had been taken lay ruffled
and tossed like an unmade bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were all ready to start when father
declared the garden would have to be levelled and raked.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was
some dissension about this, but it was done.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSure, and it has served us well,‚Äù he said, as he raked the stalks
into a windrow, ‚Äúand it is only common civility to leave it smooth and
in order for the people who come after us.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I‚Äôd rather cheat a
person any day, than cheat the land.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had two wagonloads of ‚ÄúSettler‚Äôs Effects,‚Äù‚Äîwhich was a broad term
that included anything from a plow to a paper of pins.</Sentence> <Sentence>The little
oxen, Jake and Brin, went first, for theirs was the lighter load of
the two.</Sentence> <Sentence>In their wagon, wrapped in canvas and tarpaulins, were the
things that would not be needed on the journey, flour, bacon, dried
vegetables, extra bedding, chairs, tables, boxes of clothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the
covered wagon, which the big oxen drew were the necessities for the
days of travel, bedding, dry wood, frying pans, pots, clothing, ox
harness, whiffletrees, a neckyoke, tools, spades for digging out mud
holes, an ax, ropes and chains, and one bed made up and ready ‚Äúin case
of sickness.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Never had I experienced as great a moment as came to me, when the
oxen‚Äôs heads were turned west on <Location>Portage Avenue</Location> and the long trail
received us unto itself.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt that life was leading me by the hand
and I followed on light feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>We would travel with the sun, until we
came to that flower starred prairie where no stone would impede the
plow; where strawberries would redden the oxen‚Äôs fetlocks; where
eight-hundred acres of rich black soil was waiting for us, and a
running stream would stir the cat-tails in the current and I would
have a little boat on it, with white sails and on hot days I could
wade in its cool waters, and there would be shady pools and big trees,
where I could build a seat and go there and read, when I learned to
read, and it would be far enough away from the house, I could not hear
any one calling me, and it would be almost the same as having a room
of my own.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>We walked as much as we could, riding only when we got tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
believe my mother walked all the way, for she liked to have her eye on
the whole procession and she could only do this from the rear.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was hot when the sun climbed higher in the sky, but there came
heavy banks of clouds that gave us periods of shade and the faithful
oxen plodded on, at their own unhurried pace.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wild geese passed into
the south to remind us that winter was on our heels, but nothing could
dim the radiance of that day of high adventure.</Sentence>

<Sentence>White-washed, Red-river frame houses, set in wide farm yards, well
back from the road, stacks of hay and fields of ripe grain with men
cutting it down with reapers, and in some fields with sickles and
cradles‚Äîthen long stretches of meadows, growing brown with autumn and
then more houses.</Sentence> <Sentence>Over all the odor of wild sage, and golden rod, that
grew beside the road, and in the air flights of crows and black-birds
visiting the scattered grain fields, and sitting on wire fences, like
strings of jet beads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wondered how these people could be content to stay on their little
farms when there was better land ahead.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps they did not know.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Will had said their land was too heavy with gumbo and alkali to ever
make easy farming, but they liked living close together with the river
at their front door; and had their little circle of friends, and
simple pleasures.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Part of the glow I felt in beginning this journey, came from the sense
I had that we were well dressed for the occasion.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had dark print
dresses and straw hats, lined with the same print as our dresses and
banded with a fold of it, dark gray ribbed woolen stockings, hand
knit, and good stout boots.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then we had olive green coats, made of
homespun, mother‚Äôs own weaving, with smoked pearl buttons.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember
these coats well, as well I may, for when I grew out of mine I stepped
into Hannah‚Äôs and when it proved inadequate, I got Lizzie‚Äôs, so that
olive green homespun with pearl buttons was my portion in coats until
I was fifteen years old.</Sentence> <Sentence>My Aunt Ellen had made them and they were
good-looking coats.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The bad roads began at Baie <Location>St. Paul</Location>, a great swampy place, dreaded by
all prairie travellers.</Sentence> <Sentence>We met there, a tragic family who had turned
back, discouraged and beaten.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the wife who had broken down.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
wore a black silk dress and lace shawl and a pair of fancy shoes, all
caked with mud.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would have been a pretty woman if she would only
stop crying.</Sentence> <Sentence>She hated the country, she sobbed, it was only fit for
Indians and squaws and should never have been taken from them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her two
little girls were crying too.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had broken their garters and their
legs were a mass of mosquito bites.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was very sorry for their distress and tried to calm the weeping
woman.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre not dressed right for a journey like this,‚Äù she began.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one
can be happy going through mud in a fine silk dress and thin kid
shoes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut these are the oldest things I have,‚Äù she protested tearfully,
‚Äúand I don‚Äôt care if they do get spoiled.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut your shoes are not comfortable,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúand they are no
protection to your feet, and you should have made yourself some print
or gingham dresses.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut I can‚Äôt!</Sentence> <Sentence>I never made a dress in my life, mother always did my
sewing,‚Äù‚Äîand from her eyes came another freshet.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI want to go back to
her; she never wanted me to come, but I thought it would be fun, and
Willard was so crazy to get land of his own, but he can get his job
back at the store.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother‚Äôs zeal began to flag, ‚ÄúTake her back,‚Äù she said to Willard,
‚Äúshe‚Äôs not the type that makes a pioneer.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Willard nodded his head grimly, ‚ÄúI see that,‚Äù‚Äîhe said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother invited them to stay and eat with us, for we were stopped for
the noon meal and while she was making a bannock in the mouth of a
flour sack, Will fried the bacon and made coffee; and Lizzie put Balm
of Gilead salve on the little girls‚Äô mosquito bitten legs and mended
their garters.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúPoor Willard,‚Äù mother said, as we saw them drifting down the backward
trail.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe‚Äôll go on selling papers of pins and yards of tarleton, but
all his life he‚Äôll dream of the yellow wheat fields that might have
been his and his heart will wither with longing.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he made the
mistake many good men have made‚Äîhe married a painted doll, instead of
a woman.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôs a pretty little thing too,‚Äù my father said, looking after the
wagon receding in the distance‚Äî‚Äúdid you ever see a neater ankle?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>At High Bluff we bought a pony and cart, a Red-river cart that had not
a nail in it, and whose wooden axle had never known the soothing touch
of axle-grease.</Sentence> <Sentence>It rumbled and mourned, and creaked, and whined, as it
turned protestingly.</Sentence> <Sentence>We bought the pony from a Methodist minister
there, the Reverend Mr. Bray.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Ten miles was a good day‚Äôs travelling.</Sentence> <Sentence>One day we made only one mile.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At Poplar Point we camped beside the home of Chatsworth people, who
had left our neighborhood years before.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had written to Mrs.
Lance, but no reply had come, but Margaret Lance was the sort of woman
who would not write and mother was not offended.</Sentence> <Sentence><Location>Margaret Lane</Location> she was
before her marriage and the belle of the country side, who could have
married any man she wanted; but mother said, ‚Äúyou can go through the
woods and go through the woods and pick up a crooked stick at last.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
So when Johnny Lance came back from the <Location>North West</Location>, black as an
Indian, and his hair hanging down to his shoulder, bragging that he
had come to pick out a wife to take back with him, <Location>Margaret Lane</Location>,
(engaged to be married to Billy Spicer, who owned the farm next to her
father‚Äôs), spoke right up and said she would go.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone thought it
was a joke, but in a week they were married and away‚Äîand word drifted
back that Margaret said it was the best day‚Äôs work she had ever done
for herself.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We knew they were now living at Poplar Point, so we would go to see
them when we were so near.</Sentence>

<Sentence>They lived half a mile from the trail, in a long log house on the bank
of a creek.</Sentence> <Sentence>We stopped our wagons on the other side of the creek which
was running swiftly under the rough bridge and waited there on the
bank opposite their house, while mother and father went across the
bridge and up the bank to the house, attended by three barking dogs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When Mrs. Lance came out of the kitchen door, there was a flurry of
wings in the farm yard and hens and ducks raced toward her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Watching
from the wagons we saw the meeting, though we could hear nothing above
the uproar.</Sentence> <Sentence>A few black haired children came out of the house, the
eldest boy vainly trying to quiet the dogs.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a large duck
pond on the side of the creek next the house, where a flock of ducks
were feeding, but they, hearing the commotion, climbed out of the
water and waddled up in a body to find out what it was all about,
making raucous comments as they went.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were taken into the house and there we saw that although Mrs. Lance
had not written she was expecting us.</Sentence> <Sentence>The kitchen table held a fresh
baking of bread, and after the greetings were over, the eldest boy was
sent out to catch and kill two chickens.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the pattern of their farm buildings.</Sentence> <Sentence>The house was on one
side of the creek; and the hen house and stables on the other.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we
asked why they had built them this way, Mrs. Lance said she thought it
best to keep the animals across the creek by themselves and while she
said it, a hen and chickens walked in the door of the kitchen.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe
keep her in the woodshed,‚Äù Mrs. Lance said, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs late with her
chickens; this is her second flock and I‚Äôm trying to build them up
before winter.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs just time for her boiled wheat and she knows it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The hen cackled and stormed, sounding a hawk-alarm when she saw us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lance apologized.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt like strangers,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut
don‚Äôt mind her, she is really a very friendly hen when she gets to
know you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>On the top of the high oven a tin milk pan lined with hay contained
three young ducks that had been drenched with rain, Mrs. Lance said,
and had nearly died, but if she could just get them feathered out
before the cold weather, they would be all right.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt you find it a long way over to the stables, down one hill and
up another, with the creek to cross?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù mother asked, ‚Äúhow do you manage
in the spring when the water is high?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh!</Sentence> <Sentence>Johnny has a raft and it never lasts very long, maybe a week‚Äîhe
likes it‚Äî‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúJohnny does like a bit of excitement, and the
boys are the same.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs so fond of animals‚Äîand he likes them around
him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôd have the house full of them, if I would let him.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I
don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll be long here, there‚Äôs people coming to settle near
us and he doesn‚Äôt like to be crowded.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We made our camp across the creek and stayed that day and night.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs.
Lance roasted chickens, boiled potatoes and filled our food boxes to
overflowing, when we left.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Johnny himself arrived home in the afternoon, with a bag of wild
fowl‚Äîhe had been away shooting on the marsh, and gave us a riotous
welcome.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why couldn‚Äôt we stay a week, and go shooting prairie chickens
on the plains?</Sentence> <Sentence>They were as thick as you ever saw black-birds in the
oat fields in <Location>Ontario</Location>, and so tame, it was a crime to shoot them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We could not stay.</Sentence> <Sentence>The weather might break any day and we were only
half way on our journey.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWell, the <Location>North West</Location> is the place to live,‚Äù Johnny said, as he drove
the hen and chickens out and shut the door.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe Garafraxa would choke
me now, if I went back.</Sentence> <Sentence>A man needs freedom!</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs what drove me out,
and will drive me out again.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs different with women!</Sentence> <Sentence>They never had
freedom and so never miss it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll have to sell this place pretty soon
and move on.</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs been two or three land lookers around this
summer; wouldn‚Äôt you like to buy this place John and settle down, and
we‚Äôll go on to the Souris?</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs about time for us to move isn‚Äôt it
Maggie?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She shook her head.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe trouble with me is, I won‚Äôt take dictation from anyone,‚Äù Johnny
said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúOver here two miles away they‚Äôre startin‚Äô a school.</Sentence> <Sentence>That will
mean taxes and what do we need a school for?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat about your children, don‚Äôt you want them to go to school?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
mother asked indignantly.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Johnny was pressing tobacco into a black pipe, with his broad thumb.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMy boys can get all the education they need from me,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúAnd
what good is it for girls?</Sentence> <Sentence>Makes them want to read books, when they
should be patchin‚Äô quilts; Maggie here, would be a happier woman if
she couldn‚Äôt read at all.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother untied her apron before she replied to this.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe only thing we live for is our children,‚Äù she said in her Scotch
voice, ‚Äúand if we fail them, we have failed altogether.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every child
has a right to an education and if you do not get that for them, you
have cheated them.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre movin‚Äô the wrong way,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif its education you‚Äôre
after.</Sentence> <Sentence>There will be no schools out west where you‚Äôre headin‚Äô, for
years.</Sentence> <Sentence>It will be like the bush in <Location>Grey County</Location> forty years ago when my
folks went in.</Sentence> <Sentence>The schools came too late for me, and when they came, I
was too big to go, but I don‚Äôt know as I mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve done all right.</Sentence>
<Sentence>One generation gets missed out in every new settlement, and you‚Äôll
find that out too.</Sentence> <Sentence>The thing is not to get too much education in the
next.</Sentence> <Sentence>It makes too wide a gap.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt want my kids to get feeling
they know more than I do; not that it would hurt me, but it wouldn‚Äôt
be good for the kids.</Sentence> <Sentence>You women are all the same‚Äîall for learnin‚Äô, but
I want my boys to stay with me, and this is one way to keep them.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Ignorance holds families together.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean it Johnny!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù mother said at last.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one could be so
selfish as this, or as foolish‚Äù.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúI do mean it!</Sentence> <Sentence>Look what education does for people!</Sentence> <Sentence>A man in the
Portage forged a cheque and is in jail for it, a good fellow too,
would he have done that if he had never learned to write?</Sentence> <Sentence>He had an
idea he was smart‚Äîknew a little more than the rest of us.</Sentence> <Sentence>And if you
do read a newspaper‚Äîwhat do you get?</Sentence> <Sentence>Murders, horse thieving,
devilment of one kind or another.</Sentence> <Sentence>What good does her readin‚Äô do
Maggie, here?</Sentence> <Sentence>Upsets her that‚Äôs all.</Sentence> <Sentence>Gets her feeling too big for her
boots.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was too much for mother to stand.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúJohnny Lance!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù she said, ‚Äúyou
married the prettiest girl and the best liked girl in <Location>Sullivan County</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She jilted a good man to marry you‚Äîand she has roughed it with you, in
this new country, and put up with you, done without things, and met
all sorts of hardships and you would begrudge her the little bit of
pleasure she gets from reading a book when her day‚Äôs work is done and
you want to move on again, thinking always of your own wishes, your
own pleasure, and not of your family.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wonder at you, Johnny!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou got me wrong, Mrs. Mooney,‚Äù he defended, good-naturedly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
begrudge it to her, if it did her any good, but I claim it don‚Äôt.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
reads in a paper that a man stole horses in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> and got away, and
she‚Äôs runnin‚Äô out all the time countin‚Äô ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>Or she reads a story
about a man that left his wife and took up with a younger woman, one
with yalla hair and I see her eyin‚Äô me, and I know she‚Äôs afraid she
might lose me.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs what I mean.</Sentence> <Sentence>My claim is it‚Äôs a mistake to know
more than you need to know; and that‚Äôs why I like animals so well.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They ask no questions, tell nothing, have no ambitions or regrets, or
complaints, and take things as they come.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lance was making motions behind his head, and no more was said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before we left, Mrs. Lance defended her husband‚Äôs wild talk.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúJohnny just talks to hear himself, but he doesn‚Äôt mean it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He feels
bitter about not ever being to school and covers it up by pretending
he does not care.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs a good man to me, Lettie.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt regret giving
Billy Spicer the go-by.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd have had an easier life, maybe, a good
house and near town, but Johnny suits me, for all he‚Äôs rough in his
ways and he likes to talk big.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs a child in some ways, would rather
be scolded than not noticed at all.</Sentence> <Sentence>He just loved having you pitch
into him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt let you go thinking that Johnny is mean, for he
isn‚Äôt.</Sentence> <Sentence>He voted for the school and wants the boys to get an education
as much as I do.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think most men take a little knowing, Lettie.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>They promised to come to see us some summer, when the roads were
better.</Sentence> <Sentence>Distances were long in the early eighties and friendships
languished in the long silences.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The weather broke the day we left the Lances and the real trouble of
the journey began.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fortunately there were many travellers on the road
and the mud-holes were the drag nets which brought them all together.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Sometimes it took three yokes of oxen to draw a wagon out of a bad
spot and even then the long grass beside the road had to be cut and
thrown into the slippery, gummy mud to give the oxen a foothold.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The men wore long boots of leather and overalls of brown or blue duck,
but I do not remember seeing any rubber boots.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the holes were not
deep, Hannah and I were left in the wagon for our small weight would
not make much difference.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it was like a nightmare to see the oxen
go down, down into the mud, sprawling helplessly in its treacherous
depths.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they did not get excited as horses would have and they did
their best, without urging.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the worst part of the road we were
fortunate to have Lord Elphinstone and his traders on the way to <Location>Fort
Edmonton</Location>, and they gave assistance to all the wagons on the road.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
traders who had been travelling the trail for years, were always
serene and cheerful and said the road was not as bad as it used to be,
and that no wagon had been actually lost in the mud for quite awhile.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stopped at another friend‚Äôs house, and made our camp in the yard.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They were Chatsworth people too, who had come the year before.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
had a little girl just my age, named Abigail, a pallid child with
faded hair, who seemed browbeaten and sad.</Sentence> <Sentence>She sat stonily silent in a
little rocking chair hardly moving, and yet her mother and the older
members of the family, often reproved her.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúAbigail behave!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù is all I
can remember of any of the conversation.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and I played the
‚ÄúAbigail behave,‚Äù game many times, adding interesting variations.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
liked to be Abigail, and added to her air of sadness, by letting my
hair fall over my eyes and looking cross-eyed while Hannah shouted at
me to ‚Äúbehave.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Our nice game fell under the ban at last for ‚Äúmocking
is catching,‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople who make faces will find they cannot change
back, if the wind changes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a nightmare one night on the trail, when the whole world roared
around me like a bursting sea.</Sentence> <Sentence>Only it was a sea of mud, black and
greasy, licking me under.</Sentence> <Sentence>All night long, or so it seemed to me, I
fought against it, unable to cry for help, and the next day I was not
able to walk and so was put in the wagon, which lurched and groaned
and writhed over the rough roads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My head ached and I was very miserable.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every jolt of the wagon
increased my pain, although I was packed in between pillows, and
everything that could be done for my comfort had been done.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
quite sure my last hour was approaching, and I was going to be buried
by the trail, like Linda.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had seen a little grave marked by a board
taken from a wagon box, on which the name ‚ÄúLinda,‚Äù was printed in
white chalk on the green paint.</Sentence> <Sentence>A handful of blue fringed gentians,
faded and withered lay on the fresh black earth.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I did not mind dying if it would stop my head from beating‚ÄîI would be
glad to die!</Sentence> <Sentence>The ground would be cold, but it would lie still.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe
they would take me back and lay me beside Linda.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The wagon suddenly stopped and someone picked me up.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe I was
dead.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Now I thought I must be, for I felt no pain.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had only a
great desire to sleep.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBetter let Willie carry her, John,‚Äù I heard mother say, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs quite
a good weight and your shoulder may ache again.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I felt myself being comfortably laid on my father‚Äôs broad shoulder.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHer, is it?</Sentence> <Sentence>A good weight?</Sentence> <Sentence>Poor child!</Sentence> <Sentence>I could carry her to the Tower
of Hook.</Sentence> <Sentence>She‚Äôs just the weight of two dried lamb-skins.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I opened my eyes then, but the light dazzled me and I was too weary to
talk.</Sentence> <Sentence>I drifted down into a deep sea of contentment but vaguely
through my dreams, I thought of Linda under the blue flowers at the
side of the trail.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped she liked her grave and did not mind the
dark, and I was sure God would send an angel for both of us, before
the winter came.</Sentence> <Sentence>If this was dying, it was far nicer than riding in
the wagon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Vaguely through my dreams I could hear my father singing:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúShule, shule, shule, agra
    Its time can only aise me woe
  Since the lad o‚Äô me heart
    From me did part,
  Schedate, avoureen, schlana,
    I‚Äôll dye me petticoat
  I‚Äôll dye it red,
    And through the world
  I‚Äôll beg me bread,
    I wish in me heart
  That I was dead.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I roused at that, and squirmed in sudden fright.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt say that, dad,‚Äù I called down to him.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die,
now!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo more did she!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he laughed.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one does, though it‚Äôs often said.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt say it though,‚Äù I was wide awake now.</Sentence> . . . ‚<Sentence>ÄúDoes
God know we don‚Äôt mean it?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked fearfully.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh, God knows right enough.</Sentence> <Sentence>He hears a lot that He lets go in one ear
and out the other.</Sentence> <Sentence>He knows we all like to rave once in awhile.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I settled down then, relieved and satisfied.</Sentence> <Sentence>God wouldn‚Äôt take a short
turn on me.</Sentence> <Sentence>He wouldn‚Äôt even remember what I said.</Sentence> <Sentence>God was like Lizzie
and good at forgetting.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîCompanions on the Way</Sentence>


<Sentence>At Portage la Prairie we stopped at the Hudson‚Äôs Bay store and bought
further supplies: beans, flour, bacon, salt, nails, duffle, moccasins,
a keg of syrup (Golden Drop), dried apples, soda, pain-killer and
yellow oil.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a big room with a rough lumber floor and blue with
tobacco smoke.</Sentence> <Sentence>A sunburnt trader had come in and was getting toothache
drops.</Sentence> <Sentence>His face was swollen so much one eye was completely shut.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
had come from <Location>Fort Macleod</Location> and he asked us about the roads.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said
the road west was not so bad, now, if the rain would hold up.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indians
in their blankets stood at the door of the store, not saying a word to
anyone, and from their mask-like faces no one could tell their
thoughts.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt they resented the influx of white settlers and the
carts loaded with fur, passing on their way to <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the
buffalo was gone, their best friend, source of food and clothes, so
perhaps the struggle was over, now that the battle was lost.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped
they did not mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>Portage la Prairie had a newspaper at this time
called the _<Location>Marquette</Location> Review_, and there was also a planing mill, from
which lumber was shipped out on the three river boats.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew the
boats quite well, having seen them make their way up and down the
river, when we lived at <Location>Silver Heights</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were the _<Location>Cheyenne</Location>_, the
_<Location>Marquette</Location>_, and the _Manitoban_.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before we left <Location>Silver Heights</Location>, one of the neighbors there, a Mrs.
Armstrong, gave us a little dog, black and white with collie markings,
and on the journey he occupied a wooden keg nailed to the back of the
wagon, and slatted over to keep him in, but with spaces between the
slats to allow him to look out.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a cheerful, friendly little
fellow with puppy-blue eyes and white markings splashed back from his
mouth, giving his face a pansy-like expression.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My joy in having such a pretty little pet, and the brightness of his
face seen through the slatted mouth of the keg, helped me to keep my
copper-toed boots passing each other, as I walked behind the wagon.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The miles grew long and heavy sometimes even to my young feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
little ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù helped me to forget the toils of the journey.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes
too, he ran beside me, guided by a rope from his small leather collar,
for, being a foolish pup, there was always danger of his getting under
the wheels.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day Hannah and I went into the wagon for a ride, and when we came
back, we found the pup was gone.</Sentence> <Sentence>One slat had come unfastened and he
had evidently fallen out.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A desperate situation faced us!</Sentence> <Sentence>The day was threatening rain; great
purple thunder clouds were rolling up from the west, coming right
toward us.</Sentence> <Sentence>The nearest water was four miles away, and the wagons must
be kept moving to reach the water, if possible before the rain came.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Every minute now was precious.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew that.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We took hurried counsel, and decided there was only one thing to do,
and saying nothing to anyone, ran back on the road we had come.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
must find little Watch.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had to find him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Children who have many
treasures may regard them lightly, but our love for the little dog was
a passion.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lightning split the dark clouds and a few big drops fell around us.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Rain would fill the ruts and holes in the road with water, and what
chance could there be then for a fat little pup only three months old?</Sentence>
<Sentence>Hannah watched one side of the road and I the other, and we ran and
called.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were afraid to look back.</Sentence> <Sentence>If we were being called it was better not
to know it!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I do not know how far we ran.</Sentence> <Sentence>The rain poured down in silver rods, and
thunder circled around us, but for once I was not afraid.</Sentence> <Sentence>We prayed as
people do in their sore need, surely God would help us; little Watch
was so little, and so sweet.</Sentence> <Sentence>He couldn‚Äôt be left to die!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly ahead of us, we saw a glint of something white in the tawny
grass beside the road and joy clutched our hearts.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah dashed ahead
and picked him up.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was alive and not even frightened; he had moved
off the road and was sitting up waiting for us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He seemed to know we
would come.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then we both began to cry.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it was not because it was raining and
getting dark, and the wagons were far out of sight.</Sentence> <Sentence>We cared nothing
for any of these things; we had our dog; we were rich again, and our
tears were tears of joy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We began the return journey, running as fast as we could.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>Suddenly behind us came the sound of wheels, and a trader in a light
wagon drawn by bay horses drew up beside us.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhere are you off to, kids?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he questioned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We told him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He helped us into the wagon over the front wheel, and we
sat on the high spring seat beside him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He trotted his team when he
heard the whole story.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll get you back to your folks as soon as we can,‚Äù he said, and his
voice had a strangeness about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had never heard anyone who talked
like him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He gave us a blanket to wrap around us to keep off the rain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We met a man on horse-back who drew up beside the wagon and asked some
questions about a man with a black team.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our friend was sorry, but he
had not seen anybody.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were afraid we were going to be delayed and
were wondering just what sort of a reception we would get when we
rejoined our family.</Sentence> <Sentence>Well!</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, we had the dog.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Soon after we got away from the man on horse-back we saw someone
coming, swinging a lantern, and we were glad to see it was Will.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will
would not blame us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He got in the wagon too and we were soon at the
camp‚ÄîI do not remember any unpleasantness.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night the trader camped beside us, and had supper with us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
a little oiled tent which fitted under his wagon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother asked him to
have breakfast with us, but when we got up he was gone.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some days
after we heard that the <Location>United States</Location> police had sent two men on
horse-back to look for a desperado, who had shot a sheriff in <Location>Montana</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>When last seen he was driving a black team.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Horse teams were rare on the trail and we thought of our trader.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother refused to think evil of him.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHis horses were bay,‚Äù she said,
‚Äúand anyway he was no desperado; he was as nicely mannered a young man
as you will meet anywhere, and besides he was good to the little
girls.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>After we reached home we heard that a settler near Portage la Prairie
had his team changed one night.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had bay horses, and one morning he
found a black team in his pasture.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they were better horses, so he
said he wasn‚Äôt complaining.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We often thought about our friend and hoped he was safe.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER IX‚ÄîThe First Winter</Sentence>


<Sentence>It was a warm clear day with blue shadows toward the end of September
when we left the main road, and turned southeast on the Yellowquill
trail toward the <Location>Assiniboine River</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>The muddy roads with their terrors
were past for we were now traversing a high sandy country with light
vegetation, and raspberry brakes.</Sentence> <Sentence>The blue sky had a few white clouds
that held the colors of the sunset.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hills around were pricked with
little evergreen trees.</Sentence> <Sentence>The oxen sensing the nearness of home, stepped
livelier and everyone‚Äôs spirits rose.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The wagons had to be locked going down the long bank of the river, and
at the bottom we came face to face with the clear, zinc-blue water of
the Assiniboine.</Sentence> <Sentence>Willows hung over the stream, whitening as the wind
turned their leaves, and just above the water, on a dry grassy bank, a
fire was soon burning and the black pot boiling.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had a tin stove
which held two pots, and a bannock was soon cooking in bacon fat, and
the smell of coffee hung pleasantly over the camp.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The river water, clear and soft, gave us all the opportunity of a
bath, and with a change of clothes, peace and contentment came down
upon us with a great feeling of thankfulness.</Sentence> <Sentence>The little black cow
‚ÄúLady,‚Äù who never needed to be hobbled at night, ‚Äúlet down‚Äù her milk
that night as if she knew her long journey was almost over.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In the early dawn we forded the river.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big oxen drawing the
covered wagon, and driven by Will, went first and when we saw them
safely climbing up the opposite bank, it was easy to get the little
oxen to take the water.</Sentence> <Sentence>The pony cart came next and the cow followed.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She had all the intelligence of a good dog and needed no guidance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We crossed just above the junction of the two rivers, the Souris and
Assiniboine, for though the waters are low in September we thought it
best not to risk the added volume of the Souris.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Souris was a
pretty little stream with deep pools connected by an amber current
that twisted around the sand-bars.</Sentence> <Sentence>Both rivers had good hard gravelly
bottoms.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And so the last barrier was passed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I don‚Äôt believe any of us knew what strain this fourteen-day journey
was on my brother Will.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was only twenty years of age, and on him,
the responsibility of bringing us out to this great new unknown
country, had fallen.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have heard him say that when he got the wagons
over the Assiniboine, knowing there were only seven miles more of easy
travelling, a thousand years rolled off him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We reached home at noon of the day we forded the two rivers and found
George all ready for us, with a fine pot of potatoes cooked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No one could fail to be thrilled with the pleasant spot that Will had
found for us.</Sentence> <Sentence>A running stream circled the high ground on which the
log house stood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Away to the south, hazy in the distance, stood the
<Location>Tiger Hills</Location>; to the northwest the high shoulder of the <Location>Brandon Hills</Location>,
dark blue and mysterious, enticed the eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>Near the house there were
clumps of willows on the bank of the creek and poplar bluffs dotted
the prairie north of us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before we were unloaded from the wagons, mother was deciding the place
she would plant the maple seeds she had brought with her from
<Location>Winnipeg</Location>, the hardy <Location>Manitoba</Location> maple.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The log house had a thatched roof, made from prairie hay and was not
chinked, but it had a floor of rough lumber brought to Currie‚Äôs
Landing on a river boat, and one window facing west.</Sentence> <Sentence>One window might
be thought insufficient for a house that must lodge eight people, but
light and air came in unbidden through many openings; indeed how to
keep out the cold became our great problem.</Sentence> <Sentence>We brought a real stove
with us and pipes and the first day saw it set in place and mother
could then begin her bread, real bread, made with a Royal yeast cake,
to displace the soda bannock, cooked in bacon grease, which had been
the backbone of our diet on the journey.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The weather favored us; for a long fair autumn gave us an opportunity
to get ploughing done and a good stable built for the oxen and Lady.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Cattle have been wintered outside in <Location>Manitoba</Location> but my father believed
it was too severe a strain for any animal, and the winter that
followed justified his fear.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the pleasant autumn weather, with blue veils over the hills
and the long clear moonlight nights, with the light shining in through
the unchinked logs, over the bed, where Lizzie, Hannah and I slept.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The stove stood in the middle of the floor, with a long L-shaped
length of pipe running to a tin chimney, with a spark arrester in the
roof.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had home-made bedsteads made of poplar poles and spread with
planks to hold the feather ticks, and with plenty of bedding and
pillows we slept very comfortably.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes the howling of the
prairie wolves drove away sleep and caused me to shudder with fear;
there was something so weird and menacing in their shrill prolonged
cries, which seemed to rise and fall in a rhythm which brought them
nearer and nearer.</Sentence> <Sentence>Just how terrible their wailings could be, we were
destined to know all too soon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I have spoken of the great love we had for our little dog, and the
place that animals fill in the lives of lonely children, but I have
not said enough about ‚ÄúLady,‚Äù the little black cow.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a
graceful, gentle, intelligent little animal, and had supplied us with
milk and butter all summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>On the trip she followed the wagons
without being tied, sometimes stopping for a mouthful of grass by the
roadside and then hurrying on to fall in behind the procession, and at
night when we camped she got her oats when the oxen got theirs; and by
this means she made the long trek of a hundred-and-eighty miles
without losing her fine sleek coat.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was particularly my mother‚Äôs pet and every scrap of food from the
table was saved for Lady, who relished cooked potatoes, crusts of
bread, or a bit of turnip, and was partial to anything that was sweet,
and often for a special treat, was given a slice of bread, soaked in
syrup.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She wandered the prairie at will, though never strayed far, and came
home running if she heard a wolf howl, her fine big cairngorm eyes
wide with fear.</Sentence> <Sentence>Before the stable was built, she spent the night close
beside the house, and often in the stillness I was glad to hear her
regular breathing, close beside me, on the other side of the unchinked
wall.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was in December; Lady was still milking and that precious quart of
milk night and morning was a welcome addition to the porridge
breakfasts.</Sentence> <Sentence>The stable had been built, a three-sided building whose
sod roof was covered with prairie hay, two stacks of which stood on
the north to give more shelter and in this, the four oxen were tied
every night and Lady went in and out as she liked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The hay stacks were fenced with poplar poles to keep out the oxen for
it was thought wise to save the hay for the time when the deep snow
would prevent them from getting at the prairie grass.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The thirteenth of December came and with it dark tragedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will who had
gone out first, brought in the bitter word.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lady was dead!</Sentence> <Sentence>She had
caught her horns in the fence and in trying to extricate herself had
fallen and broken her neck.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were eating breakfast when Will came in, and I was pouring milk
from a glass pitcher on my porridge when the black blow fell.</Sentence> <Sentence>We cried
out that it could not be, and hurried to the place of horror!</Sentence> <Sentence>There
she lay, cold and stiff with horribly staring eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>No warm place
under her now to warm bare feet; no gentle regular breathing.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
my first sight of death and it shattered something in me that could
never be replaced, a sense of security maybe.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I knew that there
was always a grim possibility, a shadow that can fall on the brightest
day.</Sentence> <Sentence>A sinister presence unseen, but none the less real.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Years afterwards, the Rev.</Sentence> <Sentence>Isaac Newton Robinson, a Methodist minister
held revival meetings in Northfield school and during one of his
appeals quoted the words, new to me then,</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúO sinner think
  Of the feeble link
  Between you and the grave.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew what it was.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lady alive, breathing, warm beloved Lady with her
soft brown eyes and sweet breath, who came to us when we called her
and followed us like a dog; and then the ghastly misshapen bulk, cold
and stiff with blind glassy eyes, that made no response, no motion.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The ground, iron hard with frost, could not be dug to bury her.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the
men drew her away behind a poplar grove and we all cried again, as we
watched that melancholy procession moving over the snow, the little
dog marching behind barking.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And the nights that followed were terrible when the wolves fought and
cursed and cried over her and we had to hear them, and see them too,
for it was clear moonlight and they seemed to come from the four
corners of the world, snarling, snapping, hungry ghouls, grey, lean
and terrible.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was on one of these nights that we saw for the first time the
<Location>Northern Lights</Location> in all their majesty and awesome beauty, and it was
not only in the north that they flickered and flashed, and rolled and
marched, for their bright banners ran up into the highest parts of the
sky right over our heads.</Sentence> <Sentence>If we had not been in such trouble over the
death of Lady, we would have loved all this color and movement, but
there did not seem to be any kindness in the sky in spite of the pale
green and rose and lilac streamers fluttering and dancing like long
lines of fairies‚Äô petticoats hung out to dry on a windy day.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I tried to think that what I saw was really great companies of little
angels out having a game of ‚ÄúCrack the Whip,‚Äù all dressed in their
lovely dresses, bright and shiny, and that the crumpling sound I heard
was the rustling and cracking of the silk as they swung together, but
I could not get far with any thought as pleasant as that, with poor
Lady lying out under the moon and the wolves fighting over her.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Long after the last bone of Lady was gone, the wolves still came back
on the moonlight nights hoping that some other evil thing had befallen
us, and their cries were so horrible that I had to sleep with my head
under the pillow instead of on it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother wrote her friend, Mrs. Edward Lowery:‚Äî‚ÄúOur first Christmas was
not very happy because we lost our nice little black cow.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I
can‚Äôt tell you how I miss her.</Sentence> . . . . <Sentence>She had winsome ways, coming to
the door and shoving it in with her nose if it wasn‚Äôt latched, or
rubbing the latch up and down, reminding me it was milking time.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
great hopes of Lady!</Sentence> <Sentence>She was going to establish a herd for us, all
having her gentle disposition, but that‚Äôs past!</Sentence> <Sentence>You know I do not cry
easily but that morning I did.</Sentence> <Sentence>Just for a minute, and when I saw I was
breaking up my whole family, I had to stop, though I would have been
the better of a good cry to ease my heart, but when a woman has
children, she has no freedom, not even the freedom to cry.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLady was more than a cow to us.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a pleasant companion.</Sentence> <Sentence>Poor
Will felt it terribly.</Sentence> <Sentence>He always knows what I feel better than any of
the others, and he kept saying: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt cry, mother, I can‚Äôt bear to
see you cry!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô Just as soon as the snow is gone, I‚Äôll go to the Portage
and get two cows‚Äîhe will too, poor lad, tramping every step there and
back.</Sentence> <Sentence>But there can never be a cow like Lady‚Äî.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôre all well now, the
little girls had sore heels; blood out of order, no doubt, not enough
variety in their food, but salt and water healed them in time.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
snow was six feet deep on the level, but Willie has snowshoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>He and
George got out.</Sentence> <Sentence>We have come through well so far, and will have a
garden this summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs a great comfort in a garden.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs
heartsome to see things grow.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are neighbors coming too, a family
from Renfrew.</Sentence> <Sentence>That is good news!</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI get worried sometimes about my own health and wondering what would
happen to the little girls, if I should be taken.</Sentence> <Sentence>Boys can always get
along but it‚Äôs a hard world for girls; sometimes I blame myself for
coming away so far.</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs no doctor closer than Portage, which is
eighty miles away.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can‚Äôt say this to anyone but you, I don‚Äôt blame
Willie; he is a good boy, if there ever was one.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs at night, when
every one is asleep and this great prairie rolls over, so big and
empty, and cruel.</Sentence> <Sentence>John is as happy as a king, never thinks of anything
beyond today, so long as he has a place to grow potatoes!</Sentence> <Sentence>He has a
field now for his pigs‚ÄîI never can like pigs, dirty squealing brutes,
never satisfied, but we‚Äôll be glad of the meat next winter, and will
have some to sell too, if there is anyone to buy them.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMuch love to all of you.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôll see you again some day, God willing.</Sentence>
<Sentence>John sends his love too, we speak of you often and all the dear
friends.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But the trials of that long first winter were not ended.</Sentence> <Sentence>In March the
snow fell continually, it seemed, and with the wind shrieking over the
plains, packing the snow in drifts as high as houses, we were entirely
shut in.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was in this time of isolation that my eldest sister took
sick, with a heavy cold, that in spite of turpentine and goose oil and
mustard foot-baths, went steadily on through chills and fevers, until
it seemed that she would die.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had reached a state of coma, her
jaws were locked, and her eyes though still open, did not see.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
lay, with her two long braids of bright brown hair, beside her little
white face, a tired young traveller, ready to drop out of the race.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My mother, who was a wonderful nurse, had tried every remedy she had,
but there was not one flicker of response.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and I were doing
what we could to get meals ready, but on this worst day of the storm,
no one wanted to eat.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was like a horrible dream.</Sentence> <Sentence>The storm tore
past the house, and fine snow sifted through the walls.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother came out from behind the quilts which hung around Lizzie‚Äôs bed,
and sitting down in the rocking-chair buried her face in her hands.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôm beaten, John,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI can‚Äôt save her!</Sentence> <Sentence>I am at the end of my
resources!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Her shoulders shook with sobs and it seemed like the end of
everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one spoke.</Sentence> <Sentence>Behind the quilts, that labored breathing
went on, hoarser and heavier.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMy little girl is dying for want of a doctor, in this cursed
place‚Äîthat never should have been taken from the Indians.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe Indians have their revenge on me now, for it‚Äôs tearing my heart
out, to see my little girl die before my eyes.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>We shouldn‚Äôt have
come John, so far‚Äîso cruelly far‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs money?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîWhat‚Äôs land?</Sentence> <Sentence>What
comfort can we have when we remember this‚Äîdying for want of a skilled
hand‚Äîthe best child I ever had.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her willing little feet and clever
hands will soon be as cold as iron.</Sentence> <Sentence>The fluid is rising in her lungs,
and I can‚Äôt stop it, only a doctor could drain it off and give her a
chance.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My father tried to comfort her.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôve done all anyone could do,
Lettie; don‚Äôt give up, you always said you wouldn‚Äôt give anyone up
while they were breathing.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre tired woman dear, tired and
discouraged, but maybe she‚Äôs right at the turn now, who knows?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt stand any more‚ÄîI got my coat and cap and mittens and
slipped out.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could get to the stable and stay in with the oxen for
awhile.</Sentence> <Sentence>The house had grown horrible to me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I got out I waited in the shelter of the house for a lull in the
storm; the cold struck my face like a lash and seemed to sink its
teeth in me‚Äîbut it gave me a savage relief too.</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt care if it
did strike me!</Sentence> <Sentence>I would face it!</Sentence> <Sentence>I would take its blows!</Sentence> <Sentence>I made my way
against it to the stable and stood watching the turmoil of snow; there
was no earth and sky now, just one great rolling confusion that
cleared for a moment, then thickened and rolled and screamed past.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
couldn‚Äôt think of anything only that Lizzie was going to die, and we
couldn‚Äôt do without her!</Sentence>

<Sentence>In the lull of the storm, I could see perhaps a hundred yards across
the creek, and over the drifts I saw a man approaching.</Sentence> <Sentence>My heart
turned over with joy, and I ran back to the house, bursting with the
news.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Someone was coming on snowshoes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He came in hastily shutting the door quickly behind him to keep out
the storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>A big man in a fur coat; one cheek was frozen but he had a
handful of snow to rub it out.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI heard you had a sick girl,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I have some medicine in
my bag.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am the Methodist minister who has just come to Millford.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
name is Hall‚ÄîThomas Hall.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou are as welcome as an angel of God,‚Äù mother said solemnly, as she
rose to meet him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>From the moment he entered the feeling of the house changed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I saw the
fear vanish from mother‚Äôs face.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was herself in a moment, taking
his coat and cap, setting a chair for him beside the stove, and
putting on the tea kettle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the chill was gone from his clothing he went to see Lizzie and
felt her pulse.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe has a good strong heart and I believe we can pull
her through; she has youth on her side and God always helps,‚Äù he said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could have knelt at his feet and worshipped him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>For three days he stayed with us, taking charge of the case like a
doctor and when he left, Lizzie was able to speak and could drink beef
tea.</Sentence> <Sentence>She made a complete recovery in the next few weeks.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER X‚ÄîSpring Came at Last Bringing Neighbors</Sentence>


<Sentence>When the spring came, Will walked to Portage la Prairie‚Äîeighty miles
and brought back two red cows, and from these our herd grew.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were
just cows; that gave milk and ate grass, chewed their cuds and
switched off flies; and in season bore their young, wabbly little
sprawlers, but they could not take Lady‚Äôs place.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Perhaps, in fairness to the two cows, I should say they were over
shadowed by another factor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will brought home a cat at the same time,
a black and white cat, named Philip, a gift from Mrs. Sutcliffe, who
had a stopping house on the <Location>Portage Plains</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Philip was a full-grown cat, bearing on his portly person, evidence of
hardship and struggle, tips of ears were gone, and a crook in his tail
gave him a swagger in his walk.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he would purr, when greatly
pleased; and he walked abroad in search of gophers.</Sentence> <Sentence>The little dog
Watch, who had not seen a cat in his lifetime, let one loud and
distressful yelp when he saw Philip and the battle was on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah and I undertook to allay the ancient grudge between our two
pets, trying to reason with them and bring them together amicably.</Sentence> <Sentence>On
the dog‚Äôs part, there was a desire for reconciliation even after he
had been clawed and bitten, but Philip‚Äôs only medium of communication
with little Watch, continued to be a spit with elevation of back fur!</Sentence>
<Sentence>He remained a mean-tempered arrogant old rascal, as long as he lived.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But he was furry and soft and would purr, and we bestowed on him a
large measure of unrequited affection.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The house, which was to receive a family from Renfrew, stood about
three miles from our house, and all that first long winter, it served
as an emblem of hope to us, across the snow.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a square frame
house, built by Mr. Naismith and his brother-in-law, Tom Dunfield, who
had returned to their home in Renfrew for the winter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day we saw wagons arriving and great excitement prevailed.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had
neighbors!</Sentence> <Sentence>It wouldn‚Äôt be long until we had a school, life had begun.</Sentence>
<Sentence>While we speculated and talked and wondered, mother set a batch of
bread and took me with her and went over to meet the strangers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Naismith had the loveliest straw-colored hair done in braids
around her head, and when she made a cup of tea, she served it in
cream china cups with rosebuds.</Sentence> <Sentence>The family were all boys except one
little girl, the baby, a very pretty little thing with big blue eyes
like her mother, and the same wealth of golden hair.</Sentence> <Sentence>The boys were shy
and would not play with me, but Minnie let me sit beside her in a big
black rocking chair, which had a log cabin back and cushions, and my
heart overflowed with joy to know there were children so near.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I
know my mother was never so lonely again.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Naismith, next to my
own mother, will always typify the pioneer woman to me, calm,
cheerful, self-reliant, and undaunted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In 1882 we built our house; logs had been brought for two winters from
the bush, squared and made ready and there came a great day when the
neighbors gathered, men and women and the house went up, with great
good will.</Sentence> <Sentence>The men gave their help freely bringing their own axes, and
planes, and saws; and it was an occasion of excitement and pleasure.</Sentence>
<Sentence>In <Location>Ontario</Location>, ‚Äúbarn raisin‚Äôs,‚Äù were often accompanied by liquor
drinking, and sometimes accidents and fights occurred as a result, but
there was nothing of this, at ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother was strong in her belief
that liquor was one of the devil‚Äôs devices for confounding mankind;
and anyway there was no liquor in the country at that time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But there was a long table set in the shadow of the old house; where
roast chicken, potatoes, turnips, custard pie, currant buns and big
pots of tea, cheered the workers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the ‚Äúraisin‚Äô,‚Äù not only because it was a great event, as a
new house must always be, but because it was on this day that we were
given one of the good gifts of my childhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. and Mrs. Naismith,
brought us a pup, a lovely black and white pup, half <Location>Newfoundland</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
knew that their dog had pups, we had seen them, but we had not even
hoped to get one, for we had one dog, and pups were so precious and in
such great demand, they were not casually asked for.</Sentence> <Sentence>But was this
little fellow welcomed?</Sentence> <Sentence>I spent the day of the raising carrying him in
a basket, so afraid I was that in the excitement someone might step on
him; we called him ‚ÄúNap,‚Äù and he grew to be a beautiful dog, the best
loved of any dog I ever owned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The house was a great joy to us, a clean new lumber-scented house,
with a big room downstairs, a bedroom for father and mother, a real
stairs, and two bedrooms above, and a large kitchen with two windows
and a pantry.</Sentence> <Sentence>It still stands, bent a little by the heaviness of
years, but its beams have held and the corners still split the winds.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It is a tool house and workshop now on my brother‚Äôs farm, but to me it
is a storehouse of happy memories.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first summer, flower beds were made in front of the house, round
beds, in which mignonette, portulaca and balsams were planted.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
beds were edged with buffalo bones, from the piles which lay along the
creek.</Sentence> <Sentence>The buffalo had been gone only a year when we arrived and the
bone piles indicated the places where Indians had held their feasts.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Arrow-heads of bone, and occasional broken bows with thongs of rawhide
rewarded our search.</Sentence> <Sentence>Most magnificent were the beaten paths leading to
the water holes, still called ‚Äúbuffalo runs‚Äù where the hoof marks were
almost as clear as the day they were made.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was sad to think of the buffalo, and how they had been killed, so
wastefully, by the hunters from American cities, and yet, the buffalo
had to go if the country were to be opened up for settlers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some of
the people believed the Indians had destroyed the buffalo, killing
them, and using only their tongues for food, but that was not true.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The Indians could not possibly have exterminated such great herds.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
American hunters had done it, selling the hides in <Location>Minneapolis</Location>, and
the meat too.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt they considered them their own buffalo, even if
they had come to <Location>Canada</Location> looking for better feeding grounds.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The last buffalo had been seen the year before we arrived, but I held
to the hope that I might some day come over the top of a knoll and see
the dark brown, curly breasted, heavily set animals, with their great
shoulders and small hindquarters, feeding on some grassy meadow.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Indians still had bags of pemmican, after 1880, which is buffalo
meat sun dried, and beaten to a pulp and mixed with berries, probably
saskatoon, or cranberries, and pressed into bags; it was a black, hard
mass, with bits of hide and hair in it, for the squaws who made the
pemmican were not always particular.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still pemmican was hearty fare,
and on the prairie in the cold winter, not to be despised.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The buffalo was a fat animal, and in the roasting of their meat, there
must have been great supplies of fat, which the Indians allowed to
burn in the fires.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother‚Äôs frugal Scotch heart was grieved when
she thought of this waste, and she often wondered why the Indians did
not use some of the fat to grease the wooden wheels of their carts,
and so prolong their usefulness, and end the weird groanings and
dismal creakings of the protesting axles.</Sentence> <Sentence>But maybe the creakings and
whinings were liked by the red men, and made the music of the trail
for them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In 1884 there was an effort made to gather up the bones for
fertilizer, and five dollars a ton was paid for them in <Location>Regina</Location>,
<Location>Saskatchewan</Location>.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XI‚ÄîThe Hen-house Door</Sentence>


<Sentence>Our flock of hens, little and big, numbered twenty-six in the fall of
1882, and they were comfortably housed in a tidy little log hen-house
with a pitched roof made from wide rough boards.</Sentence> <Sentence>One window let in
light and air, and the door, fastened with a wooden button, had to be
closed each night to prevent marauding mink or weasels from entering.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Living beside a creek has its disadvantages, for these blood-thirsty
little animals that lived in the clay banks, menaced the lives of our
hens.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One night in December the blow fell!</Sentence> <Sentence>For by some subterranean passage
weasels had made an entrance to the hen-house, and in the morning the
twenty-six hens lay dead on the floor, each with her throat slit.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
weasels had gone the way they came leaving our poultry project in
ruins.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a severe loss, but we recovered from it, by the kindly help of
our neighbors the next spring.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think Mrs. Naismith organized the
chicken shower which established once more our feathered industry.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One lovely June day, when the prairie was at its best with buttercups,
and wild peas, the neighbors came from the four corners of the
compass, our four neighbors, each with a box in the wagon and in each
box was a hen and chickens, and strangely enough, each hen bore a
resemblance to the kind donor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Naismith‚Äôs hen was a fine golden
yellow one with black markings.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. William Johnston‚Äôs sturdily built
<Location>Plymouth</Location> rock, iron gray and placid.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Ingram‚Äôs a graceful little
white hen, and Mrs. Burnett‚Äôs a coal black with shining eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
called them: <Location>Nancy</Location>, Mary, Georgina and Annie, after their owners, or
rather, we tried to apportion to them these names, but mother
suppressed the suggestion.</Sentence> <Sentence>She said the names of respectable married
women were not to be lightly bandied about a farmyard.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A plank floor was put in the hen-house and other precautions were
taken against mink and weasel, so our flocks grew steadily after that.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The next year we had a pond made for ducks and they grew and
multiplied.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Shutting the hen-house door became one of my chores.</Sentence> <Sentence>At sundown it
must be closed for every decent hen goes in as soon as the shades of
evening fall.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we later added a few turkeys my cares increased.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Turkeys know nothing and care nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Death has no terrors for them.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Rain kills them when they are young so they walk out in it every
chance they get, piping their melancholy little notes; and so far as
lies in them, they resist rescue.</Sentence> <Sentence>I always felt it was a low trick to
set a hen on turkey eggs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Of all fowl, hens are easily the most intelligent.</Sentence> <Sentence>There is a core of
real good hard sense in every hen, and in addition to this, some of
them are distinct personalities.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The yellow hen given us by Mrs. Naismith had the misfortune to freeze
her feet one winter.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a born rover and once had to spend the
night out and it was a cold night too.</Sentence> <Sentence>We found her on the sheltered
side of the hen-house in the morning, with her feathers fluffed out
and her temper equally ruffled.</Sentence> <Sentence>She blamed everyone but herself for
what had happened.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We brought her in, applied coal-oiled rags to the frosted toes and
gave her a bran mash with pepper in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She recovered from her hard
experience but the ends of her claws were too badly damaged and poor
<Location>Nancy</Location> found she could no longer scratch.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next spring, she became a problem for she wanted to hatch.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was
shut up in a box; she was tethered by a cord, to one of the little
maple trees; she had fluffy skirts put on her legs, which take up the
attention of some hens and make them forget their maternal urge.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
<Location>Nancy</Location> could not be distracted.</Sentence> <Sentence>She demanded her rightful place in the
community.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why should she be deprived of the joys of family life,
because she had lost a few toes?</Sentence> <Sentence>She kept up her agitation, until
mother gave in and let her have six eggs, and peace reigned for
twenty-one days.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then Nancy stepped off her nest with six chickens and led them
straight to the kitchen door and noisily applied for relief.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt scratch up any seeds for them, of course, but we had to
let her think she was doing it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Many times a day someone had to take
bread, soaked in milk, or boiled wheat out to <Location>Nancy</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>If not, <Location>Nancy</Location>
walked in at the kitchen door with her six trailers and raised a
disturbance.</Sentence> <Sentence>The only way to keep her out was to supply plenty of
provender.</Sentence> <Sentence>All the other hens were afraid of her, and she had full
right of way at the water pans.</Sentence> <Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt fight with her maimed
claws, but I have no doubt she had a retentive memory and a scurrilous
tongue.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We all liked her, so no one minded giving her a hand with the
chickens.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when they were feathered out, she began to steal
chickens from the other hens, just to show the world, that she was as
good as the best.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one knew how she did it, or what inducements she
offered, but she increased her flock to ten and before the season was
over had adopted two lumbering young turkeys whose real mother had
tired of them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a sight to see her sitting over her brood at night, with the
vacuous faces of the young turkeys sticking out through her feathers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt hold herself on the roost, so we made her a box with a
little bar across, just high enough to lift her slightly off the
floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>She managed to stay on this by leaning against the back and
side of the box, and was comfortable, I think.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was never quite
reconciled to the low seat, when all the other hens had gone up to
roost and sometimes flew up and tried to balance herself on the roost,
but she couldn‚Äôt manage it, with her poor little stumps of claws.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The hen-house door was a profound influence in my childhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Once I
forgot it and wakened in the dark middle of the night with a sickening
sense of guilt!</Sentence> <Sentence>The weasel might have come!</Sentence> <Sentence>Or a mink!</Sentence> <Sentence>Every last hen
became suddenly dear to me, a thousand times more precious then ever
before‚Äînow that I had betrayed them!</Sentence> <Sentence>And <Location>Nancy</Location>, poor <Location>Nancy</Location>, sitting on
the floor, she would be the first to feel the weasel‚Äôs tooth!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I got out of bed and carrying my boots in my hand crept down the
stairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>The slightest sound would waken mother so I went as softly as
a weasel too, but the steps in the stairs squeaked and my knees
cracked like pistols.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I got out, closing the door like a thief, and crossed the yard;
the night was as dark as the inside of a cow, not a star even, and
quiet as a tomb.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a cold night too in the fall, but I was so
frightened I felt nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the hens were all dead, I might as well
die too, like the Roman generals who ran on their swords when they
lost the battle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew I was near the door and was feeling for it with both hands when
suddenly I stumbled over something warm and furry.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Nap,
precious Nap, the dog, who ordinarily slept in the straw stack.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was
guarding the door.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîGood old Nap!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîHe was trying to cover up my misdeed.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I went in to see if everything was safe and felt on the roosts.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Sleeping hens stirred drowsily as I ran my hand over their hard little
feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>Evidently all was well.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap had saved them‚Äîand me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt for
Nancy on the floor, and got a reassuring peck from her, sweet as a
hand shake.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I made my way back to the house so relieved I could have danced for
joy, but I could feel the cold now, piercing through my factory cotton
night dress.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Responsibility is no doubt good for a child, for one has to learn
sooner or later to take it.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hen-house door was my first big
assignment and certainly left its mark on me.</Sentence> <Sentence>For years after I grew
up and was away from the scenes of my childhood, I would waken from
sleep in a panic of fright.</Sentence> <Sentence>Had I closed the hen-house door?</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XII‚ÄîSocial Activities</Sentence>


<Sentence>Five miles north east from our farm, at Millford, on the Souris river
where it was joined by <Location>Oak Creek</Location>, there was a flour mill owned by
Major Rodgers, who had brought with him a colony of young men from
Peterboro, Coburg and Port Hope in 1880.</Sentence> <Sentence>The boarding house was run by
Mr. and Mrs. George Motherwell and Mrs. Motherwell‚Äôs sister, Maria
Somers; and the store was owned by John Brown, late of Owen Sound.</Sentence>
<Sentence>William Turnbull, a Scotchman, had a blacksmith shop, and John
Wheeler, an Irishman, had a cobbler‚Äôs shop.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The mail came from Brandon, for in 1882 the Canadian <Location>Pacific</Location> Railway
was extended that far, and at least once a week, usually on Saturday,
the mail man reached Millford, with his welcome bags.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a
thirty-mile drive so arrival in the winter was naturally uncertain and
the subject of many wagers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Would he come at all?</Sentence> <Sentence>Would he come
Friday?</Sentence> <Sentence>Or Saturday?</Sentence> <Sentence>Before noon?</Sentence> <Sentence>Or afternoon?</Sentence> <Sentence>The petty cash of the
boarding house changed hands each week, according to the mail man‚Äôs
arrival.</Sentence> <Sentence>One sour old fellow, a true pessimist, put up his twenty-five
cents each week against all takers that the mail man would not get
through at all and twice during the winter of 1882 raked in all the
stakes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were dances in the boarding house in the winter evenings, when
the two long board tables could be shoved back to the walls and the
bracket lamps turned up as high as they would go without smoking.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
brother Will and George went to the first one, but mother sternly held
out against Elizabeth‚Äôs going.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was only fifteen years old and much
better in her bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when Will put in a plea for his young sister,
and Lizzie had just made for herself a beautiful wine-colored cashmere
dress with a cream lace collar and cuffs, (material sent by Aunt
Ellen) mother began to weaken.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know now how she felt but then, none
of us could see any reason for her reluctance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lizzie went and no doubt made a sensation.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a pretty little
girl, very slight and graceful, with two great braids of glossy brown
hair, bright brown eyes, fair skin and high color, a sweet voice and
ringing laugh which set the dimples in her cheeks.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and I were
bursting with pride when Will and George and Lizzie set out, all in
their best clothes and their shoes done with lampblack and tallow.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They drove the oxen, in a sleigh and were well covered with blankets
and robes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After that the weekly dances became a feature of our lives, and though
Hannah and I were years removed from any such exciting pleasures, we
planned ball-dresses, and selected jewels, for ourselves, with a fine
prodigality, and wore them, according to our own testimonies with
devastating effect.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every eye in the room was on us we said, when we
entered the ballroom, and mothers of marriageable daughters turned
pale with envy when they saw our dazzling beauty.</Sentence> <Sentence>What chance had
their pallid daughters now to gain the hand of Lord Ronald, and Lord
Elphinstone?</Sentence> <Sentence>We gossiped too, unmercifully, about our rivals, and
disposed of their matrimonial chances, in stinging words.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lady Mary
Manners was a ‚Äúchit‚Äù from school.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Duchess of Trent dyed her hair,
and the Countess of Whiffords‚Äô two daughters, though stiff with
jewels, could never grace a baronial mansion, for one had an evil
temper, and the other one was bow-legged.</Sentence>

<Sentence>With the opposition thus well out of the way, the Mooney sisters were
ready to concede their own election.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Each night after we had
gone to bed, we carried along the story through endless episodes.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The pup given us on the day the house was raised grew into a fine big
dog, and when he was a year old, I had him well broken as a sleigh
dog.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each Saturday in the winter, I made the journey to Millford for
supplies for the week, and the mail.</Sentence> <Sentence>The _Family Herald_ from <Location>Montreal</Location>
brought the world to our door.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew that the boundary of <Location>Manitoba</Location>
had been changed and enlarged, but that made but little difference to
us.</Sentence> <Sentence>A lot of good that would do us!</Sentence> <Sentence>A million acres of jack pine and
jack rabbits added to our territory!</Sentence> <Sentence>But any news of railway extension
kindled our hopes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bitter denunciation of the Canadian <Location>Pacific</Location>
Railway‚Äôs insistence on its monopoly was on every tongue, when it was
known that American companies were willing to come, but the Government
at <Location>Ottawa</Location> had promised the Canadian Pacific Railway Company they would
have no rivals for twenty years.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one blamed the Premier of
<Location>Manitoba</Location>, honest John Norquay, who, Conservative though he was, was
fighting his political friends at <Location>Ottawa</Location>, on behalf of the people of
his province, who far from the one line of railway, were finding it
hard to market their crops.</Sentence> <Sentence>The matter of interprovincial
transportation rightly belonged to the Government at <Location>Ottawa</Location>, under the
provisions of the <Location>North America</Location> Act; but teamsters on the long trails,
cold and tired, were not disposed to consider fine points of law.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
wanted a shorter haul to market.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My father, who was a staunch Conservative, became the apologist for
<Location>Ottawa</Location> and the Canadian <Location>Pacific</Location> Railway.</Sentence> <Sentence>He pointed out the expense
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had incurred in building a coast
to coast line; and what about it, if they did get all the odd number
sections for twenty miles on each side of the railway, and a
twenty-year monopoly.</Sentence> <Sentence>What use was raw land anyway?</Sentence> <Sentence>And if American
companies were allowed in they would soon own us, lock and barrel.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Government saw this danger and wanted to keep us British.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Later when the Canadian <Location>Pacific</Location> Railway‚Äôs branch line was built from
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> to <Location>Glenboro</Location> sixteen miles straight east of us, my father said
that was near enough.</Sentence> <Sentence>Who would want a railway any nearer?</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúSure, you
can go and come in a day,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand what more do you want?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But the younger members of the family were not satisfied so easily,
and annexation with the <Location>United States</Location>, as a solution of the deadlock
over the delay in railway construction, became the topic of
conversation around the nail kegs and sugar barrels in John Brown‚Äôs
store in Millford, or any place where the neighbors gathered.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The great event of our first three years was the building of the
school‚Äîtwo miles from our farm, a government school, for the upkeep of
which a tax was placed on each acre of land, and ten dollars a month
was given as a grant from the Provincial Government.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would be ten
years old that fall and I was deeply sensitive about my age and my
ignorance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah, who had been to school in <Location>Ontario</Location> and could read
newspapers or anything, was willing to teach me, but I would not be
taught.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was going to be a cowboy anyway, so why should I bother with
an education?</Sentence> <Sentence>I could count to a hundred and I would never own more
than a hundred head; all of which was a bit of pretense on my part, a
form of self-protection.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>One of the neighbors, lately come from <Location>England</Location>, had a boy my age who
could read.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not only could, but did.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even brought his books over when
his family came to visit my family and read.</Sentence> <Sentence>He stood in the middle of
the floor and intoned like a curate, page after page from some dull
book all about plum-cakes at a school-treat, and my mother took the
occasion to deplore my state of ignorance.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúJust listen to Frankie!</Sentence>
<Sentence>And he is no older than you are.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now don‚Äôt you wish you had let Hannah
teach you‚Äîa big girl ten years old, who will not learn anything.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My heart was hot for revenge and it came, when Frankie came out to
play with me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Frankie ran crying to his mother when I landed my first blow on his
neat little features and when he sobbed out the story of his injury, I
reached new low levels in the social scale.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one could defend my
action; even Lizzie admitted it was a pretty low thing I had done‚Äîto
actually strike a visitor, but when it was all over and I had been
made to apologize, I was still glad that I had done it, it gave me
such a glorious sense of relief.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lord it over me‚Äîwould he?</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Philip, the old black and white cat, had a rival, a sweet little
silvery grey kitten with white paws and breast brought by Will and
George one day when they came home from the Moggey farm on <Location>Oak Creek</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The Moggey family had lately come from Owen Sound.</Sentence> <Sentence>We called it
Sylvia, after the heroine of a story that was running serially in the
_Family Herald_, and she was the prettiest little thing we had ever
seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah wrote a poem to her:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúHail Sylvia, sweet and frail
    Snowy breast and arching tail,
  Whither cometh thee to bless
    One poor family‚Äôs loneliness,
  Princess in a feline dress?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She slept on a pink quilt which covered our bed, and when she lay a
lovely ball of silver fur, in the centre of that quilt Hannah and I
often went to feast our eyes on her loveliness.</Sentence> <Sentence>But again came
tragedy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Old Philip, tired of hearing this young interloper praised and sung,
killed her one evening.</Sentence> <Sentence>He grabbed her when she was drinking from her
saucer and shook her.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was all over, before anyone could speak.</Sentence> <Sentence>One
shake and the tiny neck was broken and grief broke over us in an
overwhelming flood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Having accomplished his evil purpose, Philip fled
and was not seen for days.</Sentence>

<Sentence>For weeks afterwards, I believed she would come back.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt make
myself understand that death is permanent; surely with all the cats in
heaven, God would send a good trusty angel down with Sylvia for us,
when we loved her so much.</Sentence> <Sentence>I often tiptoed with my eyes shut into the
room where our bed stood with my heart beating like a hammer,
expecting, hoping, praying that the soft ball of gray fur would be
curled up on the quilt.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>We buried her on the sunny slope that ran down to the creek, under a
silver willow, whose shiny gray leaves brought back the glorious sheen
of our little friend‚Äôs coat.</Sentence> <Sentence>We sharpened a shingle and drove it in at
her head, with a small stake at the foot, marked S and on the shingle
Hannah wrote, with a carpenter‚Äôs pencil:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúHere lies dear little Sylvia Moggey,
    A thing that died oh far too young,
  From a bite from Philip Sutcliffe
    Philip bit her on the tongue.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He didn‚Äôt exactly bite her on the tongue, he shook her roughly, but we
couldn‚Äôt put that in a rhyme; we had tried hard to tell the exact
truth, even sought help in this honest endeavor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Try it, if you think
it is easy!</Sentence> <Sentence>But what did it matter?</Sentence> <Sentence>She was dead.</Sentence>

<Sentence>To the sunny southern slope, where the wind turned over the silver
leaves with a gentle sound that broke my heart afresh for it made me
think of Sylvia‚Äôs gentle purring, I often went to lay a flower on her
grave.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah pointed out that it was strange how often I was overcome with
this desire just when the dishes were ready to be washed.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had high
words over this, and in the end I set up a grave for myself and wrote
my own verse or at least composed it, for I couldn‚Äôt write:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúFour dear dogs‚Äîthey died alone,
    Nobody saw them, or heard them groan,
  There they died by the drifts of snow
    While the wind rocked their tails to and fro.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah did the writing for me but under protest.</Sentence> <Sentence>She knew I never had
four dogs and so naturally had not lost them; that I had created them
merely to cut them off in their prime, and she said a person shouldn‚Äôt
lie, even in a epitaph, but in that contention, I found out afterwards
that she was in a hopeless minority.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîThe Church and the School</Sentence>


<Sentence>In the summer of 1882 the church at Millford was built by volunteer
labor, though the expense of the material was met by the Missionary
Society of the Methodist Church of Canada.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rev.</Sentence> <Sentence>Thomas Hall, the good
angel who came out of the snow storm to us, the March before, had the
full qualifications for a Missionary, for he could do anything.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Under his guidance the church was ready for occupation in the fall of
the year, when a great Harvest Home Festival opened the church
activities of the Millford district, and every resource of the
neighborhood was brought to the success of that event.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Naismith
did not even withhold her rose-bud china.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On a bright September afternoon when every person within a circle of
ten miles came, and the field around the church was black with wagons,
ox teams and a few horses, the church was dedicated to the ‚Äúservices
of God and humanity.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first couple married in the church were Roman Catholics and Mr.
Hall used the sign of the Cross at their request in the ceremony,
which led to some criticism, but my father defended Mr. Hall and said
as Christian people we should never forget that the cross was the
sacred symbol of our faith.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMany a time,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhen I was on the
<Location>Ottawa</Location> and our raft was nearing the rapids I crossed myself with the
Catholic lads on the raft.</Sentence> <Sentence>It helped me to remember that God was with
us even in the high water.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first funeral in the church was that of the minister‚Äôs little boy,
his only son, Wilbur, a handsome little lad of three with bright
golden curls; who died in the spring of ‚Äô82 when the wild anenomes
were spreading their blue carpet over the prairie.</Sentence> <Sentence>We made a blanket
of them to cover the plain lumber coffin, by opening a new gunny sack
and sticking the stems of the flowers through the open mesh.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
church was full of their sweetness, that hot spring morning as we sat
and listened to the solemn words of the burial service, and when the
little coffin was lowered into the grave on the hillside and the clods
of earth fell on it, it was with a softly muted sound.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A Sunday school was started in the little church at Millford and a Mr.
Calverly became the superintendent.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Hall had three preaching
places and so could not be at the Sunday School.</Sentence> <Sentence>We drove to church
which was held in the evening, but it was a long walk to get to Sunday
school in the afternoon, a five mile journey each way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Great excitement prevailed when Northfield School was finished.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
heard that the teacher was a man, who had taken a homestead at Pelican
Lake and had been teaching near <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, and the school would open
one Monday morning.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a new pair of boots and dark gray hand
knitted stockings and a homespun dress, some of my mother‚Äôs own
weaving, which Lizzie had made up for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>White lace was frilled in at
the neck to keep the flannel from scratching me and, as my hair was
shingled, I needed no hair ribbon.</Sentence> <Sentence>The dress was gray and red in small
checks.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wished I could have some ‚Äúboughten,‚Äù material for my dress,
I was sure I would be the only girl at school with a homespun dress
and, I was.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think mother had been somewhat hurt with us because we
all preferred ‚Äúboughten‚Äù goods.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was in vain she told us of how long
the homespun would wear.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I can‚Äôt remember why Hannah did not go that first palpitating day.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Bert Ingram called for me and we set off in the gloom of an October
snow storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Ingrams who came from Woodstock, <Location>Ontario</Location>, were our
nearest neighbors, living one mile west of us on section eighteen.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Bert had been to school in Woodstock, and was a real man of the world
in my eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had a tailored suit of gray tweeds, knee pants, a tweed
coat with pockets and a leather belt and a skull cap.</Sentence> <Sentence>He carried a pea
shooter, too, and said if the teacher gave him any lip he would sock
him in the eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bert was two years older than I, and reading and
writing and number work held no terrors for him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We hesitated for a minute at the fire-guard,‚Äîthe one improvement made
on the school property‚Äîsix furrows of plowing to check a possible
prairie-fire.</Sentence> <Sentence>School was in; heads showed at the two windows.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
question of whether we should walk in, or knock held us up.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
settled for us, by the teacher rapping on the window in a way that
suggested speed, and we went in.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The teacher sat behind a desk of unpainted wood; and when he said good
morning he smiled at us, and asked us our names.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bert told him, his
and mine too.</Sentence> <Sentence>By this time, I did not know mine.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He told us we could sit together, until he got the classes arranged.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
was too shy to look around at the strange children, but I was
surprised to know how many children there were.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered where they
had all come from.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were fifteen or sixteen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In front of us sat Annie Adams, dressed in a lovely navy blue cashmere
dress, with red piping and brass buttons, and she had two long brown
braids with a red ribbon braided in them, and a bow on the nape of her
neck and one on the end of each braid.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not only that, but had a
circular comb in her hair and a red one at that.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt naked and
ashamed with my round shingled head, destitute of ribbons, or any
place to put a ribbon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Annie had every piece of equipment, a provident
child could think of.</Sentence> <Sentence>The frame of her slate was covered with red felt
and her slate rag, a piece of white cotton had a herring-boned hem and
a heavy glass salt cellar, filled with water indicated a source of
moisture.</Sentence> <Sentence>She even had a pen-wiper.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The teacher was finding out what we knew, and looking at the books we
brought.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he called me to come up to his desk bringing my books, I
had nothing to bring, but a battered old ‚ÄúSecond-part‚Äù <Location>Ontario</Location> Reader
and a slate with nothing on its frame.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could tell of no school
experiences at all, ‚ÄúI cannot read,‚Äù I confessed miserably.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He smiled at me again, and said, ‚ÄúNever mind that, you‚Äôll soon learn.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am nearly ten,‚Äù I said, determined to tell all.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúGood!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he said, ‚Äúa very good time to begin school; you‚Äôll be reading
in three months.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I looked at him then and the compact was sealed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew I would be reading in three months.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew my burden of ignorance
was going to be lifted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I went back to my seat, I did not care how many bows or combs
Annie Adams had.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not mind my homespun dress.</Sentence> <Sentence>Something had
happened and a new world had opened before me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Another door had
opened!</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I went home all I knew about the teacher was that his eyes were
gray with green pebbles in them, and that he wore a lovely brown
knitted coat, (we did not use the word sweater) and that he had said I
would soon be reading.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The following spring we had our first Inspector, Dr. Franklin of
Portage la Prairie, and he came without warning, just a knock at the
door and he was in, a fine looking tall man, with a brown mustache and
side whiskers, and a black frock coat which impressed us deeply.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
not seen one before.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dr. Franklin had started a Young Ladies‚Äô Seminary
but when the direful effects of the real estate boom of 1881-‚Äô82 began
to be felt, the young ladies were forced to return to their homes, and
the seminary languished.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dr. Franklin then accepted the position of
Government Inspector of Public Schools.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember him with gratitude.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was in the Second Reader then, and
able to read.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were reading for him the lesson called ‚ÄúThe Faithful
Dog,‚Äù and when my turn came the story was approaching its
heart-breaking climax, where the traveller, having shot his dog
thinking he had gone mad, rides on and then suddenly remembers the
saddle bags left behind in his haste, and gallops back to find them
safe with the dog, who had crawled back leaving blood drops all the
way, and now lies beside them, dead.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I mired down before I got that far and could not either see or speak.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It was an awkward moment, and some one in the class laughed, and my
humiliation was complete.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dr. Franklin reached over and took the book
from me, and said ‚ÄúVery well read little girl!</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs really too sad a
story for a school-reader,‚Äù‚Äîthen to Mr. Schultz, ‚ÄúHere is a pupil who
has both feeling and imagination, she will get a lot out of life.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>And at that I cried harder than ever.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Soon after Northfield School was built there came a new settler to our
district, a Mr. Frank Kinley who took up a homestead just east of Mr.
Naismith‚Äôs.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was from Prince Edward County in <Location>Ontario</Location> and had been a
church worker all his life.</Sentence> <Sentence>He canvassed the neighborhood to see the
state of our spiritual life and found that only a very few of the
children went to Millford Sunday School regularly and he suggested
that we start a Sunday school in our own school house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The people welcomed the idea and money was subscribed for papers and
soon the opening day came.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Schultz, the teacher, gave his hearty
support and under his direction the school house was tidied up,
woodpile straightened and everything made ready.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I don‚Äôt know how it was arranged for the school room was very small;
but there were four classes organized.</Sentence> <Sentence>My sister Lizzie had the little
girls.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Ingram the bigger girls, and Mr. Naismith and Mr. Kinley
the two classes of boys.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Ingram played a little organ, sent, I
believe from a Sunday school in <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Kinley had sent for the
Sunday school lesson helps and each of us was given a Quarterly with a
red and white cover.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hymns appropriate to the lesson were given in
these and the music, so we learned the lessons in prose and verse.</Sentence> <Sentence>In
the day school each morning we read first the lesson and then the
daily readings.</Sentence> <Sentence>So when Sunday came we were rooted and grounded in the
scripture for that day and the Bible stories flamed into reality with
us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rehoboam and Jeroboam walked with us as we crossed the prairie
with our dinner pails and we had long discussions on what would have
happened if better counsel had come at the call of the young king.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
could see how jealousy ate up Saul and the story of his throwing the
spear at David was so well dramatized one day at noon that Billy Day
nearly lost an eye.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz gave us composition exercises and memory work from the
Scripture lessons too, and the Bible became to us a living book
overflowing with human interest.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Schultz went home each Friday
night, fifteen miles south to Pelican Lake, but his support of the
Sunday school was a great factor in its success.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Kinley was a tall thin man, with light blue kindly eyes and a
hesitating way of speech.</Sentence> <Sentence>His wife, a faded little woman, was an
invalid and had not walked for years.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each Sunday, he carried her into
the school room, wrapped in a fur coat, even in the hottest weather
and deposited her in a rocking chair, kept there for her use.</Sentence> <Sentence>From her
veils and mufflers her sweet little withered face looked out at us
with a little hopeful bitter-sweet smile, which often made me want to
cry.</Sentence> <Sentence>It must be terrible to be helpless!</Sentence> <Sentence>But Mr. Kinley‚Äôs honest face
beamed with love, when he spoke of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was the guiding star of
his life, he said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Sometimes, when he reviewed the lesson at the close of the Sunday
school session, in his painstaking way, the school grew restless.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
had very little sentiment and he had an irritating way of saying the
same thing over and over, and usually before the school was dismissed
the order was lost.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day, I heard two of the teachers discussing the situation with
him.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI often wonder if the children are getting anything out of the
lessons,‚Äù Mrs. Ingram said, ‚ÄúWe try so hard and yet they seem so
inattentive.</Sentence> <Sentence>I watched my class today and not one was listening, they
were looking out the window, fumbling their books, pinching each
other, whispering.</Sentence> <Sentence>I declare, I am about ready to quit.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh no!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Mr. Kinley said earnestly, ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt quit, I don‚Äôt believe
they are as inattentive as they seem.</Sentence> <Sentence>They may forget what we say now,
but they will remember it in years to come.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Anyway, we owe them
a duty, no matter how they receive our teaching, we owe it to them,
we, whose hearts have been touched with grace, we must not eat our
bread alone.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was about eleven when I heard this, and it opened another door for
me, that gave me a glimpse of a heavenly country here on earth.</Sentence> <Sentence>If ‚Äúno
one ate their bread alone,‚Äù we could have a glorious and radiant world
here and now, a bright and happy world!</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be joy and
gladness and singing in it, with plenty of work for everyone, but it
would all be happy work; there would be no bad tempers, or tattlings,
or scoldings, or ox beating, or ugliness.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I saw it in a flash,
in a radiant beam that shone around me in that moment, and I
experienced a warming of the heart that has never altogether faded
even in my darkest hours.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That week I told the other children as we sat in the shade of the
wood-pile playing ‚Äúknife,‚Äù what I had heard, and how I felt about it,
and we agreed that we would give Mr. Kinley a surprise and this would
probably please him more than the mustache cup we were saving up to
give him for a Christmas present.</Sentence> <Sentence>We would listen when he reviewed the
lesson and we wouldn‚Äôt stir, not so much as lift a finger, and he
could talk as long as he liked.</Sentence> <Sentence>The first Sunday, we sat like graven
images, every eye on him, and all went well, only Bennie Rothwell,
began to laugh.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had been afraid of Bennie, but Joe, his brother
clapped a handkerchief over Bennie‚Äôs nose and rushed him out, and Mr.
Kinley in his larger charity thought it was a nose bleed.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XIV‚ÄîPicnics</Sentence>


<Sentence>The spring of 1882 is remembered by all Manitobans, for two reasons:
the great floods that turned the peaceful rivers and streams into
raging torrents of water; and the great real estate boom that
convulsed the city of <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The flood concerned us closely, for even our own shallow Spring Brook
swollen by the spring thaws, and rains, ran from bank to bank and had
to be crossed on a raft.</Sentence> <Sentence>The <Location>Souris River</Location> at the junction of <Location>Oak
Creek</Location>, where the little village of <Location>Millford</Location> stood, had widened into an
inland lake which filled all the lower level of the valley.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cellars
were full and there was grave danger of complete inundation.</Sentence> <Sentence>As it
was, there was no way of getting down to the store and post office,
but by the use of a boat.</Sentence> <Sentence>The valley had three levels and Millford
stood on the second with a high bank at the south running up to the
plain above.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Major Rodgers‚Äô boats were used to cross the flood, and there were
plenty of idle men in Millford to man them, for the flood had risen
above the level of the mill, thereby stopping its operations and
carrying away its warehouse.</Sentence> <Sentence>The mailman still made his visits from
Brandon, though irregularly, because of the high water.</Sentence> <Sentence>When anyone
appeared on the high banks of the river a boat was dispatched from the
store to see what was wanted, and the boats from <Location>Winnipeg</Location> still
brought supplies to Currie‚Äôs Landing.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one suffered for food.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the flooded creek below our house with great delight, and
all the excitement of seeing the home-made raft pushed out in the
whirling current when George and Will, with long poles worked their
cumbersome craft over to the other side, losing much ground in the
crossing, so that they landed some distance down stream.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, that
did not matter.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they had to pull the raft up on the opposite bank,
making due allowance for a rise in the water line, since the creek
rose each night with the melting of the snow.</Sentence> <Sentence>Having crossed the creek
at home, they walked the five miles to Millford, where a still greater
flood had to be crossed, but the rowboats made this an easier
accomplishment; I would have liked to go with them, but I knew that
was a vain hope.</Sentence> <Sentence>However it was exciting enough to watch for their
return, and to be the first to see them a mile away on the
snow-patched prairie, with their grain bags on their backs.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
sorry when the current of water in the creek fell to its normal size,
but no doubt the older people were relieved.</Sentence>

<Sentence>While we were concerned with the floods, the real estate boom in
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> which had begun the fall before, gathered momentum with the
coming of spring.</Sentence> <Sentence>Weird tales of the excitement drifted out to us.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
knew that American, and <Location>Eastern Canadian</Location> speculators had flocked into
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> and that money was flowing like the swollen waters of the Red
and Assiniboine.</Sentence> <Sentence>People were sending money to these men to buy them
lots, and the whole population had caught the fever.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lots sold and
resold, without having been seen or surveyed.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a strange and
hectic time, when even sensible people were caught up in the whirlwind
of speculation.</Sentence> <Sentence>We heard of real estate offices opened in livery
stables; money kept in tin pails and baskets, weighed down with
horseshoes; and people making a hundred dollars a day selling lots
that they had never seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew we had made a mistake in not buying
<Location>Louis</Location> Prudens‚Äô farm.</Sentence> <Sentence>We could have sold it all for building lots, and
become wealthy, beyond a doubt.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother refused to believe that
fortunes were being made so easily, but we believed it, my sister
Hannah and I. Consequently, we spent many happy times, after we had
gone to bed, dressing ourselves in silk attire, and outfitting riding
horses in brocaded velvet saddles and jewelled bridles, and doing
ourselves very well in the matter of riding-habits.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a yellow
plume on my black velvet hat that swept the horse‚Äôs withers, but
Hannah corrected me on that, by telling me that I would be facing the
wrong way on my horse, if the plume reached the withers; she said
‚Äúrump,‚Äù was the word I should use, but I stuck to withers.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúRump,‚Äù was
a horrible word, applied only to cattle and had nothing to do with a
well-curried horse turned out to carry a lady.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would sacrifice the
plume rather than use it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>About the middle of the summer the boom broke, and the investors
awakened out of their dream.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a hard blow to the young country.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Every one seemed to have lost money.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Eastern speculators went
back, angry and disillusioned, blaming the country for their losses.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There is no doubt that this spectacular boom, and its complete
collapse, marked the beginning of the ill feeling between the East and
the West.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We suffered from it, too, in finding that the machine companies had
pushed up their prices, and that immigration had suddenly ceased.</Sentence>
<Sentence>However, we still had a ready market for all our surplus crop; wheat,
hay, potatoes, but we were resentful of the fact, that the West,
through no fault of its own, had been given a black eye!</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Our first community effort was the holding of a picnic, on the first
of July that year.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think Frank Burnett was the originator of the
idea.</Sentence> <Sentence>Frank Burnett had been a stockbroker in <Location>Montreal</Location> in 1879, but
having read Butler‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Great Lone Land,‚Äù he began to think of
making the venture of coming West.</Sentence> <Sentence>This intention was strengthened by
listening to a lecture by Thomas White, of the <Location>Montreal</Location> _Gazette_,
(afterwards Sir Thomas White) who had made the trip in 1878, and
written many articles on it for his paper.</Sentence> <Sentence>So in the same year that we
came West, 1880, Frank Burnett, his wife Henrietta, and their two
small children, Nina and Frank junior, made the journey.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have heard
them tell the story of their arrival in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, in March of that
year, with a capital of eight-hundred dollars and a great optimism,
born of inexperience.</Sentence> <Sentence>They bought an outfit, and started for Prince
Albert.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a wild undertaking, for Prince Albert was at least six
hundred miles distant, and with the outfit they had, they could never
have made so long a journey.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fortunately when they reached <Location>Pine Creek</Location>, which was about thirty miles
from the junction of the Souris and the Assiniboine rivers, they heard
that my brother Will, and his friend Macdonald, had lived that winter
in a tent at the Junction getting out logs for a house, and that they
had taken land in a fertile valley.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Burnett resolved to go and see
this country.</Sentence> <Sentence>Leaving his family at <Location>Pine Creek</Location>, he pushed on with his
pony cart.</Sentence> <Sentence>When at last he arrived, and saw the country he decided to
go no farther.</Sentence> <Sentence>Here was deep, black loam, excellent drainage, three
running streams, the <Location>Souris River</Location>, <Location>Oak Creek</Location>, and a little creek we
afterwards called Spring Brook.</Sentence> <Sentence>The <Location>Tiger Hills</Location> formed the southern
boundary of this fertile area, which was thickly studded with timber
for firewood, and there was the additional advantage to Mr. Burnett of
being able to buy logs for a house from Will and his friend.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first summer Frank Burnett, and his two brothers who had come from
<Location>England</Location>, built a double log house, partitioned by a log wall in the
middle, and in it the five adults (James Burnett had brought his
family) and the six children lived for two years.</Sentence> <Sentence>The women had had no
pioneering experience, and it must have taken all their resources of
courage, and fortitude to endure that first terrible winter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Burnett house was about a mile and a half south west of ours, and
like ours was built on the bank of Spring Brook.</Sentence> <Sentence>Farther south on the
creek in 1881, William Johnston and his wife built a house, and later
Robert Park came and put up a house, and went to Portage la Prairie in
the winter of 1882 and brought back a wife.</Sentence> <Sentence>Settlement went on apace
after 1882, and soon we had, much to our delight a real neighborhood.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The settlers were at first all <Location>Ontario</Location> people, except the Burnetts.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Bob and Charlie Johnston, two young Englishmen came in 1883, and took
up a section two miles straight west of our farm naming their place
‚ÄúClonskey,‚Äù and by that name it is still known.</Sentence> <Sentence>C. Gardiner Johnston,
(Charlie) was for many years a well known shipbroker in <Location>Vancouver</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Frank Burnett, who was a natural leader, began to talk of a picnic
early in the summer of ‚Äô82, and he thought we should hold it at
Millford, beside the river.</Sentence> <Sentence>There could be tables set in the shade of
the poplar trees, seats constructed and a clearing made, which would
make a permanent picnic ground.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A committee was formed and a program of sports arranged.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was to
be a baseball game, married men versus single men; a pony race, an ox
race, a slow ox race, and foot races.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was hoping there would be a
race for girls under ten, or that girls might enter with the boys.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
the whole question of girls competing in races was frowned on.</Sentence> <Sentence>Skirts
would fly upward and legs would show!</Sentence> <Sentence>And it was not nice for little
girls, or big ones either, to show their legs.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to know why,
but I was hushed up.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still, I kept on practising and tried hard to
keep my skirts down as I ran.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could see it was a hard thing to do.</Sentence>
<Sentence>In fact, I could see my dress which was well below my knees, was an
impediment, and when I took it off I could run more easily.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
suggested that I would wear only my drawers, (we did not know the word
bloomers) I had two new pairs, held firmly on my ‚Äúwaist,‚Äù with four
reliable buttons.</Sentence> <Sentence>My suggestion was not well received.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I wanted a
pair of drawers made like my dress; for that would look better than
white ones with lace.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie thought this a good idea, but mother
could not be moved.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a stone wall here that baffled me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why
shouldn‚Äôt I run with the boys?</Sentence> <Sentence>Why was it wrong for girls‚Äô legs to be
seen?</Sentence> <Sentence>I was given to understand that this was a subject which must not
be spoken of.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was very concerned about food for the day.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt I wish I
could make half a dozen good juicy pies!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing a
man likes as well as a pie, but with no fruit, no eggs, no pumpkins,
its hard.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still I am going to think out something.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Well, one
good thing anyway, is, there will be no whiskey drinking to spoil
everyone‚Äôs fun.</Sentence> <Sentence>We won‚Äôt have that trouble for a while for there‚Äôs no
whiskey in the country and if everyone felt as I do, there never would
be any.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve seen too many nice times spoiled with it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Drunken men
fighting and swearing in the street, and their women crying and trying
to separate them.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was awful sometimes in Chatsworth, no fun for
anyone, just bad times.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The picnic day was the loveliest sort of a day; bright and warm, yet
cooled by a gentle wind, and the prairie on July the first with its
sweet brier roses in massed bloom was a sight to remember.</Sentence> <Sentence>The buds
were deep crimson and the blossoms graded in color from that to pure
white, according to their age.</Sentence> <Sentence>Orange lilies were just beginning their
season, and being scarce were much prized by the young hunters.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
strawberries had been killed with the frost in June, and having no
fruit had sent forth a great crop of leaves.</Sentence> <Sentence>Saskatoon berries were
reddening on their branches but would not be ready for a couple of
weeks yet, though their unripe state did not keep us from trying to
eat them; but their tastelessness dulled our enthusiasm.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Down by the river the tables were set, and benches from the boarding
house brought down for seats.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were raisin-buns and cinnamon
rolls, curled like snail shells, doughnuts, and cookies, (ginger and
molasses) railroad cake; lettuce cut up in sour cream, mustard and
sugar, cold sliced ham, home cured, and mother had made half a dozen
vinegar pies, using her own recipe.</Sentence> <Sentence>The filling of a pie is rather a
delicate matter when you have no fresh fruit, or eggs, but she made
her filling of molasses and butter, thickened with bread crumbs, and
sharpened and flavored with vinegar and cinnamon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her one regret was
that she had not the white of an egg to make a frosting, but we had no
hens that year.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The great surprise of the day was the box of oranges that came from
<Location>Rapid City</Location>, and a great bunch of bananas just as it came off the tree,
held up before us by John Brown, the storekeeper.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were not
enough to give one to each person, but we all had a piece, and what a
disappointment that first taste of a banana was!</Sentence> <Sentence>It tasted like white
flannel to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>But there were people there who enjoyed them, and that
made me wonder.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bob Naismith did not like his bit either, but Mr.
Burnett told us bananas were an acquired taste, and explained what
that was: ‚ÄúOne grew to like them,‚Äù he said, whereupon Bob and I, with
this encouragement made another assault on the saskatoon berries.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But in the barrel of supplies from Brandon was a wooden pail of
chocolates, bell-shaped, black grocery chocolates, thinly coated with
this new delicious substance, and filled with white cream candy, which
was soft, but not sticky.</Sentence> <Sentence>Two of these were our portion and having
eaten one, and found it to be like something one would dream of, but
never taste, I tried to keep my second one to help me to meet some of
life‚Äôs vicissitudes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I might be crossed in love, as the years rolled
on, or lose my character, or my money, and I knew this piece of magic,
held tightly in my hand would comfort me, for one moment at least,
though all the world went wrong.</Sentence> <Sentence>But looking at my treasure I
discovered it was melting and spreading and oozing out between my
fingers.</Sentence> <Sentence>So, to save it I had to eat it.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I made it last as long as
I could; and licked my fingers so hard I almost took the skin off
them, in pursuit of the last drop of this unbelievable sweetness.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The seats from off the wagons were set around the place where the
baseball game was played.</Sentence> <Sentence>The ball was a home-made yarn ball, and the
bat a barrel stave sharpened at one end, but it was a lovely game, and
every one got runs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were enough provisions for supper.</Sentence> <Sentence>So we stayed on and ate
again, and were sorry to see the sun going down in the west.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
would be chores to do, cows to milk, and pigs to feed when we got
home, but no one cared.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was so good to get together.</Sentence> <Sentence>I believe my
special joy in the day was to see my mother so happy.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had on her
brown poplin dress, and because of the bright sun, wore a wide straw
hat instead of her bonnet.</Sentence> <Sentence>Under the trees, at the table, she took off
her hat, and her pretty brown hair curling over her ears made her look
as young as any of the women.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was so good to see her talking and
laughing, and making light of the hardships of the long winter.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
suppose she was the oldest woman at the picnic, though she was not yet
fifty, but a new country belongs not to age but to youth, and mother
seemed to advise all the younger women, and become a mother to all of
them in their family cares.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At the supper, the men began to tell why they came to the Northwest,
(Easterners still called it that) and in almost every case, it was to
get land for their boys.</Sentence> <Sentence>One woman spoke up and said, she wanted to
come because she and her husband had too many relatives in Paisley,
and they couldn‚Äôt buy a fanning mill, or a neckyoke, or a black pot,
without the relatives knowing, and they would be sure to get a ‚Äúdig‚Äù
about it from some of them, and she dare not buy herself a hat, even
though it was with the butter and egg money, for some of Jimmy‚Äôs
relatives would say that Jimmy would die in the poorhouse, because of
her extravagance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Everyone laughed, and there was more fun about relatives and their
inquisitiveness.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I remember one man said he hoped coppers would
never come into use in <Location>Manitoba</Location>, for they had been a curse in <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mr. Hall, the minister then spoke up and he hoped they wouldn‚Äôt
either; they were hard on the churches, but they served one good
purpose, they made it possible for Scotch people to be generous.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew my mother wouldn‚Äôt like that, but she laughed with the others.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Coming home as we did at last, in the purple prairie twilight, we were
very tired and happy, with the pleasant evening sounds around us,
drowsy birds softly twittering, the distant rumble of wagons, dogs
barking, cattle lowing, the western sky still barred with crimson, and
bright edged clouds above us; we were sure that no neighborhood had
ever had a happier picnic.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe have good neighbors, John,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúfriendly, jolly people.</Sentence>
<Sentence>What a blessing!</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought I‚Äôd never find neighbors like the Lowerys,
the Congers, the Charltons, and the Littles and the Blacks and
Carsons, and Kingsburys, and Hemstocks; but these will be just as good
to live with‚Äîand its just as Mr. Hall said, picnics give us a chance
to get acquainted.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It did my heart good to see Frank Burnett and
George Motherwell bite into the vinegar pie.</Sentence> <Sentence>In another year we‚Äôll
have hens and I‚Äôll make some lemon pies that will melt in their
mouths.</Sentence> <Sentence>Step up the oxen, George, the sun is down, and ‚Äôtwill be
nearly dark before we are home, and the cows will be at the bars,
wondering where everyone is.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then the conversation turned to Mrs. Dack, the woman who came west
because of her numerous relatives.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother thought it was a queer way
for her to talk of her relatives, and maybe she was extravagant, too,
certainly her hat with its plumes looked very dressy.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Anyway it
would have been better for her to let Mr. Dack do the talking, when
there were so many strange men present.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt see why, but I knew enough not to say so.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next year, 1883, we had a picnic in the same place, and we had a
horse race that year; for the settlers had added horses to their
equipment.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our boys wanted to run Kate, the smarter one of the team we
had just bought, but mother was against it.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúA work horse isn‚Äôt cut
out for racing,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand you have no saddle to ride her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Just
let her stay where she is, I never saw any good come of horse-racing,
anyway.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù There was a brass band from Brandon that year, and ever so
many more people, <Location>Oak Creek</Location> people and some from <Location>Brandon Hills</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Frank Burnett‚Äôs sister had come from <Location>Montreal</Location> and her city
clothes and colored parasol gave a real impetus to dress styles among
us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her picnic dress was of factory cotton, trimmed with knife
pleating, and her hat, a red straw turban.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was tall and graceful,
and looked like a picture in Godey‚Äôs Lady Book.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Having experienced how lovely a picnic can be, we came to this one,
with great expectations.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some of the print (white ground with blue and
yellow dots) brought from Chatsworth, was made into dresses for Hannah
and me by Lizzie‚Äôs skilful hands; I can see them yet, and smell their
pleasant starchy smell.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were made with a tight ‚Äúbody‚Äù buttoned
down to the waist behind, and a full skirt.</Sentence> <Sentence>The plainness of the
‚Äúbody‚Äù was relieved by a graduated frill which ran over the shoulders,
wide at the top and tapering to nothing at the waist, and referred to
as ‚Äúwings.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The band from Brandon, with their great brass instruments, drove into
the picnic grounds in their big democrat, with red rosettes on their
horses‚Äô collars, and when they alighted, coming swiftly down over the
wheels, we were pleased to see how young they were.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was just a
boys‚Äô Band that had come to play for us.</Sentence> <Sentence><Location>Nice</Location>, fair-faced hungry boys,
who came over to the tables declaring they had been thinking of this
meal all the way from Brandon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>They played: ‚ÄúRule Britannia,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Maple Leaf,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod Save the
Queen,‚Äù in a perfect torrent that shook the ground.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had never heard
a brass band before and it affected me powerfully.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seemed to change
everything while its billows passed over me.</Sentence> <Sentence>The bandsmen went up the
hill to the ballground, where the races were to be held, and we ran
after them determined not to miss a sight or sound of these young
magicians.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the distribution of oranges, bananas and chocolates
did not alter the focus of my mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>Though I did eat my banana, a
whole one this time, the taste had not yet come.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The women were having their visit down at the tables.</Sentence> <Sentence>The baseball
game went over noisily, and the horse race was not nice to watch for
one horse was ridden by a real jockey in a red cap, and he beat his
horse from one end of the half mile to the other, with a short
black-snake whip, and I was glad he did not win.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In the slow ox race, our black and white Jake was entered, and I was
glad no one would beat him; for one rule of that race was there would
be no whips or switches.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each man would ride his neighbor‚Äôs ox, and
endeavor by words or entreaty or hand slaps to get the ox to move as
fast as possible.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some one could run behind the ox and push him or
slap him, and some one could go ahead with a pan of oats to coax him.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The slowest ox would win the race, and the prize was a box of raisins
from Read &amp; Callendar‚Äôs store; and as our Jake had won the race the
year before, we were hoping he might again.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jake was a placid little
ox, very gentle and knowing.</Sentence> <Sentence>He could push open a door with his nose,
and although he was never seen hooking any animals in the farm yard,
he was recognized as the boss of them all.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was oddly marked with a
black back and white sides, the black part making almost a perfect
blanket.</Sentence> <Sentence>His face was white with two black eyes, giving him a rakish
look.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had been washed for the occasion and was received with
applause when he was led out to the road where the race would take
place.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy Sloan, who worked for one of the neighbors would ride
Jake.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Just then the women came up the hill, Mrs. Dale wheeling her baby in
the carriage.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had been watching the baseball game, but I ran over
to Mrs. Dale‚Äôs carriage to see if I could wheel the baby.</Sentence> <Sentence>Being the
youngest of my family I had never had the care of a baby, so it was a
treat to me to wheel a carriage.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Dale gladly relinquished the
baby, and I kept the carriage moving as I watched the slow ox race
forming at the far end of the field.</Sentence> <Sentence>Little Jake took his place with
the other four oxen.</Sentence> <Sentence>And the word was given!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The race began, and the fun was on.</Sentence> <Sentence>In spite of entreaties Jake kept
his pace.</Sentence> <Sentence>He merely shook his ears, but refused to quicken his steps.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The people cheered and shouted, and three of the oxen began to trot,
Jimmy Sloan waved his straw hat, from side to side, ki-yi-ing like a
coyote to frighten his mount.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly, I saw Jake dart forward with a bellow of pain‚Äîhe began to
gallop like a wild thing, and threw his rider in his frantic
lurchings.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was coming straight for the end of the field, still
bellowing‚ÄîA horrified silence fell on the people.</Sentence> <Sentence>What did it mean?</Sentence>
<Sentence>Had he gone crazy?</Sentence> <Sentence>He was making straight for the shelter of the
trees, where I stood with the baby carriage.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>My heart turned
cold with terror!</Sentence> <Sentence>Some one was screaming!</Sentence> <Sentence>He changed his course a few
feet from me, and crashed into the brush!</Sentence> <Sentence>As he passed I saw that his
white side ran with blood!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The picnic broke into an uproar.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy Sloan had used spurs!</Sentence> <Sentence>The race
was spoiled‚ÄîAll the fun had gone out of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then the truth came out.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Jimmy Sloan had been drinking.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would never have done this if he had
been himself; there wasn‚Äôt a better boy in the country than Jimmy
Sloan.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt walk; my knees had gone weak, and my memory of the picnic
is confused from that point.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know Mrs. Dale came running and her
face was white and sick looking.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was great indignation, high
voices and excitement.</Sentence> <Sentence>Who had brought liquor to our picnic?</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was to be a dance that night in the boarding house, and the Band
was supplying the music.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie and George and Will were going to
stay, but I think only Will stayed.</Sentence> <Sentence>The whole temper of the day was
spoiled.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy Sloan was not hurt when he fell.</Sentence> <Sentence>I heard some one say
something about a drunk man‚Äôs luck.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the picnic had gone raw and
sour, and broke up in disorder, suspicions and accusations.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night behind the boarding house there was a ‚Äústand up and drag
out fight,‚Äù between the Canadians and the English, for the Band boys
had brought a supply of liquor from Brandon, and every old grudge,
under its influence came to the surface.</Sentence> <Sentence>One man had traded off a
spavined horse to an Englishman, who had believed the horse to be
sound.</Sentence> <Sentence>Another Englishman had jumped a Canadian‚Äôs claim, when the
owner had gone to <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every old grievance became suddenly
inflamed, and there were heads smashed, noses broken, and at least one
chewed ear.</Sentence> <Sentence>There might have been more serious happenings but for the
intervention of Frank Burnett.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had no picnic the next year.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was my first direct contact with the liquor business and coming
so early in life, it left a mark.</Sentence> <Sentence>The maddened ox, blind with pain,
coming bellowing toward me and the baby asleep in her carriage‚Äîthat
was my nightmare for many years and still holds an allegory which has
not lost its meaning as the years go by.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know there is a pleasant
aspect of this matter of drinking, and when many people think of it
they see the sun-kissed vinyards, where the grapes hang purple and
luscious, and the happy people sing glorious songs of praise, for the
wine that cheers their labors, and warms their veins.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some think of
how it loosens the tongue and drives out self-consciousness, and makes
for good fellowship when people meet.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think of none of these things.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I remember a good day spoiled; peaceful neighbors suddenly growing
quarrelsome, and feel again a helpless blinding fear, and see blood
dyeing the side of a dumb beast.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XV‚ÄîThe Way of the Transgressor</Sentence>


<Sentence>The prairie summers were delightful.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The cool, dewy mornings with a sunshine clear as cellophane;
languorous afternoons with heat waves quivering the skyline, every
blade of grain and grass growing and every bird singing; clamorous
evenings with the cows coming home and the teams coming in from the
fields, waggons rumbling and dogs barking, dishes clattering; light of
day dulling down into the long purple twilight, and the short swift
night so soon streaked with dawn.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The prairie was never stingy with its flowers, from the furry-nosed
blue anemones that pushed the snow aside in early April to the wealth
of golden rod and purple sage, and blue fringed gentians that
embroidered the headlands in the fall.</Sentence> <Sentence>Between these, bloomed
buttercups, marsh marigolds, trilliums, wild vetches, wild roses,
tiger lilies, lady‚Äôs slippers‚Äîyellow as June butter and sweet as
honey, and if you knew where to look for them you could find the
purple blooms of great size and of orchid-like beauty.</Sentence> <Sentence>In some places
these were sold at the stations to the travellers on the trains.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The peak of the year came in harvest time when the ripening grain made
golden squares and bands on the prairie, and blue haze shrouded the
horizons, and the dewy nights distilled all the fragrances of the
field.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loved to listen to the sibilant whispering of the ripening
grain billowing and dappling in the wind, and to watch the dark blue
flowing shadows cast by drifting clouds.</Sentence> <Sentence>From the time the grain began
to turn to gold in early August until the stooks polka-dotted the
fields, the whole countryside throbbed with color and movement and
sound.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a great pride in my heart, when I saw the cultivation of our
farm increasing year by year.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had taken fields of grass and turned
them into fields of grain.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had brought the seed and soil together.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had walked proudly behind my father, in the clean new furrows in my
bare feet, as he broke the new sod on our farm, and as the coulter cut
the sod, and the share turned it over, I knew he was doing something
more than just plowing a field.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew there was a significance in
what he was doing, though I had no words to express it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew this
was what the land had been waiting for all these long years.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
for this that the rain had fallen on it in summer and the snows had
covered it in winter.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was for this the grass had grown on it,
withered, and grown again, that some day someone would come and claim
it, not for himself alone but for all people, claim it in the name of
humanity and press it into humanity‚Äôs service, stamping and sealing it
forever with the broad signature of the plow.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But there was a shadow on my happiness too.</Sentence> <Sentence>From the time the grain
was high enough to be eaten by the cattle, someone had to keep them
out of the fields for we had no fences at this time.</Sentence> <Sentence>Before the school
started, I was very glad to be the herder.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was much nicer to sit
outside with good young Nap beside me, than stay around the house,
where there was always dishes coming up to be washed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when I
started to school and got a taste of learning, and swept through the
Second Part and the Second Book and arrived in the Third Book, and was
able to stand by Annie Adams in her blue cashmere dress and brass
buttons, her hair ribbons and covered slate frame, all in the first
year, how was I going to survive, if I had to stay at home and keep
the cows out of the grain?</Sentence> <Sentence>But someone had to do it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah was a wizard at learning, and in two years was by far the best
student in the school, and would soon be able to write for her second
class certificate; she must not be held back.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that, I knew too,
that when she got through and was able to teach, she would help me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
was very proud of Hannah, as we all were, Mr. Schultz had said she was
the best student he ever had.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But when in the morning, I saw Bert Ingram and Hannah walking up the
trail on their way to school, when I set out across the creek driving
the cows ahead of me to the pasture, on the School section, the
darkness of the pit was in my soul.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a little brown arithmetic
with me, a slate and pencil and I would lie on my stomach on some
green knoll, and work long division problems and Hannah would mark
them for me at night, and tell me what happened all day, but that did
not dry my tears.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a great friend and advocate in my sister Lizzie who freely gave
her opinion that a pasture should be fenced for the cows, so I could
be able to go to school.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was done at last; a fine grassy field
was fenced in along the creek, and I enjoyed a brief season of
freedom, but unfortunately a dry season came that year, stunting the
grass, and the cattle had to be driven to new places, to supplement
the pasture, and again I had to be the herder.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No one prayed more earnestly for rain than I did, in those stifling
hot days, when an insolent sun came up in a cloudless sky, and glared
down on us all day, as it rode the heavens in sublime indifference to
our needs.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wore boots without stockings, a print dress and a straw
hat, a home-made straw hat, (Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Naismith had shown us how to make
the braid with seven strands of oat straw) and mine was really a small
umbrella in width, held fast under my chin with elastic, making a fine
circle of shade around me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were times when I hated the cows and could have drowned them
gladly, for I felt that they were cheating me of the one thing I most
wanted.</Sentence> <Sentence>My work was all so endless; only at night, when they all lay
asleep behind the pasture bars, was I free, and what good did that do
me?</Sentence> <Sentence>They held me a prisoner as truly as any one was ever held by
prison walls and I could see life passing by me.</Sentence> <Sentence>There could be no
release until the harvest was gathered and threshed and the fields
were free then to all comers.</Sentence> <Sentence>But looking ahead that far seemed an
eternity.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A heavier blow fell on me too that summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had taken the cows out to
the east end of the School-section and let them join the neighbor‚Äôs
herd.</Sentence> <Sentence>The School-section (No.</Sentence> 29) <Sentence>was vacant land and I could have
left them there, but for the danger of their sneaking back to our oat
field into which they had once bolted when I was bringing them home.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Having tasted the young oats, they were not likely to forget.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cattle
never forget anything.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I had to stay.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was busy reading Collier‚Äôs History, with Nap beside me lazily
snapping at flies.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sky was cloudy, with a promise of rain, in the
northwest, where thick dark clouds were piled on the horizon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rain
would save the country, if it came now, for the grain was in the
shot-blade but with the intense heat, was yellowing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rain would bring
up the pasture too, and ease the mental strain from which everyone was
suffering.</Sentence> <Sentence>My people were getting edgy, and cross, with this sorry
business of waiting and hoping and being daily disappointed.</Sentence> <Sentence>To-day, I
had been glad to get out and away by myself, and as I sat on a knoll,
reading about King John and the barons, I wondered about the common
people of that time, and what they were doing and thinking while King
John and his nobles battled at Runnymede.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe they did not know
anything about it, nor cared; perhaps, that was the fate of common
people, to go on raising crops, doing all the drudgery, paying taxes,
fighting when they were called out and, always letting some one else
decide big questions.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz had said something like this one day, when we were having
a history lesson and he told us about the Peasant‚Äôs Revolt in <Location>Germany</Location>
and how one-hundred-and-fifty thousand of them were slaughtered, by
advice of Martin Luther, because they dared to ask for certain simple
privileges, like leaving the farm on which they were born.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and
I didn‚Äôt mention this at home, for we knew Martin Luther was the
father of Protestantism and so somewhat of a god.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sorry to hear
this about Martin Luther.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had thought better of him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The fires of rebellion in my heart were fanned by the agitation going
on now about the railways, and the men at <Location>Ottawa</Location> giving away our
railway rights without consulting the people of <Location>Manitoba</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>Frank
Burnett, who lived near us had been over talking to my brother Will,
and telling him the farmers must organize to strengthen Premier
Norquay‚Äôs hand, or we would be no better than the serfs of <Location>Russia</Location>,
moved about like pawns.</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt know what pawns were but I got the
drift of the argument.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew the Government at <Location>Ottawa</Location> had promised
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company that no other railway would be
allowed to come into <Location>Canada</Location> for twenty years.</Sentence> <Sentence>American companies were
ready to come, but they could not get permission.</Sentence> <Sentence>We wanted them, and
needed them.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was our country!</Sentence> <Sentence>We were doing the work, but we were
powerless!</Sentence> <Sentence>We were the common people!</Sentence> <Sentence>I grew indignant as I read the
history and saw how little the people ever counted, and longed for the
time when I would be old enough to say something.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But my business at the moment was to acquire knowledge.</Sentence> <Sentence>Knowledge
unlocked doors and gave liberty.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had to plug at these books, snatch
every minute I could, and let nothing divert me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah would soon
have her certificate; she would get a school and earn money to hire a
herd boy and set me free.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps I could go to Brandon and work for
my board and go to the High School there, when I was ready.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz had come to see me, the night before, and had praised my
work.</Sentence> <Sentence>My heart was still light as I recalled his wonderful words.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúNellie,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúno one can hold you back‚Äîno condition can defeat
you‚Äîif you keep your health; remember no one can really hurt you, but
yourself.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I turned that over in my mind, not quite sure of its
meaning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I may have been so absorbed in my own thoughts that I did not notice
that Nap had left me.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cows were contentedly grazing in the
lowlands by the creek, where wild pea-vine and goose-grass mixed with
the prairie hay, afforded them excellent pasture.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was roused by dogs barking, and a sudden stampede of the cows;
instinctively I ran toward them calling for Nap.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I saw that two
dogs, Nap and old Jack, the terror of the neighborhood were running
the cows toward the creek, with the whole herd in confusion and panic.</Sentence>
<Sentence>One of the young heifers was bellowing with pain and fright, as the
big black dog hung to her tail.</Sentence> <Sentence>I cried and called, racing with all my
speed.</Sentence> <Sentence>The thing I dreaded was happening!</Sentence> <Sentence>The black dog, belonging to
one of our neighbors had sneaked up on the cows and Nap had joined
him, in his bad work.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tail biting was the unforgivable sin in a dog!</Sentence>
<Sentence>Two of our heifers were carrying short tails now and Nap had been the
cause.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would be shot if it happened again, and it was happening!</Sentence> <Sentence>He
wouldn‚Äôt have done it if this black brute had not started the
chase.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I must reach him .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>make him hear me, before his teeth
closed .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>oh!</Sentence> <Sentence>if some of the cattle would only turn on him, he
would come to his senses‚ÄîI reached him at last, and flung my book at
him, but not before he had swung for one horrible moment on the big
cow‚Äôs tail.</Sentence> <Sentence>He fell back when at last he heard me, and came crawling
to me, abject in his misery.</Sentence> <Sentence>He knew as well as I did what he had
done.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The cattle had crossed the creek, and surged up the opposite bank,
taking refuge in the trees and stood there panting and terrified.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
black dog had disappeared.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went among them trying to quiet them.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
neighbor‚Äôs cattle had separated from ours when the attack began,
running toward their home and I did not know whether any of them had
been bitten or not.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could have killed Nap, I think, in that moment, when I saw the
damage he had done to the big cow.</Sentence> <Sentence>A beautiful two-year-old heifer was
the other victim and her tail was badly torn by the fangs of the black
dog and she was in such a state of fear that I could not get near her.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The big cow let me wash her tail in a water hole below the hill, and I
tore the frill off my petticoat for a bandage, but I could do nothing
for the heifer, who still raced and bawled with pain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I proceeded to deal with Nap, who had come back to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>But how
could I go on thrashing him, when he lay at my feet and took my blows?</Sentence>
<Sentence>I dropped the poplar stick, sick at heart; why should I inflict pain
on a dog, who would pay for his one crazy moment with his life?</Sentence> <Sentence>No one
could beat a dog who was going to be shot; who might not see another
sunrise.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I flung myself down beside him in an agony of grief, and thought my
heart would break with its load.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sorry for the wounded animals
and I was sorry for Nap; and sorry for myself, and it seemed that my
little world had come to a sudden and tragic end.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The cows gathered around me in excitement; it‚Äôs a wonder some of them
did not step on me, but I didn‚Äôt care, if they had, nothing could hurt
me any further.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had gone beyond hurting.</Sentence> <Sentence>When my grief had spent
itself, I sat up and looked around me.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cows had drawn back, and
stood in a circle looking at me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap huddled against me, with his ears
flat against his head, and his eyes on the ground‚Äîthe picture of
guilt.</Sentence> <Sentence>He tried to lick my hand, but his bloody jaws were terrible to
see.</Sentence> <Sentence>I took him down to the creek and washed him carefully, leaving no
outward trace of his misdeeds on his coat.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was lamb-like in his
gentleness; even whimpered a little to try to get a kind word from me.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But I steeled myself against him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a bachelor neighbor who lived near, where we were then and I
decided to go over and get some salve from him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I could get my
hands on the heifer when she quieted down, and perhaps her tail could
be saved.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Nap walked along behind me, and came into the little
house at my heels.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack Thinn was out, but his house was not locked,
of course, and I found the very thing I wanted, a little jar of balm
o‚Äô Gilead salve, the kind my mother always kept on hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hunted for
a clean rag, but all I could find was Jack‚Äôs white shirt and I knew
that was sacred for funerals and the Twelfth of July, but I did find
strings which would help me to fasten the bandages.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I left a note, Jack‚Äôs pen and pad were on the stove, telling him I
would bring the salve back.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I came back with the salve Jack was
home; he had been making hay on the river flats, and he had the kettle
on the fire, to make a cup of tea, and asked me to drink a cup with
him, but I had to get back to the cows.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat black brute should have been shot two years ago,‚Äù he said, when
I told him what had happened.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe took the tails off two year-old
calves this spring.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now any dog that will run a calf is not a dog at
all‚Äîhe‚Äôs a low bred cur.</Sentence> <Sentence>They keep him because he can kill wolves, and
they get the bounty, but I hope your dad insists on him being shot
this time.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs an old brute anyway, and has done his mead of evil.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Not once did it occur to him that Nap might have had a share in the
bad work, and a plan came to me .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>though I knew it was not the
way of truth.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one had seen the dogs‚Äîno one knew.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I might be
able to save Nap.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack was talking still.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDrink a cup of tea, Nellie, you look like a ghost, just look at
yourself in the glass!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was not easy, too many flies had been there ahead of me, but I
could see my face was blood stained and dirty.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBetter wash your face
before your mother sees you‚Äîor you‚Äôll give her a fright.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I can
see the cows from here‚Äîthey‚Äôre all right.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think he saw I had been crying, and being too much of a gentleman to
embarrass me by noticing it, he became highly jocular.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúGosh, Nellie,
you look as if you had been in a fight .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>are you sure you didn‚Äôt
bite the cows?</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew you were pretty mad about having to stay home
and mind them, but I never thought you‚Äôd break right out and bite them
like this, and blame it on the old black dog.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I didn‚Äôt see much fun in Jack‚Äôs raillery, but I knew the kind motive
back of it, so I washed my hands and face, and drank a cup of tea
gratefully.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He offered to help me with the cows, but I knew I could manage them
more easily alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I got back to them I found some of them were
were lying down, and some were cropping the grass.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My mind was in a turmoil.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if I could save Nap.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would
never have chased the cows, if left alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>The death of the old black
dog would be a good thing!</Sentence> <Sentence>A dog that would chase yearling calves had
no license to live.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I tried to straighten out all the strands of evidence.</Sentence> <Sentence>But could not
be sure.</Sentence> <Sentence>A lie was a lie, no matter how justifiable it seemed and
there was a knot in the skein, of my reasoning, which would break the
thread sometime.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was no other way.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I would have to lie to save him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could
not expect mercy for him, if the truth were known.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bob-tailed cattle
would not sell for as much as animals with their tails; and the poor
brutes surely needed the full length of tail to whisk away the
flies.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I knew it would be a great grief to my father too, to have Nap shot
for he loved every animal on the place.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course, if he had seen Nap
with his teeth in the big cow‚Äôs tail and heard her bellow with pain,
he could have shot the dog himself, but for that matter so could I, at
that moment.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother would take the practical view, and set aside her
feelings.</Sentence> <Sentence>The dog was a danger to the cows‚Äîso the dog must go, no
matter how fine he was in other ways, and that would end the matter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The cows walked ahead of us quietly and I had plenty of time to think
my own bitter thoughts.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the sky was unfriendly now.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not a cloud
remained of all the thick dark ones that had been piling up over the
<Location>Brandon Hills</Location> promising rain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Another dry day with shrinking ponds and
withering crops, would not improve tempers, that had been pretty
brittle when I left in the morning.</Sentence> <Sentence>So there was all the more reason
for careful talk on my part to prevent a flare-up.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I would have to lie, clean and straight.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no other way, and I
wouldn‚Äôt tell a soul.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I did want to tell Lizzie; she would have
been so sorry.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wouldn‚Äôt put any share of this load on her or anyone
else.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd have the decency anyway to keep it to myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would do my
own lying.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>The cows stopped to graze on a little low spot that was still green,
so I did not hurry them.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big cow was eating now, but the heifer
paced restlessly through the others, bawling and switching her tail.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
rubbed her head and talked to her, trying to soothe her, but her big
soft eyes were still full of terror.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suppose it was the first pain
she had ever felt, and she didn‚Äôt know how to bear it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîStrangely
enough none of the cattle were one bit afraid of Nap.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt believe
even the big cow knew that the crazy barking fury, with teeth of fire,
that had hurled itself on her was any relation to the friendly furry
friend who went in and out among them every day.</Sentence>

<Sentence>All the family was at home, when I drove the cattle into the pasture
and put up the bars.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told my story and it was believed.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father
declared he would go over to our neighbors the next day and ask that
the black dog be put out of the way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was my brother Jack who pointed out the weak spot in the case.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThey‚Äôll say the dog was at home all day.</Sentence> <Sentence>They probably think he was,
and every one knows Nap has bitten tails too, and what‚Äôs to stop them
saying it was Nap that did the damage.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one saw it but Nellie and
they know she‚Äôs so crazy about Nap, she might lie to save him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNow that‚Äôs enough!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù mother interrupted.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThere isn‚Äôt a person in this
neighborhood that wouldn‚Äôt take Nellie‚Äôs word.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I thought I would choke with humiliation and shame.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fortunately, it
was dusk in the kitchen, so they couldn‚Äôt see my face, but I was
afraid they would hear my heart beating.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúPoor child, it has been a hard day for you,‚Äù mother went on, ‚Äúyou did
well Nellie to get the salve from Jack Thinn, I must give him some
more‚ÄîI am glad I made plenty in the spring when the buds were on.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
don‚Äôt know anything else we can do‚ÄîI think you can compel them to
shoot the black dog, John.</Sentence> <Sentence>Isn‚Äôt it queer that he never goes for any
of their own cattle?</Sentence> <Sentence>They keep him because he‚Äôs a wolf killer.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would
hate to quarrel with a neighbor .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>but what can we do?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Father did not go at once to deliver the ultimatum in regard to the
dog.</Sentence> <Sentence>He kept putting it off, for he could never do a disagreeable
thing.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybe the tails will heal up,‚Äù he said hopefully, when mother
declared she would go herself, if he didn‚Äôt.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was utterly miserable; made more so by the fact that my story was
not doubted.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had had a good name, and had thrown it away.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nap was blithely indifferent.</Sentence> <Sentence>He even went away to my brother Will‚Äôs
place and stayed for days, leaving me alone to take the cattle out,
and that hurt me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Here was I, blackening my soul for him, and a lot he
cared!</Sentence> <Sentence>I suppose he felt a sort of dog-remorse for what he had done
and felt easier in his mind when he was out of my sight.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XVI‚ÄîMen, and Machines</Sentence>


<Sentence>The rain saved me, at least for the present, for the next day, all the
deceptive clouds that had marched across the sky withholding their
rain, came back apologetically and gave us full measure.</Sentence> <Sentence>For three
glorious days, without wind or lightning, a steady rain fell in silver
spears straight into the ground and the withering crop lifted its head
and revived.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed it made a wonderful recovery for when the rain was
over, there came a strong ground heat that lifted the plants, filled
the heads and began the process of ripening.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The whole temper of the neighborhood changed, and my troubles seemed
to have had a happy deliverance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even the two wounded cows were more contented and were now on the way
to recovery.</Sentence> <Sentence>The gashes had closed over, and the heat had gone out of
them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if I could escape as easily as this, and if my
prayers could all be answered in this magnificent way.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seemed very
generous of God, if it were true.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I had my uneasy moments.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was a stern Puritanic part of my conscience that told me I had sinned
and I would suffer.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWithout the shedding of blood there is no
remission of sins!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Had not that been the golden text, the very Sunday
after?</Sentence> <Sentence>What did it mean?</Sentence> <Sentence>But the excitement of the coming harvest,
seemingly secure now, drove away my gloom; and a great event was about
to break, in the effulgence of which, all other considerations paled.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We were going to get a binder.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After the rains, an agent canvassed our neighborhood, a sleek
brown-whiskered fellow who drove a brown team, in a top buggy; and
came first to see us for he was an Owen Sound man.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Company was
offering a special concession to any neighborhood that would buy six
binders.</Sentence> <Sentence>An expert would come and set them running, and repairs would
be left with the blacksmith in Millford.</Sentence> <Sentence>Three-hundred-and-forty
dollars was the price, and the payment would be spread over three
years.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>We had an old reaper, bought secondhand and with it we had cut the two
former crops, but it was inadequate for the eighty acres of wheat,
that lay across the creek, turning yellow now and dimpling in the
gentle wind.</Sentence> <Sentence>The land was clean and strong, and not a weed broke the
symmetry of the even heads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I never say my father happier.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou brought us to a bright land,
Willie,‚Äù he said with emotion, one night as he looked at the ripening
grain.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúAfter grubbing and hoeing and picking stones and pulling
weeds‚Äîthat field brings tears to my eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>This crop will give us a
footing, please God!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was in this state of reverent expectation that the machinery agent
broke in and the binder was bought, and the great day came, when it
was drawn from Brandon.</Sentence> <Sentence>The neighbors went up together and six binders
came in a procession, great red and white machines with carriers of
white canvas.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That very night, Billy, one of our horses (we had just one team)
became sick, and that threw a cloud over the rejoicing.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we made
light of this to each other.</Sentence> <Sentence>Billy would be better in time to do his
share on the binder; we had arranged to hire a horse from one of the
neighbors, and in another year, if this crop came off, as it looked
now‚Äîwe would have another team.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had a good yoke of oxen, fine big
blood-red ones‚Äîa perfect match.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But Billy‚Äôs sickness went on, and developed into a low fever, which
held him to his stall for six weeks, and that was how we had to hitch
Kate with the Oxen.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our neighbor‚Äôs horse met with an accident before
we started cutting by getting caught in the barb wire of the pasture
fence, so the first day of the cutting was robbed of part of its
glory.</Sentence> <Sentence>But, with a fine day of cloudless sky, velvety air, sweet with
the rich scents of ripe grain, bergamot and golden rod, we refused to
be cast down.</Sentence> <Sentence>Kate was hitched beside the oxen and although she gave
every evidence of hating her work-mates, the binder was put into
action; the wheels turned, the knives bit greedily into the yellow
stalks, the canvas carried them aloft; they fell into the bundles and
were tied by the binding twine and dropped on the stubble.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will drove
the binder and the sheaves were set into stooks by Jack and Father.</Sentence>
<Sentence>George was working for a neighbor.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first round was accomplished with difficulty for Kate could not
accustom her pace to the slow steps of the oxen, and could not refrain
from nipping them.</Sentence> <Sentence>But this was remedied by checking her head up, so
she could not reach them.</Sentence> <Sentence>The second round was better, but the third
round the knotter broke‚Äîa casting was faulty and snapped off‚Äîand each
sheaf was thrown down loose, and a piece of idle twine with it.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>Father wanted to go on, he would bind the sheaves the old way,
anything was better than to let the grain stand, for it was dead ripe
and every minute was precious, but Will thought it would be better to
go to Millford and get a new knotter.</Sentence> <Sentence>The agent said there would be
‚Äúparts‚Äù kept there and it would save time in the end.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In Millford, he found there were no knotters, so he had to push on to
Brandon, thirty miles away, and could not get back until the next
morning.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the first day was lost.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Kate made the trip to Brandon, gallant Kate, with her ears back and
her head up.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a quick traveller and evidently never tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>With
a couple of hours rest, after coming back from Brandon she went on the
binder again, leaning over to take a bite at the ox nearest to her, to
let him know that, though she might be a little tired with the long
hours, she still had her pride.</Sentence> <Sentence>I do not know how many times Kate was
driven to Brandon through the night that harvest, but I do know that
she showed no sign of weariness at any time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The story of that binder is a story of grief and the others binders
were no better.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everything went wrong, someone was on the road to
Brandon nearly every night for the parts left with the blacksmith were
not sufficient for the demand.</Sentence> <Sentence>The costs were mounting too, for the
Company disclaimed all responsibility for breakages.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In fact the Company from its office in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> assumed no
responsibility at all, for anything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Their work was done, when they
got the notes signed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they did write letters.</Sentence> <Sentence>My face burns as I
write these words, thinking of the insults they hurled at us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember one lovely day early in September when at least it seemed
that we had replaced every part on the binder that could possibly
break, and all day it had been working well.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah and I carried out
the afternoon lunch as usual.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big pot of tea, hot buttered
biscuits, and on this day we had a fine cranberry pie (with the pits
in) just out of the oven, juicy and sweet.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The binder was working so well every one was holding their breath, and
almost talking in whispers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think it was the first whole day the
binder had worked and the night was not yet!</Sentence>

<Sentence>We liked to carry out the lunch for everyone was glad to see us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even
Kate was glad for it gave her a half hour release from her despised
companions, while she ate her green oats in peace.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no
comment made on the binder‚Äôs fine performance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Irish people are
superstitious about talk; it can breed mischief.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIf you are doing
well, say nothing.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù .</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>We laid out the meal almost in silence.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt looks like the end of the
field tonight,‚Äù Jack said, as he wiped his hands on his overalls.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs full moon and that means we can work a little longer.</Sentence> <Sentence>If we can
see till half past eight, I believe we‚Äôll be done.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My father was sixty-nine at this time, but he was strong and well, and
worked as long hours as the boys.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had a great love for the fields,
and in harvest time, it seemed he was never tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was busy now
rubbing out a head of wheat.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSure, and it is a grand country that can grow forty bushels of this
to the acre.</Sentence> <Sentence>Look at how plump it is and hard, and yellow, packed in
its little case, neat as a baby‚Äôs fingernail.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It‚Äôs great to be
alive on a day like this, with enough to eat, and a bed to lie on.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
it were not for this touch of rheumatism in my knees, I believe I
could work all day and all night too, at as nice a job as standing
sheaves on end for the sun to shine on.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Rest yourself, Willie
lad.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>There‚Äôs always another day, and it will be a good one by
the look of the sky.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs always the danger of frost,‚Äù Will said, as he ate hastily.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The trouble with the binder had put lines in his young face.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah and I waited until the binder started.</Sentence> <Sentence>We would carry the
sheaves for father for a while to save him the stooping, and as we
worked he told us stories of <Location>Ireland</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was talking of the Rock of
Cashel that lies on the plains of <Location>Tipperary</Location>, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Divil‚Äôs Bite‚Äô it is
called,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs what it is.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Devil had come to
<Location>Ireland</Location> to make trouble but the blessed Saint Patrick was there ahead
of him and he could do nothing with the Irish at all, at all, and he
saw he might as well go home to <Location>England</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But before he went, such a
rage came on him, he took a bite out of the hill for spite and made
off with it.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he had bitten off more than he intended, and to hold
it was pulling his back teeth out, so he dropped it just where it lies
on the green plains of <Location>Tipperary</Location>, and up above, you can see the place
it came from.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly the hum of the binder ceased!</Sentence> <Sentence>and we waited in suspense.</Sentence> <Sentence>Had
something gone wrong?</Sentence> <Sentence>We hurried around the end of the field and saw
to our dismay that Will was unhitching.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The tongue of the binder had snapped.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no reason for the
break, for no extra pressure had been put on it.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was an old
crack in the wood, smoothed down and painted over, but there it was!</Sentence>
<Sentence>Anyone would know it would break sometime.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Jack ran to the house
to get two boards; maybe it could be mended to get the field finished.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Will stood looking at it without saying a word.</Sentence> <Sentence>He whistled through
his teeth as if he were cooling his lips.</Sentence> <Sentence>Father looked at the break
and broke into a wild Irish denunciation of the Company, checking
himself in the middle of it to pat Will on the shoulder and say: ‚Äútake
it aisy, lad.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Someone was coming across the field.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Jack Thinn bringing the
mail.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúTrouble again,‚Äù he called across the stubble, ‚Äúone of the axles
of mine broke‚Äîwe worked only two days this week and my grain is
shelling.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tom Aylsby has gone to Brandon for a new wheel.</Sentence> <Sentence>I brought
over the mail.</Sentence> <Sentence>I see the Company has written you a letter, Mr. Mooney.</Sentence>
<Sentence><Location>Nice</Location> letter writers aren‚Äôt they?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will opened the letter and read, I remember this sentence: ‚ÄúEvery part
of our machine is tested by experts, but no machine can do good work
in the hands of a bungling operator, and unfortunately we cannot
supply brains, our business is machinery.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night the sun set clear and cold, and at dawn the next morning
came the frost that caught the standing grain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Two years afterwards when at the Harvest Home Festival in Millford,
one of the professors from the new college just opened in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>,
came out to preach on Sunday and to lecture for us on Monday night and
in the little church there were gathered all the people of our
community.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Reverend Doctor, with his great gifts of oratory, had
warmed our hearts and many an eye glistened as he dwelt on the
opportunities of higher education that the new college made possible
for the boys and girls of today.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe best crop in this fertile valley, so favored in its rich soil and
abundant rainfall is not your number-one-hard wheat, or your
seventy-bushels-to-the-acre oats, or your white-faced Herefords, it is
your boys and girls with their bright faces and eager minds.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>You
came here from your comfortable homes in the East for their sakes, not
your own, and now, dear friends as the Lord has prospered you, we know
we can depend on you for support in this great new enterprise.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The people were nodding their consent and the doctor knew he had his
audience.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am glad to be able to tell you that we have received heartening
messages from people outside our own Province, especially from Eastern
sources.</Sentence> <Sentence>And you will be interested to hear that one of the first
subscriptions and a generous one too, came from the ‚Äî‚Äî Machine Co., of
<Location>Toronto</Location>, whose name I see on many of your machines.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Oh!</Sentence> <Sentence>oh.</Sentence> . . .!

<Sentence>There was an intake of breath in the church, and the atmosphere
curdled and soured like new milk in a thunder storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>The people
squirmed in their seats and their faces changed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Inadvertently the
kindly old doctor had run his hand across old wounds that bled
again:‚ÄîI remembered the letters.</Sentence> . . . ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe cannot supply brains, our
business is machinery.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Coming home in the wagon we discussed it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Liza, (Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ingram‚Äôs Liza,
brought from Woodstock) who happened to be riding with us gave us her
description of what had happened in the church.</Sentence> <Sentence>Liza was the best
berry-picker in the neighborhood and could find berries where the
ordinary person saw nothing but leaves, so Liza drew her illustration
from her own sphere of activity:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat church was like a berry-bush,‚Äù she said, and everyone hushed to
hear what was on Liza‚Äôs mind for she seldom spoke at all.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúA berry
patch with raspberries hanging bigger‚Äôn thimbles everyone pickin‚Äô and
eatin‚Äô!</Sentence> <Sentence>Nicest berries they ever saw.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then at the same minute,
everyone, not one or two mind you, but everyone bit into a raspberry
bug!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before I leave this part of my story, I want to pay my tribute to
Kate, the horse who worked beside the two red oxen with such contempt
for her humble helpers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her bones lie deep in the soil of the farm she
helped to make in the Souris valley, but her memory will endure as
long as any of our family are in the land of remembering.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Billy and Kate were our first horses, bought from Arthur Robinson, Mr.
Schultz‚Äôs brother-in-law, who lived near Hilton in the Tiger hills.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Billy recovered from his long sickness and lived to be a very old
horse, a patient cheerful steady horse, whom anyone could drive, but
Kate was the real personality.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not that she was a likable horse; for
she was never in good humor, and lived in a state of continual
ill-temper, with her ears laid back on her head.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she was a horse
of iron nerve and will.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father explained her bad temper by saying
she couldn‚Äôt help it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She must have been teased when she was a colt.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was never tired, and never sick a day in her life.</Sentence> <Sentence>She lived to be
twenty-five years old, and for the last few years had to have her food
chopped, for her teeth were gone.</Sentence> <Sentence>But not her temper!</Sentence> <Sentence>The colts in the
pasture never made the second mistake of being familiar with her for
she lost no opportunity of taking a nip out of any horse that came
near her, except Billy her mate, for whom she had a real affection.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
can remember how they stood with their necks crossed in the pasture.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Billy died first, and soon after Kate grew too stiff to leave her box
stall.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the last she would not lie down, for I think she knew if she
lay down she could not rise again.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day when my brother Jack was in the barn he heard a sound from her
stall like a long sigh and hurried over to see what was wrong.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
hind legs had given away and she was sitting on her haunches with her
eyes glazed over.</Sentence> <Sentence>Kate had come to the end of the long furrow, but she
died as she lived, with her head up and her ears back!</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XVII‚ÄîLimitations</Sentence>


<Sentence>One Sunday at church I received a great message of comfort from Mr.
Hall, the minister, when he read the passage from Revelation that
describes the outcasts from the heavenly city:‚Äî‚ÄúFor without are dogs,‚Äù
he read and I sat up with a shot through my heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dogs.</Sentence> . . .! <Sentence>I
supposed he meant bad dogs who bit tails.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúSorcerers and
whoremongers,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know any of them.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I did not know what
the words meant, ‚Äúmurderers and idolaters,‚Äù and then I got my message
of comfort, ‚Äúwhosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù My heart sang with
joy.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I was not in that list, for though I had made a lie, I had
not loved it.</Sentence> <Sentence>God, who knows everything would know I had not loved it.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I lied because I couldn‚Äôt help myself, but I did not love it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had my mind almost made up to tell Mr. Hall in the fervor of my
happiness.</Sentence> <Sentence>I craved absolution.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I got no opportunity then, and as
my exaltation faded caution came back.</Sentence> <Sentence>This matter was between God and
me, and I would not widen the base.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Poor Mrs. Dick Walters was a
lesson in keeping one‚Äôs mouth shut.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone knew what had happened to
her.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the revival meetings, held by Mr. Hall at his <Location>Souris City</Location>
appointment Mrs. Walters had fallen under conviction of sin and had
confessed a mishap in her girlhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was only seventeen when it
happened, but as the result of her confession her home was broken, her
husband had cast her off, not that he wanted to, but he felt he had to
prove his manliness to his neighbors.</Sentence> <Sentence>So he put her out without a
dollar.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a coarse, cursing, rough fellow, but he couldn‚Äôt live
in the house with a woman who had sinned!</Sentence> <Sentence>She had reared her eight
children and worked like a slave; had been patient and kind, a good
neighbor‚Äîeverything a woman should be.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was working now in a hotel
in Brandon and her family was lost without her!</Sentence> <Sentence>Oh, if she had only
kept quiet no one would ever have known, for the Isle of Skye is a
long way from <Location>Manitoba</Location>, and thirty years should be long enough to
expiate any sin.</Sentence> <Sentence>I shut my lips tight when I thought of her and
resolved that I would never go to a revival meeting as long as I
lived.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I experienced a great lightening of my heart that day in church.</Sentence>
<Sentence>If God understood, what need I care?</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped now I could forget it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Threshing time came on and I was back at school, and working in a
feverish joy.</Sentence> <Sentence>The days were mistily bright and odorous, full of the
glamor of autumn.</Sentence> <Sentence>The two-mile walk was a progress of beauty‚Äîthe grass
crisp beneath my feet, the sky blue overhead and the <Location>Tiger Hills</Location> mauve
with mystery.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah had told me stories of English history and
recited poetry, as we walked and I had never had a happier time.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
getting on; we were all getting on.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big crop had not turned out as
well as it had promised, but there would be no lack of food and
clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed I never thought of these things.</Sentence> <Sentence>My heart was so full
of the overwhelming thirst for knowledge, I did not place much value
on material things, though I did look forward to a time when I could
earn money, wear well-cut clothes, red in color, and have a pair of
gold cuff-links with a horse‚Äôs head on each one.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one could ask for
more than that from the powers of this world.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was well contented
with my lot in life, especially now since my conscience was clear.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day we had the ‚ÄúMiller o‚Äô the Dee,‚Äù for our reading lesson.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
king was speaking to the merry miller, telling him how fortunate he
was to have plenty but not too much, and no worries with councillors,
advisers, foreign powers, wars, taxes and the other entanglements that
come to vex a king.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was in the Fourth Book then, running neck and
neck with Annie Adams and only a few marks behind her.</Sentence> <Sentence>That day Annie
missed a word in spelling, ‚Äúblythe,‚Äù it was, and when I reached the
head of the class, a dark wave of anger kindled the fair cheek of my
deskmate.</Sentence> <Sentence>Annie liked me in my place, but my place was not ahead of
her, as we stood before the teacher‚Äôs desk.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the first time I
had reached the dizzy heights of being at the head of the reading
class and I may have been offensively proud.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, I was heading for
punishment.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we went out to play Annie handed me a sore blow: ‚ÄúYou needn‚Äôt be
so pleased about getting ahead of me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I let you spell me down because
I am sorry for you.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt know how you can bear to come to school,
wearing your only dress.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone knows you have no Sunday dress now,
and this one is getting too short for you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Ah me, it‚Äôs the truth that hurts!</Sentence> <Sentence>and I reeled under her blow.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
when I recovered I tried to think of something that would be a
crushing reply.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of something too in the next period and I
would say it to her when school was let out, and I knew how I would
say it too.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had not listened to the serial stories in the _Family
Herald_ without learning something.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would draw myself up to my full
height and with a curling lip and a flashing eye hiss out the words.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
could hardly wait for the time to come, so well prepared I was.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äù‚ÄîI would say.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äîdare to taunt me with my lack of raiment!</Sentence> <Sentence>What
are dresses anyway, but things that perish, you, who would clothe the
body and starve the soul.</Sentence> <Sentence>What do you know of the Scottish Chiefs or
the Tales of the Border?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>By noon my anger had cooled, I couldn‚Äôt say it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was too deadly and
anyway, I knew I would have a nice new dress as soon as threshing was
over and mother went to Brandon; and besides I knew something else.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
was going to Brandon myself when mother went.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe that would hold
Miss Adams!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I would let it go!</Sentence> <Sentence>I would have my revenge another way!</Sentence> <Sentence>And I would
never let her see the top of the class again.</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Adams‚Äô sun had set.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I told myself grimly, she would rue the day she taunted me!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The girls at school, Annie included, were doing fancy work at noons
crocheting lace and doing wool-work for table mats on corks with pins,
and I was seized with a desire to create something beautiful too.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
looked quite easy and I got a hook from Lizzie and a spool of white
thread and was all ready to go when I made a painful discovery.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
not easy at all.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not get the right crook in my little finger,
and I seemed to have no way of making the stitches of uniform length.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The veteran fancy workers who were now doing intricate designs in
Gordon braid, raised their eye-brows as they watched my frantic
efforts.</Sentence> <Sentence>I put my tongue out too, which was always a sign with me of
mighty concentration.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I could not make a scallop that had not a
bulge and the thread soon lost its snowy hue.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was hard to take the
things they said as they talked over my head.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even Annie‚Äôs little
sister Maude who had just started to school could do the mile-a-minute
pattern.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was only one thing I could do.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I renounced all forms of handwork; and plunged into the regular work
of the school with greater diligence; though my heart was sore at my
defeat, I professed a great disdain for lace trimmed petticoats and
drawers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Plain ones for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Underwear should be neat but not gaudy!</Sentence>
<Sentence>And how I studied my spellings, drew maps and memorized all the poetry
in our readers; and recited with gestures one Friday afternoon:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe heights by great men reached and kept
    Were not attained by sudden flight,
  But they, while their companions slept,
    Were toiling upward in the night.</Sentence>
  <Sentence>They did not leave their reading books
    To fool around with crochet hooks;
  They did not slight their history-notes
    To make lace for their petticoats;
  But step by step they did advance
    And gave no thought to coat or pants!</Sentence>
  <Sentence>So let my steps be ever led
    Away from wool, and crochet thread;
  And let my heart be set to find
    The higher treasures of the mind.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I did not get clear away.</Sentence> <Sentence>The crochet squad were not deceived by my
high resolves.</Sentence> <Sentence>Little Maude Adams tried to comfort me by telling me
her mother knew a woman once who couldn‚Äôt crochet or do any fancy work
either and it was all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt help it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her father and
mother were cousins.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XVIII‚ÄîRetribution</Sentence>


<Sentence>A few nights after this, something happened that made me forget the
head of the class, my high resolves, the new dress, or the trip to
Brandon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I came home from school, changed my one dress into an old gingham
which had been Hannah‚Äôs, and ran out to dig potatoes for supper.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
liked digging potatoes; maybe, because I was not often allowed to do
it for father liked to dig them himself, but he was helping the
Ingrams to thresh.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was lovely to see the big ones rolling out of
the ground, and to keep from cutting them with the hoe required some
skill.</Sentence> <Sentence>The straw stacks gleamed like piles of pure gold on the faded
stubble; the grass was tawny and crisp with autumn; and the cattle
could run now anywhere they liked and I was free‚Äîfree until the crop
grew again, and that was a long time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly it occurred to me that I had not seen Nap.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had not come to
meet us at Kennedy‚Äôs corner as usual.</Sentence> <Sentence>A man was coming up the bank of
the creek, it was Jimmy Sloan, the waterman of the threshing outfit.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He came running up from the creek where he had been filling his water
tank from the big pool.</Sentence> <Sentence>The threshers were working at Mr. Ingram‚Äôs;
but Jimmy still came to the big pool on our farm for water for the
engine.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The increased crops had shelved the old-fashioned horse-power
machines, and a new steam thresher owned by Billy Ferguson of <Location>Glenboro</Location>
had come into our neighborhood.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI think your dog is in trouble, Nellie,‚Äù Jimmy called to me, ‚ÄúI saw
him this afternoon fighting with a boar, that belongs to Jack Thinn.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
tried to get him away, but Nap seemed to think he should finish the
fight.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was pretty badly chewed but game for more.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhere is he?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked, distressed at the thought of Nap being hurt.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAcross the creek, on the ploughed field they were,‚Äù Jimmy said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBut
I don‚Äôt see anything of them now; maybe Nap has come home, though, has
he?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo, he hasn‚Äôt come home!</Sentence> <Sentence>Take in the potatoes Jimmy,‚Äù I said,
thrusting the pail into his hands.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI must find him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The short October evening was drawing in, it would soon be dark, and I
never needed daylight so terribly.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap may be lying bleeding to death
some place where I could not see him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I ran across the creek bed and
over to the ploughed field.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were signs of deadly combat; black
hair and blood; the ground torn up.</Sentence> <Sentence>I ran and called and listened.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The stillness of evening mocked me, gentle sounds of cow bells, loaded
wagons, the distant hum of the threshing machine, voices, cows lowing,
geese clearing their throats.</Sentence> <Sentence>A warm breath of air from somewhere
quickly replaced by the cool breeze.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúO Nap, Nap,‚Äù I called.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúAnswer
me!</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I turned back to get Hannah to help me, and crossed the creek farther
up, and as I raced over the bank, something caught my eye in the
bushes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Something that made my heart skip a beat.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Nap, a poor
bundle of blood-stained fur.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had tried to crawl home and had fallen
here, weak from loss of blood.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knelt beside him in the gray light, and saw, to my great joy that he
was still living; but with every beat of his heart, blood flowed
from his breast, torn open by the boar‚Äôs fangs.</Sentence> <Sentence>He knew me and tried
to lift his ears.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I ran to the house for flour, to stop the blood and came back with a
milk-pan full, and a roller towel, taken from the clothes line.</Sentence> <Sentence>I put
handfuls of flour on his breast, but the red stains came through.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then
I piled on all I had and wrapped him in the towel as tightly as I
could draw it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He felt horribly limp and lifeless.</Sentence> <Sentence>I ran down to the
pool where Jimmy was still filling the water tank with a pail.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôll have to carry him Jimmy,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI can‚Äôt lift him and I am
afraid he‚Äôs going to die.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôve got to take the water back to the machine,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll
come right back.</Sentence> <Sentence>This is my last load for the night.</Sentence> <Sentence>Get a drink of
milk for him, if he can swallow, and I‚Äôll be back as soon as I can.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Now remember a dog can take a lot of killing, and as long as he is
breathing there‚Äôs a chance.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I got a bowl of milk from the milk house, and went back and sat beside
him and talked to him in an agony of remorse.</Sentence> <Sentence>Was it for this I had
saved him, by lying for him?</Sentence> <Sentence>Saved him from a quick merciful death, to
die like this?</Sentence> <Sentence>One quick straight bullet if I had told the truth, and
then no more of anything, no pain, no bleeding, no fear, no blinding
rage,‚Äîjust peace and a great darkness and the day ended, his happy
dog‚Äôs day over.</Sentence> <Sentence>But now, he was broken, bleeding, suffering, and I
could not save him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was out of my hands now.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Sometimes I thought his breath had stopped, so faint it was.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wet my
fingers in the milk and put them on his tongue, but he made no
response.</Sentence> <Sentence>But still I felt he knew me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you, Nap,‚Äù I told him and I know he was glad to have me
beside him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jimmy came back and hitched one of his horses to the stone-boat.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
could have done that myself, but there was not a horse or an ox on the
place‚Äîand all our men were helping at the threshing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy thought
this was easier for Nap than to be carried.</Sentence> <Sentence>We got Nap into the old
house, now used as a granary, and put him on a pile of grain sacks.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou can‚Äôt do anything more,‚Äù Jimmy said to me.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNow don‚Äôt you stay
out here, breaking your heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll put this horse blanket over him
and you go on into the house.</Sentence> <Sentence>He may live, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on
it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was dark in the granary and I went into the house to get a lantern.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother came back with me, and looked at Nap.</Sentence> <Sentence>His eyes were closed but
he moved an ear when she spoke to him.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am sorry for you, Nellie,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut if he does die, it will
be a relief in a way.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve been afraid he might chase the cows
sometime, or the neighbors‚Äô cows and have to be shot.</Sentence> <Sentence>When a dog gets
a bad habit, its hard to break him.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôll warm some milk and feed it
to him with a spoon, and put hot bricks beside him; he‚Äôs cold from the
loss of blood.</Sentence> <Sentence>You go in and warm the milk and I‚Äôll stay beside him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I brought back the milk and held the lantern while mother tried to
make him swallow.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the milk ran down his jaws.</Sentence> <Sentence>She shook her head.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI think he‚Äôll be gone in the morning,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúRemember, he‚Äôs only
a dog, child, and not many dogs live out their days.</Sentence> <Sentence>If he‚Äôs living in
the morning we will wash the blood off him and dress his wounds, but I
don‚Äôt think it is well to disturb him now.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I nearly told her then, but I knew it would hurt her to know I could
lie so stoutly as I had.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt eat that night, nor did I look at
a book.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîI slipped out again with my coat on, for it was cold in the
granary; and I sat beside him in the dark, stroking his head.</Sentence> <Sentence>If he
were going to die, I wanted to be with him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had carried him in my
arms when he was a pup, watched him grow into the lovely dog he had
been; had him these years for my friend and playmate; we had sat
together on the hills and minded the cattle,‚Äîhe had guarded the
hen-house door, when I forgot it‚Äîhe could all but speak to me; and
always knew if I were worried.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would stay with him if he were going
to die, but over and above my grievings, I could feel, in the silence
of that long night in the granary, there was a power that was working
in life, a great unseen power, a law, an unchanging law, and Nap and
I, and everyone was subject to it, and we couldn‚Äôt escape it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
couldn‚Äôt pray that night.</Sentence> <Sentence>It all seemed so useless.</Sentence> <Sentence>The power of the
law was so heavy, so inexorable.</Sentence> <Sentence>Without the shedding of blood there
is no remission of sins!</Sentence> <Sentence>And I thought I could change that with a lie!</Sentence>
<Sentence>And some have thought they could change it with prayer.</Sentence> <Sentence>The laws of
God could not be changed.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were like the multiplication tables.</Sentence>
<Sentence>How pitiful we were in our helplessness, under the law.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>under
the law.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why had there to be such suffering?</Sentence> <Sentence>And who asked to be born
anyway?</Sentence> <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt!</Sentence> <Sentence>Neither did Nap!</Sentence> <Sentence>Nobody did!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Through the window above my head, I could see a bright star, twinkling
in the western sky.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if there were
people living on it, and if they were under the law, or if they cared?</Sentence>
<Sentence>The world was so big, and this star was a world too.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It began to
blot me out.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>It was grey day when I wakened, and a pale light was draining in
through the window.</Sentence> <Sentence>The granary with its discarded harness, boxes,
fanning mill, horse collars hanging on nails, parts of machinery, took
shape.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I remembered and looked at Nap; he was still living, but
his body still had a terrible coldness and his eyes were dim.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went into the house and lighted the kitchen fire.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother would soon
be up and she‚Äôd be glad to have the fire burning.</Sentence> <Sentence>I put the kettle on;
I would try again to get Nap to take hot milk.</Sentence> <Sentence>She came into the
kitchen then.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre up early dear, I didn‚Äôt hear you come down and
that‚Äôs queer, I thought I heard everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Is he still alive?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I
nodded.</Sentence> <Sentence>She didn‚Äôt know I had been out all night.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The fire was crackling cheerfully and hot porridge would soon be
steaming on the table.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother‚Äôs face looked heavenly to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt
put it into words, but some glimmering of life‚Äôs plan swept across my
mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sorrow and joy, pain and gladness, triumph and defeat were in
that plan, just as day and night; winter and summer, cold and heat,
tears and laughter.</Sentence> <Sentence>We couldn‚Äôt refuse it, we must go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We couldn‚Äôt
go and sulk in a corner and say we wouldn‚Äôt play.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The sun swept up over the horizon and all the landscape kindled and
blazed.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a new day and I was part of it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was taking wood for the fire out of the oven where she had put
it to dry.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNow call the men, Nellie, we‚Äôre all a bit late this
morning.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I came back she was stirring the porridge.</Sentence> <Sentence>The day‚Äôs routine had
begun.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cows were standing at the pasture bars, and the milk pails
were waiting outside on the bench, scalded and aired.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was glad of
the cows standing at the bars, bawling indolently, just to be doing
something, glad I had to go out and milk them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Work!</Sentence> <Sentence>That was life‚Äôs
remedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not philosophy or explanations.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no formula, no
answer for the old problems.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we could go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had to go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
were like horses on horse power engines, travelling in circles, not
knowing why we were doing it, but just as they were accomplishing
something, maybe we were too.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou look tired Nellie,‚Äù mother was saying.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre fretting too much
over the dog.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never thought you took anything hard; for you are
Irish, like your father, and light-hearted, but you mustn‚Äôt worry over
what you can‚Äôt help.</Sentence> <Sentence>Animals will fight; their instinct drives them.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Nap thought he was protecting us when he attacked the boar.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cats kill
birds, just because it is their nature; they are driven by their
instincts and they can‚Äôt be blamed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nature is cruel, I often wonder
why; red in tooth and claws.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I went outside to milk, I felt better.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never could be gloomy in
the sunshine.</Sentence> <Sentence>The morning glow burned in the windows of the Ingram
house and came back in a glittering beam.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hens were coming out of
their house, full of cheerful observations and when I pulled my
milking stool over to the big cow, she put her foot back, and turned
her head toward me, with a friendly look in her big eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I laid my
head against her warm white flank, and was grateful for the comfort of
it, and as the milk foamed in the bright tin pail with a rhythmic
thrumming, the little cow came up behind me so close, I could feel her
soft breath on my neck.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were bright spots in life‚Äôs pattern.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>Nap did not die.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stayed home from school with him for a week, and by
that time he was well enough to walk, but he lurched and swayed
uncertainly.</Sentence> <Sentence>He lived on milk for two weeks and had three eggs a
day,‚Äîbut we did not let him know he was getting eggs, because he might
be tempted to help himself later.</Sentence> <Sentence>Billy Smith, the butcher who came
once a week from <Location>Glenboro</Location>, brought him bones, and a new growth came to
him, making him a bigger, finer dog than he had ever been.</Sentence> <Sentence>And as I
saw this great growth and bounding spirits come back to Nap, my burden
of guilt was lifted.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XIX‚ÄîMy First Sight of Brandon</Sentence>


<Sentence>Mother, Jack and I went to Brandon the first week of December, on a
load of wheat, and for a thirty-mile drive on a heavily loaded sleigh,
necessitating a slow pace, it is a cold way of travelling.</Sentence> <Sentence>But with
plenty of robes and by running behind the sleigh, occasionally, we
managed very well.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a bright winter day with new snow, loud with frost.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every fence
post and leafless silver willow shrub, every clump of willow wands
bordering the streams, every roof of house or stable was edged with
hoar frost that glinted and sparkled as the sun rose.</Sentence> <Sentence>The world with
its glittering whiteness, blue sky and chiming sleigh-bells, was one
glorious come-to-life Christmas card.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I know a verse about a snowy morning, which I wanted to recite to
mother, but it is not easy to recite through a woollen scarf and
besides I was shy about reciting poetry before Jack, who would think I
was trying to show off.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack had a high disdain for anything
sentimental, and had not wanted to put the sleigh-bells on the horses
but mother held firm on that, for sleigh-bells had a significance to
her.</Sentence> <Sentence>The winter of the deep snow when she had gone alone for three
long and terrible weeks, with snow so deep no one could get through,
the signal of release had been young Robert Lowery‚Äôs sleigh-bells, as
he ploughed his team through the snow, and she said the bells of
heaven could not be sweeter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to recite: ‚ÄúThe snow had begun in the gloaming, and busily
all the night had been heaping field and highway with a silence deep
and white.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù But I couldn‚Äôt break through.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, I would tell her
about it, when we were alone.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was curious to see what happened to the <Location>Brandon Hills</Location>, as we
travelled nearer to them.</Sentence> <Sentence>From our place the <Location>Brandon Hills</Location> make a dark
blue shoulder that rises abruptly from the plains, but as we
approached, this prominence straightened out and become merely a
countryside of small hills and shadowy blue valleys with farm
buildings here and there, in sheltered places.</Sentence> <Sentence>Columns of smoke
climbing straight into the clean air from the houses, and a few cattle
circling a straw stack made the only bits of color in this white
world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We reached the <Location>Black Creek</Location> Stopping house at noon, and had dinner with
Mrs. Corbett.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Corbett had belonged to the Salvation Army in
<Location>Winnipeg</Location>, before she came to the <Location>Black Creek</Location>, and was rejoicing over
the Army‚Äôs conquest of Brandon.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAin‚Äôt it grand entirely,‚Äù she said as she served us from the stove,
‚Äúhow well the Army is doin‚Äô in Brandon, and I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô you there‚Äôs an
improvement here too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Harry Lovey‚Äîmaybe you know him, he drives for
Nicoll‚Äôs big farm‚Äîteams every day to Brandon and back, well he‚Äôs got
it, and asks a blessin‚Äô at the table here, yes sir, in all the rush
and bustle of this room, says Harry in a high hollow voice not a bit
like his own, ‚ÄòLet us return thanks!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô and mind you, every head went
down.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>ÄîThey say he preached over at <Location>Brandon Hills</Location>, when the minister
couldn‚Äôt get through, on account of the snow, and them that heard him
says he can bate Mr. Cheney all to the devil.</Sentence> <Sentence>Oh, he‚Äôs a man of
education is Harry but it‚Äôs small use he‚Äôs been puttin‚Äô it to,
heretofore.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>You should go Mrs. Mooney, and take your little
girl, when you‚Äôre in Brandon.</Sentence> <Sentence>She‚Äôll never forget it, at her age,
she‚Äôs old enough to take it in too.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll see,‚Äù mother said in her guarded way.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLittle girls of her age
are best in bed.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Corbett‚Äôs stopping house was one big room, with one end used for
a kitchen, in which stood a great high-oven black stove where Mrs.
Corbett with quick movements filled the plates with a cut of roast
beef and helpings of turnips, potatoes and gravy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each man, who was
helped took a place at the long table, covered with oilcloth, where he
found everything else he needed.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDa,‚Äù Cosbett, traversed the length of the table with a blue enamel
tea pot and filled the cups that were stationed at every place.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bread
and butter, pickles, biscuits and cheese were set at close intervals,
along the length of the table and it took but little time to serve
thirty or forty men.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother and I were set at a little table near the stove and our plates
were brought to us.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs a treat to see a woman,‚Äù said Mrs. Corbett, in her friendly way.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She was a tall woman, with a pair of long jet earrings that lashed
around her face as she talked.</Sentence> <Sentence>She wore an embroidered <Location>Jersey</Location> and a
short black skirt, and a clean white apron with a pointed bib, trimmed
with Gordon braid.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI saw there was a woman drivin‚Äô in and I grabbed my white apron, that
I keep here in the drawer of the cupboard.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs women that notice; men
just want their vittles and a lot they care who gives it to
them.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúAnd the first thing I thought, Mrs. Mooney, when I saw you, was that
I was glad I had the place white washed after the flies were done.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
the walls are clean, no one will notice the floors, for floors can be
dirtied in a few minutes, but it takes time to dirty walls and no one
minds new dirt, anyway.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Corbett had set us near to her so she could get a chance to talk,
and said so frankly.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs a relief to get my eyes on a woman and they come so seldom too.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There‚Äôs pie for dessert, little girl, so don‚Äôt be fillin‚Äô yourself too
full of potatoes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou can accommodate a great many people here,‚Äù mother said
admiringly, ‚Äúyou are a good manager, I can see.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWell I do and I am, you might say.</Sentence> <Sentence>You see the lads are all fightin‚Äô
hungry and that‚Äôs a great help, though it‚Äôs hard on the grub.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
they‚Äôre not nosey, I‚Äôll say that for them.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHaven‚Äôt you any help at all?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù asked mother.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúJust Da and Peter Rocket over there, and Peter just scrapes plates
and washes them and Da keeps the table filled and pours the tea.</Sentence> <Sentence>Peter
is not as bright as some but a good lad too.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs good money, forty cents a meal, women and children free, and
glad to see them, and then a stable fee of twenty-five cents a team,
if you bring your own oats.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôre not doing so badly at that, and
everyone is pleasant, poor lads, I often wonder how they are, comin‚Äô
in so cold and discouraged with the price of wheat so low; and them
havin‚Äô to wait in a line for hours to get it sold.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was ladling out food on two plates as she talked.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe farmer is
the only man that has to take what he can get for his stuff,‚Äù she went
on, shouting at us over the shoulder of a big teamster who stooped
down to get his plate filled and then turned back to get another baked
onion.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBecause there are so many of them all raisin‚Äô the same stuff and
instead of helpin‚Äô each other by standin‚Äô together and lettin‚Äô one man
speak for all of them, they cut each other‚Äôs throats without meanin‚Äô
to, but maybe they‚Äôll learn.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúCome and get your pie sissy, and a piece for your mother, here‚Äôs
raisin‚Äô and this is dried apple‚Äîtake the raisin‚Äô; Peter, come here and
pour tea, Da‚Äôs gone out and the men are lookin‚Äô for it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôm washin‚Äô dishes,‚Äù Peter said stolidly, ‚Äúand I‚Äôd have to wash my
hands before I could pour tea for anywan.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>wait a minute.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could see he was a lout of a boy, who could not even think of two
things at once.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was an impatient rattling of spoons on cups.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I jumped up and
went to the stove.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLet me do it,‚Äù I said, and took the smallest pot on the stove and
went down the line.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could hear Mrs. Corbett‚Äôs voice above the chatter.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLook at that now, there‚Äôs a girl with a quick turn, and her not more
than twelve years old.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd be a proud woman, if I had a little girl
like that comin‚Äô along.</Sentence> <Sentence>By gosh, I like action.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>After the men had eaten they sat on the benches beside the stove and
soon the room was blue with smoke.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou might as well rest a while,‚Äù said Mrs. Corbett to us, ‚Äúthere will
be no chance of sellin‚Äô the wheat tonight.</Sentence> <Sentence>That street leadin‚Äô to the
elevator is one solid line of teams up till eight o‚Äôclock every night.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The thing is to get your load in the line and leave it there, and hook
up early in the mornin‚Äô and if you‚Äôre early enough you may be able to
edge up nearer the elevator.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs a crime the way the grain companies
treat the farmers.</Sentence> <Sentence>And the railways and all.</Sentence> <Sentence>Look what happened to
<Location>Grand Valley</Location>!</Sentence> <Sentence>Just because McVickers wanted too much for his farm,
when they were lookin‚Äô for a townsite the whole place had to suffer.</Sentence>
<Sentence>My sister and her man were there, built a house and all; sure the
railway would come, they had been promised it, but what of that.</Sentence> . . .
<Sentence>The Syndicate was not carin‚Äô, and changed the station to Brandon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs.
Mooney, it‚Äôs time the women had something to say about things.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My mother shook her head.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a woman‚Äôs place,‚Äù she said, with her Scotch voice.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúSurely,
if men can‚Äôt do these things, there‚Äôs no use of women trying.</Sentence> <Sentence>It will
all come in time, don‚Äôt you think?</Sentence> <Sentence>Remember the country is young and
the men are so busy getting a foot hold.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes, and that‚Äôs the time women should get into things, and get
everything off on the right foot.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I weren‚Äôt so busy feedin‚Äô hungry
men and makin‚Äô bread and pies in my spare time, I could think out a
few things.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe you‚Äôll do it sissy, when you grow up.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybe I will,‚Äù I said eagerly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we were in the sleigh again, Mother told me, I should not be so
forward.</Sentence> <Sentence>It did not look well for a little girl to jump up and pour
tea for strange men.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Corbett was well able to run her own house;
and all that talk about women doing things was nonsense.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs women‚Äôs
place to help the men and keep out of public matters and out of public
notice.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Corbett talks too much, and has a certain boldness about her
that I do not like, with those swinging earrings she looks like a
gypsy.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I was not pleased with you, Nellie.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack agreed with her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack was sixteen and knew a lot.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI felt cheap,‚Äù
he said, ‚Äúwhen the men at the table were all saying: ‚ÄòGot a new
waiter, eh?</Sentence> <Sentence>Who‚Äôs the kid?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô Some of them knew too, who you were.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWell, supposing they did,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt spill the tea down
anyone‚Äôs neck, did I?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNellie, not a word, you‚Äôre too ready with an answer, your brother is
right.</Sentence> <Sentence>You did a bold thing, getting out there where everyone could
see you.</Sentence> <Sentence>Though I know you did it on impulse and with a desire to
help, but it did not look modest.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúShe did it to show off,‚Äù Jack said, ‚Äúand nothing else, she likes to
be noticed; we made a mistake in bringing her.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The argument was an old one and I did not pursue it further.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could
see nothing wrong in what I had done.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why shouldn‚Äôt I pour tea for
strange men?</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was wrong in her attitude this time, but I would
be free some day and I was not going to be cast down over it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got
off the sleigh and ran behind a while and put the whole matter out of
my mind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We came into Brandon from the southeast, passing the great yellow
brick Court House, the largest building I had ever seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>The new
wooden houses, scattered irregularly over the white prairie looked
like children‚Äôs blocks thrown down in a hurry, only they were all one
color, in the pale light of evening, pinkish yellow, the color of
human faces.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had wondered how the houses were arranged in a city;
were they continuous?</Sentence> <Sentence>or were there gaps between?</Sentence> <Sentence>and if so, what were
in the gaps?</Sentence> <Sentence>It bothered me, but I would soon know, so I said nothing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we got into the city, we passed down a long street of stores, and
other places of business standing side by side.</Sentence> <Sentence>Outside the stores fur
coats and fur robes hung, horse collars, and sets of harness with
brass trimmings, and in front of one a full-sized painted wooden
Indian wrapped in a blanket.</Sentence> <Sentence>Through the frosted windows red lamps
shone, and in the small clear spaces I could see that some of the
lamps had slashed red tissue paper shades hung over them, and I hoped
they would not catch fire.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sidewalks seemed to be full of
merchandise, zinc tubs, wheelbarrows, axe handles and so many things
that the people had to step into the street in some places.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were
people everywhere I looked, nearly all men, in fur coats and caps.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The predominant smell was of lumber, shingles and tar paper and from
the time we entered the city, we could hear sounds of building,
hammering and sawing; loads of lumber were drawn through the crowded
narrow street.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Here was life and color and movement in this great, swarming city, and
we would be here for two nights and a day.</Sentence> <Sentence>My resentment faded out, in
this new bewildered happiness.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack knew his way around, having been here many times the winter
before on the grain sleighs.</Sentence> <Sentence>He drove straight down to <Location>Pacific Street</Location>
to the Farmer‚Äôs Home, a high unpainted new hotel facing the railway
track.</Sentence> <Sentence>I liked the location for now I would see the trains.</Sentence> <Sentence>Generally
my people stayed at the Kelly House, but there had been some fights
and disturbances of drunken men there, and the Farmer‚Äôs Home, being
newer, was considered quieter.</Sentence> <Sentence>We got a nice room, with one across the
hall, for Jack, and when we got freshened up a little, went down for
supper, to a long narrow dining room, lighted by bracket lamps and a
large glass fringed chandelier.</Sentence> <Sentence>The table napkins in fan shapes flared
out of heavy water glasses and the table cloth had a red edge.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúCan we go to hear the Salvation Army tonight?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI would like
to go.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt let her mother,‚Äù Jack began, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs too young to be out at
night.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am too tired to go,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúmy face burns with the wind, but
I‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs anyone going from here.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd like you to go, won‚Äôt
you take her Johnny?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù‚Äî</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI won‚Äôt go with him,‚Äù I said, getting in ahead of him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack explained his side of the case.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI don‚Äôt want her trailing after
me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I want to go with some fellows I was talking to at the Stopping
House.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The waitress solved the problem.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a tired, sad young woman,
with a drooping face and carriage and I think it was her extreme
homeliness that made mother believe in her trustworthiness.</Sentence> <Sentence>She must
be a good girl, with a face like that.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her hair was draggled and her
mouth sagged.</Sentence> <Sentence>She looked like a doll that had been out in the rain.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother always took to homely people or bitter medicines.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had
confidence in them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember once a doctor prescribed something for
her and because it was pleasant to the taste she wouldn‚Äôt take it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
could not possibly have any virtue.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bertha, the waitress said, in her sad way, she would be glad to take
the little girl, and she was going to the Army.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, she was going
alone, though she might meet a friend there.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it was all right,
she‚Äôd be in early.</Sentence> <Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt get out before half past eight though,
on account of having to do part of the dishes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I offered to help, and Bertha said I could.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôs a nice quiet girl,
I can see,‚Äù mother said, when I came up to the room to get my coat and
cardigans.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNow, Nellie, remember, this is a big wicked city, and
you‚Äôre an innocent little country girl, and don‚Äôt be picking up with
strangers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Your fault is you are too friendly.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had one of the olive green homespun coats with a red flannel lining
in it, a great long red scarf that wrapped around me like the
Highlander‚Äôs plaidie, a red toque, with a tassel and red mittens.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bertha took my hand, and we set out, in fine spirits.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were no
street lights, but never having seen street lights I did not miss
them.</Sentence> <Sentence>We could see the sleighs of wheat filling the road-way dimly
outlined in the frosty starlight.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a walk,‚Äù Bertha said, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôll go in and get warmed
where the Medicine show is going on, if we can get in.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went up <Location>Sixth Street</Location> and then climbed a stairs that creaked and
groaned beneath our feet, to a hall above a harness shop.</Sentence>

<Sentence>People were standing at the back of a bright room and we pushed in.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
was warm, but not pleasant, for the odors of wet fur and stale tobacco
smoke polluted the air.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I wanted to hear what was going on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A man with a red satin coat edged with gray fur, had a bottle in his
hand, and a table beside him was full of similar bottles and a lady,
in green satin, sat at a piano, facing the audience.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHere it is, ladies and gents,‚Äù he was saying.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe greatest living
known remedy, no drugs, no stupifying narcotics but distilled from
Nature‚Äôs choicest, sweetest, most powerful herbs, and bitter herbs and
grasses, fed by the dew and rain, and sweetened by the sun, planted on
earth for suffering humanity.</Sentence> <Sentence>The old doctor‚Äôs greatest discovery,
Nature‚Äôs own remedy to rout, dispel, and destroy disease and bring
back lustre to the eyes and roses to the cheek, lightness to the step
and joy to the heart, bitter on the tongue and purifying to the blood.</Sentence>
<Sentence>If the blood is right, you‚Äôre all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>Don‚Äôt take my word for it,
I‚Äôll show you what it does; Miss Lipkin show the tape worm.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The pianist lifted a glass jar from the top of the piano and held it
aloft.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúForty-one feet long, head on both ends and a knot in the middle, and
this was eliminated when the second bottle was taken, by a party in
your midst, whose name will not be mentioned but can be ascertained.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Given up by doctors, as a last resort he tried our remedy‚Äîthe great
swamp root bitters, and today is a well man.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>leaping and running
as one of old.</Sentence> <Sentence>Step up ladies and gents, and spend a dollar on your
health.</Sentence> <Sentence>The great health restorer.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>What is your trouble?</Sentence> <Sentence>It can
relieve them all.</Sentence> <Sentence>Floating kidneys, fallen arches, glands in the neck
or sty on the eyes, boils, bunions, erosions or eruptions, the ip, the
pip, the peesy-weesy, or the gout.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>More people crowded in now, and we were nearer the front.</Sentence> <Sentence>The pianist
was handing out the bottles and receiving the dollar bills.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had my
little purse fastened into my coat pocket with a safety pin.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got it
out, and extracted the one dollar it contained.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the chance of a
lifetime!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Putting the bottle inside my coat, I could hold it easily with my
elbow and Bertha and I went down the stairs.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybe your mother won‚Äôt
like you spending your dollar this way,‚Äù said Bertha sadly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúOh but
she will,‚Äù I said quickly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôm glad I came, maybe this will cure her.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She has headaches you know, it won‚Äôt freeze under my coat, will it?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
Bertha thought not.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went down the street and came to the <Location>Army Barracks</Location> where a great
crowd of people were milling around the door.</Sentence> <Sentence>Inside a drum beat, and
a fife shrilled a tune.</Sentence> <Sentence>Under a street light, a man in blue uniform
was leading the singing, clapping his hands together to keep them
warm;‚Äî‚ÄúFor you there is cleansing in the blood.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>A man came up to us and spoke to Bertha.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat‚Äôs been keeping you?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he
said crossly.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll bet that‚Äôs her brother,‚Äù I thought.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI came as soon as I could, Fred, honest I did, we‚Äôre awful busy now,
at the house.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then he noticed me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he asked, rudely, I thought.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She explained my presence.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúCan she get back alone?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Fred asked pointedly, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt take her
down there.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go Fred, not tonight.</Sentence> <Sentence>You see I got the kid on my
hands.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fred took her arm, and hustled her along, but they talked so low, I
couldn‚Äôt hear what they said.</Sentence> <Sentence>I followed along behind them.</Sentence> <Sentence>We came to
a brilliantly lighted hall.</Sentence> <Sentence>Music, violin music, punctuated by drum
beats, came out to us and the rhythmic scuffle of dancing feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
blinds were up and I could see the dancers weaving and passing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fred and Bertha hesitated for a minute and I saw her hand him a
slender roll of bills.</Sentence> <Sentence>A big sign in the window said: ‚ÄúGent‚Äôs $1.00,
Ladies, free.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went in.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had forgotten me by this time, but I followed them
in.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was one man in the middle of the room acting funny like a clown
and people were laughing at him, as he snatched at the girls who
danced past him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Suddenly he fell on his face and the orchestra
stopped and everyone rushed together.</Sentence> <Sentence>They carried him out through a
back door and the music began again, and no one seemed to think any
more about him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were two narrow stairs leading up to a less brightly lighted
place above, where I could see people eating and drinking at little
tables.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly, I shrank back into my corner and pulled my toque down over
my face.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack had just come in with two other young fellows and was
walking over to the place marked, ‚ÄúGent‚Äôs overcoats.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Now, I must get
out!</Sentence> <Sentence>If Jack saw me, he would feel it his duty to take me right back
to the hotel.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I looked for Bertha and Fred but the floor was
crowded with dancers and I couldn‚Äôt see them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, I could tell the
man at the door who took the money, that I was going and if Bertha
were looking for me‚Äîhe would tell her.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I didn‚Äôt think Bertha would
remember anything about me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had seen girls go into a trance of
delight like this when they had a beau.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I made my escape safely for no one took the slightest notice of me.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The man at the door cut short my explanations with a wave of his hand.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The air was still frosty and it smelled late.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed the street beyond
the circle of light looked black and wicked.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I wasn‚Äôt going to be
afraid.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was nothing to be afraid of, and I would know the
Farmer‚Äôs Home when I came to it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hotels are always open.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The street had a strange look to me as I started out.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still I could
ask, if I were not sure,‚Äîbut I wished Bertha hadn‚Äôt deserted me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I started off quickly, I might be afraid but I wouldn‚Äôt let on I was.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I‚Äôd find the Farmer‚Äôs Home all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was just over there about a
half mile;‚Äînot any farther than the cross-ways of the pasture at home.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It wouldn‚Äôt take me long, and I could run when I got away from the
lights.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A man was walking very fast behind me, gaining on me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was getting
frightened as his heavy steps drew nearer.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no use in
running.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that.</Sentence> <Sentence>If you run, it shows you are afraid.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then he called, ‚ÄúHold on kid, I want to speak to you!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I turned around and he said, ‚ÄúSay kid, don‚Äôt get scared.</Sentence> <Sentence>Aren‚Äôt you
the little girl that poured tea for us today at the Stopping House?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I hesitated.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did pour tea for men, once at a stopping house, but
that was a long time ago, it seemed like a month.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes, I did,‚Äù I said and waited to see what he wanted.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now, I would
know the worst.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe mother was right, maybe he thought I was a bold
hussy and he could speak to me any way he liked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>While this was flashing through my mind, the man was saying:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI just thought it was you when I saw you go out and I came after you.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It‚Äôs late for a little girl to be out alone and there are lots of
drunk men around, you might get a scare.</Sentence> <Sentence>Can I take you, wherever you
want to go?</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd be glad to.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I thanked him and told him where we were staying.</Sentence> <Sentence>He didn‚Äôt ask me how
I came to be at the Music Hall and I did not volunteer the
information.</Sentence>

<Sentence>As we walked along in the darkness he said, ‚ÄúI liked the way you
jumped up and gave a hand today, at the Stopping House.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was just a
little thing but it showed something of your disposition.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMother thinks I am too free in my ways,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI do things before
I think, but I can‚Äôt see any harm in being friendly, I like people who
are friendly with me, like you are now.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúKeep on being friendly, kid,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt works both ways.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was really very grateful to him though I did not know how to say it,
and when we said goodnight in the circle of light that came through
the front window of the Farmer‚Äôs Home, I got a good look at him, but I
never saw him again, and never knew who he was.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next morning when we went down to breakfast, I saw Bertha making
signs at me to come out.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had swung the door out just a little.</Sentence> <Sentence>So
I went out to see what she had to say.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSay, I am sorry about last night.</Sentence> <Sentence>Does your mother know?</Sentence> <Sentence>Oh, that‚Äôs
good, well you know, Fred would have me stay and dance and I only get
to see him in the evening and sometimes not then.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was going to get
him to have a dance with you.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know it would have pleased you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI do not dance at public dance-halls,‚Äù I said with dignity, ‚ÄúI am
quite too young for that.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My voice sounded much more like my mother‚Äôs than my own.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hardly knew
it.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúFred never wants to dance with any one but me,‚Äù Bertha went on
rapturously, ‚Äúbut he would have done it, if I said so.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Did you
notice how very handsome he is?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI did not!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I said truthfully.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh yes,‚Äù she said happily, ‚Äúhe is remarkably handsome of the Black
Hawk type.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I often wonder what he sees in me.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remembered the incident of the slender roll of bills, that changed
hands outside the door, and I wondered too.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI had not seen him for three days, until last night, and I was
worried.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are plenty of women just ready to entice a handsome man
away.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he‚Äôs just the same dear old Fred.</Sentence> <Sentence>O, I am so much happier
now, you wouldn‚Äôt believe.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Her pallid face actually glowed.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou see we are almost engaged.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
has given me more than one hint that he is going to propose.</Sentence> <Sentence>We have
been keeping company for nearly a year now, and for the last month,
we‚Äôve been keeping close company.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a fine shading of meaning there, but it was lost on me.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty nice for a girl to have a gentleman to take her around,
for no nice girl goes out alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would soon be talked about, if
she did.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Here it was again from Bertha and again I rebelled against it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would
go out alone, any time I wanted to!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bertha‚Äôs draggled face, with her drooping wisps of hair, giving me
that pathetic drowned look, kindled a sudden rage in me.</Sentence> <Sentence>What fools
women were!</Sentence> <Sentence>How terribly dependent on men; and how pleased when some
man, no matter how worthless, took notice of them!</Sentence> <Sentence>Bertha was rambling
on.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI often wonder what he sees in me, I am too pale to be considered
really pretty, but Fred seems to depend on me some way, and you should
see how he bosses me around.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes you‚Äôd think we were really
married.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was simpering now and looked more horrible than ever.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt
think of anything to say but I was heart sorry for her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew, young
as I was, that Bertha was a tragedy.</Sentence> <Sentence>The kitchen looked gray and
greasy in the bright morning light.</Sentence> <Sentence>The table was full of dirty
dishes.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was nothing ahead for her but monotonous work.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
seemed very old to me, as I looked at her and I knew that Fred would
take her money and break her heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to do something about it!</Sentence>
<Sentence>Just then the cook shouted at her to stop ‚Äúchewin‚Äô the rag and see who
was poundin‚Äô the table inside, and who did she think she was anyway?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went back to the dining room.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack joined us before we were through breakfast in fine humor.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
been up early, hitched up the team, and sold his wheat.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sixty bushels
at seventy-five cents a bushel.</Sentence> <Sentence>He counted out the money on the table
and gave it to mother.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was very much pleased with him and praised him for his success in
getting the load sold.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought it was very smart of him too.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We waited until he had finished his breakfast, so we could all go
together to do our buying.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMother, I got you a bottle of medicine last night,‚Äù Jack said as he
ate his porridge.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWas it swamp root?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked, with a sudden fear.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I knew what
would happen.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had presented my bottle as soon as she was awake.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes, how do you know, it‚Äôs a new thing.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNellie got me one too,‚Äù mother said; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good children to be
spending your money on me, but I don‚Äôt need the two bottles, so Nellie
can take her‚Äôs back and get her money.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I said, hot for battle.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúA sale is a sale, I would
have no reason for taking it back.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou can tell him your brother bought one too, that‚Äôs all you need to
say.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Seeing a storm about to rise, mother implored me to be quiet.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou can
do it more easily than Johnny, a young man can‚Äôt very well seem to
change his mind, but it‚Äôs different with a little girl like you, and
the man who sold you the bottle, wouldn‚Äôt think anything of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now
don‚Äôt be so headstrong, I‚Äôll go with you,‚ÄîI‚Äôll tell him how it
happened.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhy not use both bottles,‚Äù Jack said, ‚ÄúI know how she feels about not
wanting to take it back.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo, one bottle is enough to see if it is any good and it won‚Äôt hurt
her to take it back, I don‚Äôt see why she is so stubborn about it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was the old trouble, with the old solution.</Sentence> <Sentence>Always I was the one
who was expected to give in.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we went up to our room to get our things on, to go out, I sneaked
down the stairs with my bottle of Swamp Root and gave it to Bertha.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
anyone in the world needed it, she did; ‚Äúlustre to the eye‚Äîroses to
the cheek.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I was sorry to see my dollar go this way, but at least the
matter was settled.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Neither mother or Jack knew what I had done with the bottle, so we
started out for one big day in good humor.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had pictured this
shopping expedition many times, and I didn‚Äôt want anything to spoil
it; I hoped mother would forget about it, and to that end, kept up an
animated flow of conversation regarding our purchases.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll buy all the men‚Äôs things first,‚Äù mother said, ‚ÄúI want shirts
for your father and cloth to make him a pair of pants, a suit for
George and Johnny, and yarn for socks .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>overalls for the hired
man.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She had her list written out and consulted it often, as we went from
side to side of the big store.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our parcels were put in a big wooden
box and would be left in the store until we were leaving the next
morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was going to get the makings of a Sunday dress, but as the piles of
parcels grew, I had a momentary fear that there might be no money left
to buy it.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I put that aside as an unworthy thought.</Sentence> <Sentence>What my mother
promised, she fulfilled, whether of good or evil; I never knew her to
break her word so I gave myself up to the enjoyment of the day.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt forget your own dress,‚Äù I said to her, in a sudden warm feeling
of loyalty to her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sorry I had talked back to her about the
medicine.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could have been more tactful.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll see how the money lasts,‚Äù‚Äîshe answered, looking at her list
with her brows drawn down.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter much about me, I do not have to go out and the rest
of you do.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The dress goods occupied one side of the store and the rolls of cloth
were arranged diagonally on the deep shelves, so that not only the
ends but six inches of the side of the roll could be seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>The colors
were radiant, such reds and greens, a lovely greenish blue, called
electric blue.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wished we could get that color for Hannah for it was
just like her eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Seal brown was what Lizzie looked best in, to set
off her hair and eyes and she was going to have a cashmere dress of
it, trimmed with velvet of the same shade.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The clerks were very attentive and carried a chair for mother to sit
on as we went around the store.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can‚Äôt remember that there were any
saleswomen; there were many shoppers in the store and mother met one
of the women who had been tenting near us on the bank of the
Assiniboine.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had gone to <Location>Grand Valley</Location> and started a boarding house
but the town was moved to Brandon, so they were trying to farm, but
she hated it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had always lived in a town.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had lost little Lucy
who was the baby when we saw them in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, but she was buying
white flannel and I knew what that meant.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought she ought to be
glad, but she wasn‚Äôt.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had lost her teeth and looked like an old
woman.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was deeply sorry and kept telling her not to cry.</Sentence> <Sentence>No
doubt the worst was over .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>but, with the callousness of youth, I
wanted to get rid of her‚Äîwe should get on with our buying.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The streets were full of men and sleighs.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had never seen so many
people.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered where they came from.</Sentence> <Sentence>Oxen with their hair standing
up, with the cold, like plush, stood patiently waiting, but the poor
horses with their shorter hair and some of them unblanketed, pulled on
their halters and blew their breath out in clouds of vapor.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In front of the Kelly House we saw three teams without blankets as we
passed, and when we came back to the hotel for noon they were still
there shivering and pawing the snow.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother went in and spoke to the
man at the desk about them, and he promised to look up the owners.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThey are somewhere in the House,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôll get them.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is
a shame to leave their horses like this.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLook in the bar,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the likeliest place to find
the sort of men who would leave their horses to freeze.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He promised again.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we came out we noticed there were blankets in the sleigh and Jack
put them on the horses.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother‚Äôs indignation flamed still higher, ‚Äúthink of that‚Äîand yet we
call horses brutes.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs what liquor does to a man,‚Äîmakes him forget
that someone is depending on him and many a man has forgotten his wife
and family, just the same way.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night I did not get out with Bertha, for I had to go to bed
early, on account of the early start, which we must make.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was very
happy over our purchases.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were moccasins for everyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mine had
a design in blue and red beads with red duffel to line them with; wool
to knit stockings; a dress pattern for Lizzie; a new lamp, the biggest
one I had ever seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>It would have red flannel in its bowl when it was
set up.</Sentence> <Sentence>Writing paper and an envelope of pen points, 292‚Äôs, and some
stubs for Will, who wrote with his pen held between his little finger
and the one next to it, in a very dashing way, which I would have
gladly copied if I could.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were dresses for the three girls, and
mine was the color I loved, a crimson cashmere and the buttons were
clouded pearl.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was a very careful buyer and knew that the best quality is the
cheapest in the end.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had a great love for good materials.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúEven if
your dress is old and patched,‚Äù she would say, ‚Äúyou can still have
pride in it, if it is of good material.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was only one regret when we got home and that was that she had
bought nothing for herself.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she made very light of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>However,
the first load of grain that George took in, he bought her a dress
length of Henrietta cloth, with passementerie trimmings, out of his
own money.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That morning when we drove out of Brandon, with the sleigh crunching
the newly fallen snow and the east reddening behind the <Location>Sand Hills</Location>,
toothed with pines along the top, I was in a high state of
exhilaration, and even on good terms with Jack, and prepared to admit
he was a very smart boy for seventeen.</Sentence> <Sentence>A few rags of clouds idled
above the <Location>Sand Hills</Location> to the east, holding the color of the sunrise.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The great yellow Court House with pale lights shining in half a dozen
upper windows, threw its blue shadow over us as we passed and a
heavier shadow on my elation, for I knew there was a man in a cell
there who was going to be hanged the day after Christmas.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had come
home drunk and shot his wife, while she was ironing and he was sorry
for doing it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told the Judge he didn‚Äôt know why he had done it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
thought of him for many miles, and prayed that he might find peace for
his soul, and go into his Maker‚Äôs presence unafraid.</Sentence> <Sentence>God would
understand better than the Judge, and do whatever should be done for
him, when he passed over.</Sentence> <Sentence>The liquor business was a curse on people
and I had a guilty feeling about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were all to blame someway, but
this poor fellow was the one who had to take the punishment.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
eyelashes began to freeze down, so I knew I had to stop thinking about
him, and asked Jack to let me get out and run behind for a while; I
said my feet were getting cold.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XX‚ÄîChristmas Day</Sentence>


<Sentence>Christmas was a jolly time that year.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had spruce boughs, brought
from the Sandhills, across the doors and windows, and streamers of red
tissue paper and red and green balls, made from tissue paper cut in
circles, folded and sewed together.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Lundy had showed Hannah how
to make these, when Hannah had stayed with her in the summer holidays.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mr. and Mrs. Lundy had a store about a mile east of Millford.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember particularly the apple-jelly tarts that we had at Christmas
and how delicious they were.</Sentence> <Sentence>The apple-jelly was bright red in color,
for snow apples were now sold in Mr. Lundy‚Äôs store and mother had used
only the parings and cores for the jelly, and the other part was made
into apple sauce.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. and Mrs. Frank Burnett, Nina and Frankie were
our guests that year.</Sentence> <Sentence>A long table was set and no one had to wait for
the second table.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Burnett was a pretty woman with hazel eyes and a fair skin and
the most beautiful clothes I had ever seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had a dolman of smoke
gray brocaded velvet and a black grosgrain silk dress with bugle
trimming, and a gold bar brooch set with pearls, and earrings to
match.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was the daughter of a well-known <Location>Montreal</Location> family and must
have found the life she was now living a sad contrast to her life in
the city.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she made light of the hardships of the prairie.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIf only
we could keep the bread from freezing‚Äù she complained once.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI cannot
make very good bread anyway, but it‚Äôs worse when it freezes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even when
I wrap it in Frank‚Äôs fur coat, it freezes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I was not old enough to
fully appreciate her gallantry of spirit but when I heard her singing
to her children, ‚ÄúGrandpa will come with the Wo-Wo and take us away
from the cold,‚Äù I knew she was singing it to keep up her own spirits
too.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Christmas Day has always been flavored to me with the pound cake and
apple-jelly tarts of those first days in <Location>Manitoba</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The front-room always got a new coat of white-wash on the log walls at
Christmas, and everything was scoured as white as sand or soap could
make it.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hand-knit lace curtains, brought from <Location>Ontario</Location>, were
washed and starched and stretched on home-made frames, so they would
hang straight and reach the floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Short curtains were considered
slightly indecent.</Sentence> <Sentence>The two long widths of rag carpet in bright stripes
with orange warp were brought out and laid on the white floor, with
the good mats, one hooked and one braided.</Sentence> <Sentence>The home-made lounge had a
covering of dark maroon canton flannel and was well supplied with
patch work cushions, crazy pattern of silks and satins and two log
cabins, one made of ‚Äústuff pieces‚Äù, the other one of prints.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
were two book-cases made with spools, painted black, and set with
shelves and a ‚Äúwhat-not‚Äù of five shelves, on which stood china
ornaments, a shell box, with a green plush pincushion on the top,
apples filled with cloves, and cups and saucers, (honorably retired
from active service because of cracks, or missing handles, but with
these defects tactfully concealed in the way they were placed),
colored glass mugs, and on the top, a bouquet of prairie grasses, set
in a frosted glass vase, a lace pattern on deep blue.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember it
well, for I broke it years later, when bouncing a ball, on the floor.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Who would have thought a yarn ball would bounce so high?</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the weather got cold, the kitchen stove had to be brought into
the big room, and it was a family grief when this change had to be
made.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the weather did not come down too hard, the stove was kept
out until after Christmas.</Sentence> <Sentence>Later when the storm doors and windows were
added, and a bigger heater bought, a fine big barrel of a stove, with
a row of mica windows around its middle, through which the coals
glowed with all the colors of a sunset, the kitchen stove remained in
the kitchen all winter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But even when the kitchen stove was in the middle of the big room,
there was a cheerful roominess about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>The woodbox papered with
pictures of the Ice Palace, in <Location>Montreal</Location>, (_Family Herald Supplement_)
when covered with two boards over which a quilt was spread made a nice
warm seat and when we got the hanging lamp from Brandon, with a pale
pink shade, on which a brown deer poised for a leap across a chasm,
through which a green stream dashed in foam on the rocks, the effect
was magical and in the pink light the white-washed walls were softened
into alabaster.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had two new pictures now, enlarged photographs of father and mother
in heavy oak frames with a gilt edge, done by a travelling artist, who
drove a team of mules and carried a few lines of tinware.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every family
in the neighborhood had taken advantage of his easy plan to secure a
lasting work of art.</Sentence> <Sentence>You paid only for the frame and received the
picture entirely free though this offer might be withdrawn any minute
for he was doing this merely to get his work known.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said there was
no nicer way to give one‚Äôs parents a pleasant surprise, and the
pictures would be delivered in time for Christmas.</Sentence> <Sentence>When they came, we
all had a surprise.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had thought that the seven dollars and
thirty-five cents paid for both frames but we were wrong.</Sentence> <Sentence>Each one
cost that amount and even at that the artist was losing money.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
pictures were accepted and hung on the log walls, and in the
declivities behind them were kept tissue paper patterns, newspaper
clippings, and other semi-precious documents, thus relieving the
congestion in the real archives, lodged in the lower regions of the
clock, where notes, grain-tickets, tax receipts were kept.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After the Christmas dinner of turkey and plum pudding, the men sat and
talked of the trouble <Location>Louis</Location> Riel was causing.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had come back from
<Location>Montana</Location>, where he had been teaching school and was now in
<Location>Saskatchewan</Location>, stirring up the half-breeds and Indians and inciting
them to make raids on the white settlers.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they arrest him now, and get him safely in jail before
someone is killed?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Mother was greatly disturbed over the situation.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthinking of the poor women there,
frightened to go to sleep at night.</Sentence> <Sentence>They say he has given guns to the
Indians and there will be another massacre like there was in
<Location>Minnesota</Location>.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Frank Burnett was indignant that the Government had not sent an armed
force, just as soon as the trouble began.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúUniforms would settle the trouble,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe red coats and the
flash of steel, a few guns fired and the half-breeds and Indians would
know there was law in the country.</Sentence> <Sentence>Riel should be hanged anyway for
the murder of Thos.</Sentence> <Sentence>Scott.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to talk.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Schultz had told us about it in school.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
half-breeds and Indians had a grievance, a real one.</Sentence> <Sentence>The settlers were
crowding in on them, their land was being surveyed over again, and
divided into squares like ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had long narrow lots, as they had
along the Red and Assiniboine, so they could live side by side, and
now a new arrangement of land was being made and they were afraid
their land was going to be taken from them.</Sentence> <Sentence>When they sent letters to
<Location>Ottawa</Location>, they got no replies.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew how they felt.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had often asked for explanations and got the
prescribed 19th century dusty answer, ‚Äúbecause I say so‚Äîthat‚Äôs all the
reason you need‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>How I hated it!</Sentence> <Sentence>And how unfair I felt it to be!</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Government officials were treating the Indians the same way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew the government was to blame but I would not be allowed to say
it, and if I did get it said, I might get Mr. Schultz into trouble.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother would feel he was undermining our respect for authority.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But much to my delight, Hannah came forward and defended the half
breeds.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah was always listened to when she spoke.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had what I
lacked, a quiet and dignified way of expression.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe country belonged to the Indians and half-breeds,‚Äù she said in her
even voice.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe must not forget that.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know they have made little use
of it and must yield it to white settlers, in time, but there‚Äôs enough
territory for everyone if it is handled right, and they could be
easily appeased and satisfied.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She told about the new survey, about the delay in getting the patents
out for the land the half-breeds had proved-up on, about the slaughter
of the buffalo, the Indians‚Äô source of food, and clothing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah was fifteen then, with a fine presence, fair skin, a round
face, and fine large greenish-blue eyes, and abundant bright brown
hair, inclined to curl.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had been wiping dishes behind the stove
and came out with a plate in one hand, and a flour-sack tea towel in
the other.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her face was flushed and her eyes bright and to me she
looked like Joan of Arc.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was very proud of her, but I knew there was
a sudden tightening of the atmosphere.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even now, men do not like to be
taught by women, but at that time for a girl of fifteen to presume to
have an opinion, was against all tradition.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, Hannah had a
prestige all her own.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She went on.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt is not the Catholic church, and it is not Louis Riel,
who is causing the trouble‚Äîit is the stupidity of the Government at
<Location>Ottawa</Location>, and if settlers are killed by the Indians theirs will be the
guilt.</Sentence> <Sentence>A few words of explanation, a few concessions and peace could
be restored.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMy God!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù exclaimed Frank Burnett in real concern, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs hot talk,
Hannah, you‚Äôve said enough to hang you in some countries.</Sentence> <Sentence>If you were
in <Location>Russia</Location>, you would be shot for a Nihilist, my girl.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My mother was too much amazed to speak.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had said half of what
Hannah had, she would know what to do with me, but Hannah, quiet,
dignified Hannah, the image of her own mother, Margaret Fullerton
McCurdy, could not be sent upstairs in disgrace.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah went on wiping the dishes with great composure.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had said
what she wanted to say and now withdrew from the conversation.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
hearers had heard the truth, and they could take it or leave it.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Responsibility had passed from her to them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Burnett continued the argument.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI am afraid there is bad work
going on at Northfield School,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI gather that is where
Hannah gets her ideas.</Sentence> <Sentence>This man Schultz is a German; he has no love
for British institutions and is using his position as a teacher to
undermine the children‚Äôs respect for authority.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôll have to look
into this.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôll have to call a meeting of the trustees.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My heart stood still.</Sentence> <Sentence>Had we involved our teacher in some trouble that
might lead to his losing his job?</Sentence>

<Sentence>They all began to talk; and I could feel a hostile tide of opinion
gathering and sweeping ahead of it all good sense and reason and it
seemed to me I would have to speak, no matter what happened.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will
would listen to me anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went over and stood before him.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWill,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI want to talk, make them keep quiet.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNellie has something on her mind,‚Äù Will called out in his good
humored way.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt is not often this poor tongue-tied child wants to
talk, and she should get her chance on Christmas day, of all times.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother rose up to protest, but Will waved her back.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLet the kid talk,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútalk won‚Äôt hurt anyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs the things
we don‚Äôt say that hurt us, I know.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then came the ordeal, when the silence fell on the room.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have faced
audiences who were hostile since then and encountered unfriendly
glances, but the antagonism here was more terrible, being directed,
not as much against what I had to say, as against the fact that I
dared to say anything.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I addressed Will, as people air their views in letters addressed to
the Editor.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe Government is like the Machine Company, Will,‚Äù I
said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe half-breeds are dissatisfied with the way they are treated,
they are afraid they are going to be put off their farms, just as we
were afraid when the tongue of the binder broke, and we saw we were
going to lose our crop.</Sentence> <Sentence>The half-breeds have written letters, and sent
people to see the Government and asked them to send out someone to
straighten out their troubles, just as you, Will, wrote letters to the
Company and asked them to send an expert, who would put the binder in
good shape.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Government won‚Äôt answer the half-breeds, won‚Äôt notice
them, won‚Äôt talk to them‚Äîand the only word they send them is a saucy
word‚Äî‚Äòwhat we will send you will be an army; we‚Äôll put you in your
place.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô Just as the Machine Company wrote to us a saucy letter saying
that it was our own fault if the binders broke, and they couldn‚Äôt
supply us with brains.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs the same spirit.</Sentence> <Sentence>We should understand how
the half-breeds feel.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs all I want to say,‚Äù and before anyone
could say a word, I left the room, glad to get away.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah came out soon after and we went upstairs and took counsel
together.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said to me in her comforting way, ‚ÄúMr.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Schultz is safely away at Pelican Lake and won‚Äôt be back for two
weeks.</Sentence> <Sentence>Two weeks is quite a long time‚Äîthey‚Äôll cool off before that,
father said there was a lot of truth in what we said, but they talked
him down.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat did Will say?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked anxiously.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh, Will just laughed about us and said we had put the case well, but
mother thinks we are in the same class as Guy Fawkes who put the stick
of dynamite under the House of Parliament, and she says she will go to
the trustees herself, if no one else will.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I had something to worry over.</Sentence> <Sentence>I begged her to tell me how this
would be prevented.</Sentence> <Sentence>She shook her head, but her coolness comforted me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe Lord will provide‚Äù, she said airily, ‚ÄúListen!</Sentence> <Sentence>the dogs are
barking!</Sentence> <Sentence>Someone is coming.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She thawed an eye-hole in the frozen window and looked out.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúPeople
from Millford‚Äù, she called back to me cheerfully, ‚Äúcheer up, brother
Ridley‚Äîwe won‚Äôt be shot today.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Visitors were never more welcome to us than they were at that moment,
for we knew that mother would rise to the occasion and the subject
would be dropped for the day, at least.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was no wonder people liked to come to our house, for mother was
never happier than when she was pouring a cup of tea, and serving a
visitor with some of her own good cooking.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When she would fall into low spirits, the first few years we were in
the country and sit drooping and sad under the pall of loneliness that
wrapped us around for many months in the year, Hannah and I used to
look eagerly across the waste of snow, hoping we would see someone
coming.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes we would climb to the top of the stable to get a
wider view; and the one on the ground would solemnly ask the one who
had gone aloft, ‚ÄúSister Ann, Sister Ann, do you see anybody coming?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Once when I was on the ground and asked the question of Hannah, who
was balancing herself on the ridge pole of the stable, she held her
two arms up to get the breeze and solemnly replied.</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúI see the snow drifting,
    And feel the wind shifting,
  And e‚Äôer the sun is higher
    A traveller draweth nigher,
  So let our gloom be lifting
    Hence, minion, mend the fire!</Sentence>
  <Sentence>And tell your angel mother
    To cease from idle weeping
  And let the tea be steeping.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I never knew whether Hannah made up her rhymes carefully beforehand or
like Alan-Bane in the Lady of the Lake, had the gift of minstrelsy.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There was no way of finding out either.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I can‚Äôt remember whether I went down stairs or not that day.</Sentence> <Sentence>For if my
mother said she would go to the trustees, she would.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had a sense
of duty that would drive her through fire and water.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew she was
wrong this time and that hurt me, for I loved my mother and understood
the working of her mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was above all things, loyal to her own.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Her family, her relatives, her country.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was critical of us, and
set forth our faults in plain language, for she was anxious to make us
what she thought we ought to be, but if anyone else found fault with
us, she would spring to our defence, without question.</Sentence> <Sentence>She saw nothing
but virtue in her own relatives or at least admitted nothing but
virtue and had a fine scorn for men or women who criticized their
husbands or wives to outsiders, or slandered any member of their own
family connection.</Sentence> <Sentence>Family loyalty was woven into her life‚Äôs pattern.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs an ill bird that fouls its own nest‚Äù, was her comment when
anyone tried to tell her their family troubles.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So it was with her country.</Sentence> <Sentence><Location>Great Britain</Location> was the greatest and best
and most God-fearing country in the world, and Queen Victoria was the
hand-maiden of the Lord.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had seen her once in her widow‚Äôs
mourning, driving in an open carriage through the streets of <Location>Dundee</Location>
and loved her with a passionate devotion.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So she would be very high-minded in her visit to the trustees, when
she went to complain of Mr. Schultz‚Äô teaching, and she might even come
to the school and reprimand Mr. Schultz before us all.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would be
very polite with her, for I know he had a high regard for her, but the
scene would be too terrible to think of.</Sentence> <Sentence>She wouldn‚Äôt reason, or
listen to reason, for her mind was made up.</Sentence> <Sentence>And it would end in a high
note of tragedy for she would walk out with her head up, calling on
Hannah and me to follow!</Sentence>

<Sentence>And what would we do?</Sentence> <Sentence>Knowing her to be wrong?</Sentence>

<Sentence>And yet how can anyone desert their mother!</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew then what Christ
meant when he said that is just what you may have to do if you swear
allegiance to the truth.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I knew I wasn‚Äôt ready for this.</Sentence>

<Sentence>If ever I prayed in my life, I prayed then that the decision would not
have to be made, that somehow it would not come to this!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother had had one serious illness since we came to <Location>Manitoba</Location>, an
illness that came on suddenly, almost like a ‚Äústroke‚Äù and I was
fearful that the excitement of a visit to the school might bring a
repetition, and this dark and stifling fear was on me day and night
during the holidays that year, and even when sleigh riding down the
steep bank of the creek north of the house, when Hannah and I played
out each fine day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loved the swift rush of the runners over the hard
drifts and the impact of cold air on my face, with an occasional spill
at the bottom when the sleigh shot on without us, I loved it for it
made me, for one brief moment, forget.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXI‚ÄîA Visit From the Teacher</Sentence>


<Sentence>When school began in January I knew we were skating on thin ice, the
break might come any day and I was so worried over it I could not
sleep or eat.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was sure I was growing too fast and saw to it
that I drank a quart of milk each day, which had no effect on me,
except to keep me from liking milk all my life.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sure she was
going to carry out her threat of visiting the school for I never knew
mother to break her word.</Sentence> <Sentence>That was another motif in her life‚Äôs
pattern.</Sentence> <Sentence>How I wished she were less conscientious, though I remembered
how I gloried in the story of her going to the Settlement School on
the Common, where Will attended when he was a little boy, before the
Public schools came in <Location>Ontario</Location> and reprimanding the teacher, a bad
tempered old soldier, for his cruelty to another boy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will had come
home in tears because of the unmerciful beating given to his little
friend, an orphan boy, who lived with his uncle, and mother had gone
in all haste to the log school with fire in her eye and put the fear
of death into the brutal teacher.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought this was a very fine thing
for her to do, and I knew she was quite as conscientious now in her
intention of protesting against what she thought was false teaching at
Northfield.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My general listlessness and lack of appetite diverted her mind and I
tried to feel that I was a martyr in the cause of freedom, but I
couldn‚Äôt get any sensation from my state of mind, but a sort of dull
despair, and when I was kept home from school, the sorrows of life
overflowed my young soul.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew Hannah had a better philosophy of life than I had and vainly
tried to lay hold on it.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt worry over anything before it happens and don‚Äôt worry then.</Sentence> <Sentence>Let
things happen‚Äîif they must, you can‚Äôt stop them anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre foolish
to be losing your time and energy when you should be studying.</Sentence> <Sentence>Work so
hard, you can‚Äôt think.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Looking back at it, I wonder what power nineteenth century parents had
over their children and how did they hold it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was not a particularly
meek young person, but I could not stand up to my mother, even knowing
that she was wrong.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But one day deliverance came as easily as a sunbeam comes in at a
window.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was out tying in the cows and doing up the evening chores,
for the three boys were away to Brandon with loads of wheat, when I
saw Hannah coming down the snowy road, with Bert Ingram and Mr.
Schultz.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if Mr. Schultz was coming in.</Sentence> <Sentence>Had he heard that
mother was on the war path, and had come over to see her?</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew she
would be polite to him, if he came in‚Äîthat was another part of her
pattern.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äî‚ÄúLet it never be said that you were ill-mannered in your own
house.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I stayed out in the stable until I was all but frozen.</Sentence> <Sentence>When at
last I went in, what a sight met my eyes!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz sat beside the stove, in the big rocking chair, drinking a
steaming cup of beef-broth.</Sentence> <Sentence>He greeted me affectionately.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI came over
to see you, Nellie‚Äù, he said, with his ready smile.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHannah tells me
you are not feeling well and I am a bit under the weather myself, so I
came over to get a bit of your mother‚Äôs good nursing too.</Sentence> <Sentence>I just
couldn‚Äôt go back to a cold house tonight and frozen bread.</Sentence> <Sentence>Newt
Thompson is hauling out wheat, too.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz lived with Newton Thompson on the farm southwest of us.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They did their own cooking.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIf you are not feeling better tomorrow morning‚Äù, mother said,
spreading a blanket over his knees, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep you in bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah can
look after the school for you very well and a day in bed will break
your cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah put the black pot full of coals upstairs in the
boys‚Äô room‚Äîit will take the chill off the air.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had a wonderful evening under the hanging lamp with its fringe of
crystal beads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After a hot dinner and a dose of mother‚Äôs cough syrup of honey, butter
and vinegar, Mr. Schultz declared himself to be on the highway of
recovery.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said he did not believe he would need the foot-bath of
mustard water and the reason for his reluctance came out later.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
holes in his socks, and did not want to let that be known ‚ÄúMaggie
would kill me if she knew I was going around like this‚Äù, he laughed.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúMaggie‚Äù, was Mrs. Schultz who lived on their homestead near Pelican
Lake.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then mother decided that he must have a new pair of socks and she
would finish a pair she had on the needles.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThis is the last of my
yarn‚Äù, she said wistfully, ‚Äúmy own carding and spinning and I will be
glad to have you take them.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI will be proud to own them‚Äù, he said as he thanked her warmly.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúProud indeed, but I will not let them be worn out, for they are a
symbol of an era in our history that is passing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hand work is being
superseded by machinery, and the fine creative household arts will be
forgotten.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She tossed him the finished one, as she set to work to take off the
toe of its mate and he examined it admiringly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWomen are very
resourceful‚Äù, he said, as he watched her bringing the other one to
completion.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThey have seized all the resources at their hands and
fashioned them to human needs, with great cleverness.</Sentence> <Sentence>Can you knit?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
he asked me suddenly.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNot very well‚Äù, I confessed‚Äî‚ÄúI am afraid I do not like it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLearn all you can from your mother, Nellie,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôll be
proud of her skill when you grow up, you‚Äôll be glad to boast of it.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Just think of what these socks mean.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wool on a sheep‚Äôs back, converted
into socks on a man‚Äôs feet, and all done by one pair of skillful
hands.</Sentence> <Sentence>And you didn‚Äôt bring your spinning wheel or loom, Mrs. Mooney?</Sentence>
<Sentence>Too bad, they would be great treasures in forty years or less.</Sentence> <Sentence>You
would be asked to loan them for art exhibits and it would be a great
source of interest for the young women to see how you made cloth, and
set the patterns.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why didn‚Äôt you bring them?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he asked, after a pause.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother hesitated‚Äîit was a tender subject.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI wanted to‚Äù, she said,
‚Äúfor I loved doing these things, and never was happier than when I set
the shuttle in the loom, but Will was against it‚Äîhe said we were
getting away from all this.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know how the young people feel too,
though it hurts me to see it.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are a little bit ashamed of
home-made stuff.</Sentence> <Sentence>They want machine-made clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are dressier and
more the style.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hand-made cloth will wear ten times as long, but
that‚Äôs not what they want.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It was a kindness too, on Willie‚Äôs
part‚Äîhe knew I had plenty to do without weaving, but weaving was not
work‚Äîit was my pleasure‚Äîbecause.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBecause you were creating something‚Äù, Mr. Schultz finished for her,
‚Äúsomething beautiful as well as useful.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She nodded her head, and went on with her knitting in silence.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The conversation turned to the trouble in the <Location>North West</Location>, but
fortunately mother was busy counting stitches as she finished the
sock, and so said nothing.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt was too bad the half-breeds sent for Riel,‚Äù Mr. Schultz said, ‚Äúhe
was safely away in <Location>Montana</Location>, teaching school and doing very well, for
he‚Äôs well fitted for teaching.</Sentence> <Sentence>But in their distress they turned to
him, and asked him, coaxed him to come.</Sentence> <Sentence>He can talk well, and write
well, and they knew he is sincere.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the Government had had the good
sense to send, out a man who would explain away their troubles, they
would have never thought of Riel.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve heard him speak many times, and
talked to him and I believe he is sincere, but he is flighty, and
emotional, and fanatical.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sincerity may be a curse to people, when
there is not good judgment to guide it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Look at Bloody Mary, she was
certainly sincere, but that sincerity took the form of killing
Protestants.</Sentence> <Sentence>She believed she was doing them a good turn, killing
their bodies, and thus saving their souls from heresy.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He told us about the first Rebellion in 1870.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had heard it
discussed in Kildonan, where he had taught before he came to us.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Kildonan being near to <Location>Winnipeg</Location> was in the affected area, and the
events of 1870 were fresh in the minds of the people there.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe trouble was stirred up largely because of the overbearing ways of
some of the government‚Äôs agents,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThey belittled the
half-breeds, sneered at them, they were ‚Äòdirty half-breeds.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô Letters
were written back to the papers in <Location>Toronto</Location> making fun of the natives,
by some members of the Snow Commission, who had been sent out to
investigate conditions.</Sentence> <Sentence>Insulting letters, smart-aleck letters, the
writers of which did not think the half-breeds would ever see them,
but the printed page has wings.</Sentence> <Sentence>Good manners would have saved the
whole situation, just as good manners will hold a home together and
bad manners can destroy a home.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe ill-feeling between <Location>England</Location> and <Location>Scotland</Location> was kept alive the same
way.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Words, words‚Äîthe tongue is an unruly member.</Sentence> <Sentence>You know what
the Bible says ‚Äòabout a soft answer turning away wrath‚Äô.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It
does.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He turned to my father.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúStrange isn‚Äôt it, Mr. Mooney,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat after more than
eighteen hundred years of Christian teaching, there is so little of
real Christianity in the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>Governments still think a bullet is
the best argument.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt will come,‚Äù father said slowly, ‚Äúbut we all have to work for
it‚Äîline upon line precept upon precept, here a little and there a
little, and you are doing something yourself, I can see.</Sentence> <Sentence>Get the minds
of children set in the right mould and in one generation the world
could be changed.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the glamorous happiness of that evening.</Sentence> <Sentence>My burden was
gone, I was no longer afraid.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father liked a bowl of gruel before going to bed‚Äîit warmed the marrow
in his bones he said.</Sentence> <Sentence>That night, the black pot of oatmeal porridge
was put on early, and simmered on the back of the stove, while we
talked, and at ten o‚Äôclock we all had a bowl of gruel, flavored with
nutmeg, and piping hot.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz declared he was going to institute this fine custom at
once, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôll have to show me how you do it,‚Äù he said to mother.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs a trick in this, I never tasted gruel like this.</Sentence> <Sentence>The kind of
gruel the boys in Squeers‚Äô School got was described by Dickens as
‚Äòdiluted pincushions‚Äô, and I always thought that was about what it was
everywhere.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve learned something tonight.</Sentence> <Sentence>This is delicious.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The evening ended on a high note.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was very proud of my family which
is surely one of the most satisfying emotions a child can have.</Sentence> <Sentence>That
night I noticed for the first time, that nutmeg is a sweet,
significant, honest, homely flavor, and to this day, it brings back
soothing memories.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is the incense that rises from the happy hearths
of contented people, and has in it the solidity of the soil, the
blessing of the hour of rest, the essence of goodwill and
neighborliness, Nutmeg!</Sentence> <Sentence>I rank it with lilacs after rain, and wild
rose leaves pressed in the pages of an old school book!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went to school the next day feeling as well as I ever did in my
life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After Mr. Schultz&apos;s goodwill visit, life settled into a pleasant
round.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap had quite recovered and grown to be a bigger dog than he
had been before, and now, almost the size of his <Location>Newfoundland</Location>
ancestor, he was the finest sleigh-dog in the neighborhood.</Sentence>

<Sentence>John Rae, a neighbor, for whom Mother baked bread, had made me a
little hand sleigh with steel-shod runners, and painted a dazzling
red, with my initials in black paint, on the middle of the top, and I
had an elaborate harness for Nap, made by myself from straps and snaps
taken from old horse harness.</Sentence> <Sentence>Harness making occupied a large place in
my life at this time, and I was quite handy with a canvas needle,
linen thread, bees wax and binding twine; and when some one gave me a
string of shining bells to buckle around Nap‚Äôs ample chest, I felt I
had a very creditable turn-out.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have always felt that a real good
harness-maker was lost to the world when I began to do other things.</Sentence>

<Sentence>With this fine equipment, I carried on a very nice freighting business
from Millford each Saturday morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I rode going to Millford with my moccasined feet stuck under the cross
bar of the sleigh to hold me on, as Nap galloped over the drifts.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
coming home, with a load of groceries tightly roped on the sleigh I
walked behind and carried the mail in my leather book-bag slung over
my shoulder.</Sentence> <Sentence>Always there was the _Family Herald_, with its great
wealth of reading, from Family Remedies and the Etiquette Department
to the continued story and the Irish News for father.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Remembering his delight and interest in the pathetically bare little
columns, given each week, a sorrow comes over me, as I write these
words.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why didn‚Äôt we subscribe for an Irish newspaper for him?</Sentence> <Sentence>It
would have pleased him like nothing else.</Sentence> <Sentence>This business of remembering
is heavy work at times, so many things come back out of the past to
stab me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know my father was bitterly homesick for his Irish glens,
after we came to <Location>Manitoba</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not the stony soil of the Garafraxa
he remembered with longing, it was the misty bogs of <Location>Tipperary</Location> with
the little hummocks standing up like islands in a silver sea; he often
told me there was music in the very air of <Location>Ireland</Location> crickets in the
grass, the whirring of wings at nightfall, and more than that, a
gentle soft piping that is both merry and sad, and can turn the very
heart in you.</Sentence> <Sentence>I asked him if this was the music of the little people
who dance on the leaves and he said he was not rightly sure, but he
had heard it many a time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I do not know why we did not persuade him to go back to see the old
home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course, the expense was a barrier at first, but good years
came later, and money was no longer the question that decided
everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we thought of <Location>Ireland</Location> as a poverty-stricken country,
mouldy with rain, a country of tumble-down cabins, tragic old people,
rebellious young people, waiting for a boat to take them to <Location>America</Location>,
and we thought he was well away from it.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I know now that to the
end of his life he was under the spell of the mystic beauty of his
native land, and in his dreams he saw again the blue hills of
<Location>Tipperary</Location> and smelled the turf fires burning in the bog.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I was telling about our enjoyment of the weekly newspaper.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
continued story was really the high point of interest for we had a
whole week to speculate on the development of the plot.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was one
story that shook our neighborhood to its foundation.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was called
_Saved, or the Bride‚Äôs Sacrifice_, and concerned two beautiful
girls,‚ÄîJessie, fair as a lily, and Helen with blue black hair and
lustrous eyes as deep as night.</Sentence> <Sentence>They each loved Herbert, and Herbert,
being an obliging young fellow, not wishing to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings,
married one secretly and hurriedly by the light of a guttering candle,
in a peasant‚Äôs hut, (Jessie), and one openly with peal of organ and
general high jinks, at her father‚Äôs baronial castle, (Helen).</Sentence>

<Sentence>This naturally brought on complications.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were storms and
shipwrecks, and secret meetings in caves, with the tide rising over
the rocks and curlews screaming in the blast, there were plottings and
whisperings; a woman with second sight and one with the evil eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>And
did we love it?</Sentence>

<Sentence>I can remember staggering along through the snow, behind the sleigh
reading the story as I walked and when I drew near home, members of
the family would come out to shout at me to hurry.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXII‚ÄîTrouble in the <Location>North West</Location></Sentence>


<Sentence>As the winter wore away, and signs of spring began to come in the
honey combed snowdrifts that lowered and blackened in the soft March
winds, we became more and more agitated by the news that came through
from the <Location>North West</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Two women, Mrs. Delaney and Mrs. Gavanlock were taken prisoners by the
Indians and raids had been made on the settlers‚Äô horses and cattle.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The fate of the women was a shivery subject for conversation.</Sentence> <Sentence>Up to
that time the ‚Äútrouble‚Äù was a vague and abstract state, far away and
impersonal, but now the menace had come out into the open, and the
evil had assumed shape and image; painted savages, brandishing
tomahawks and uttering blood-curdling cries had swarmed around the
lonely and defenceless farm houses, and overpowered these two women
and carried them away to the Indian teepees somewhere in the wood,
holding them as hostages.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The newspapers flared with the news; and every inch of print was read
and re-read by us.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Naismiths took the Arnprior _Chronicle_, the
Ingrams, the Woodstock _Sentinel_, and we had the Owen Sound
_Advertiser_ and the _Family Herald_.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the news was old when we got
it and that worried us too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Under the strain of anxiety the neighbors
came together more, and there were many gatherings at our house.</Sentence> <Sentence>When
the boys came home from Brandon, they brought more newspapers and much
oral news.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes they saw the troops going through on the train,
with the cheering crowds at the station.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On the occasion of these gatherings, every wild scheme was advocated.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We should build a fort in Millford, using the mill for the main room,
boring port holes in the walls for the rifles and putting in flour and
bacon and potatoes, in case of a siege.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were four rifles in the
neighborhood and two shot guns.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were persistent rumors of a
‚Äúrising‚Äù at Swan Lake and Marieapolis on the Indian reserves there.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My mother stood firmly by her belief that the Indians would not hurt
the women.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWomen are safer with Indians than they would be with some
white men,‚Äù she said, but she was talked down by the others, who had
terrible tales to tell of atrocities in <Location>Minnesota</Location> and it seems that
most of them had relatives who survived that terrible time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At that stage in the conversation I was always sent to bed.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHannah take Nellie to bed‚Äîsee that she stays there.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Now Hannah was a stern and conscientious jailer but a very pleasant
one too.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYour business and mine is to get on with our school work, and not be
turned aside even by Indians,‚Äù she explained to me one night above the
sound of excited voices in the room below.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut if the Indians should come, what would we do?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I begged her to
tell me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNothing that we can arrange now,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou can‚Äôt get ready for
Indians, but I‚Äôm not afraid of Indians; especially our own Indians who
come selling baskets.</Sentence> <Sentence>They‚Äôre friendly and they don‚Äôt know anything
about the trouble in <Location>Saskatchewan</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>They can‚Äôt read and the trouble is
three hundred miles away.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, it‚Äôs in <Location>Saskatchewan</Location> and this is
<Location>Manitoba</Location>: now I‚Äôll hear you your spellings and don‚Äôt try to listen to
that clatter.</Sentence> <Sentence>They‚Äôre having a good time.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs as exciting as the
First of July picnic or a barn raising.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack Naismith and our Jack are
killing Indians by the dozen in their minds and piling them up like
cordwood and it‚Äôs not hurting anyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wish Lizzie didn‚Äôt have to
stay down there for she hates all this awful talk.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she has to stay
to feed the crowd.</Sentence> <Sentence>You and I are well out of it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>At night when I wakened in fear, dreaming of shrieking savages with
burning brands in their hands, I was comforted and reassured by
Hannah‚Äôs regular breathing.</Sentence> <Sentence>No terrifying dream disturbed her rest and
I kept telling myself if the Indians did come to kill us in a red rage
of anger, Hannah would talk them out of it, and mother would make tea
for them and feed them currant buns and get them persuaded to go back,
and make their baskets and behave themselves.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day in the early spring the cry arose at Northfield school that
the Indians were coming!</Sentence> <Sentence>Coming in their carts in a procession a mile
long, Billy Day said.</Sentence> <Sentence>Someone had seen them winding around Pelican
Lake like a jointed snake, as far as the eye could see.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were all
in war paint and feathers and their carts were creaking like ten
thousand wolves howling and they were coming this way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Billy had been staying home to seed, but no one could stay at home
after hearing news like this, so he came riding on horse-back; and
rushed into the school, breathless with haste, and so pale the
freckles stood out like bran on his face.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Consternation sat on every face as Bill‚Äôs excitement spread.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSit down, Bill,‚Äù Mr. Schultz said quietly, ‚Äúschool is in.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bill shouted his message again.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes, I know,‚Äù said the teacher, unmoved, ‚Äúthey come every spring, on
their way to Brandon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve been expecting them.</Sentence> <Sentence>These Indians are no
relation to the Indians in <Location>Saskatchewan</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are Crees, and ours are
Sioux and they are not friends.</Sentence> <Sentence>They won‚Äôt hurt anyone, certainly they
wouldn‚Äôt fight for the Crees.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indians have their friends just like
white people.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDad said to tell everyone to get their guns loaded and shoot to
kill,‚Äù Bill cried.</Sentence> <Sentence>Things weren‚Äôt breaking as well as he thought.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNow listen, Bill, and all of you,‚Äù Mr. Schultz‚Äô eyes glowed now; and
pink spots came out on his cheeks, ‚Äúa shot fired would be fatal.</Sentence> <Sentence>These
Indians are friendly.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know Indians.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are peaceful people until
they get frightened and you know how even a quiet dog will bite when
taken by surprise.</Sentence> <Sentence>They are like that.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Custer massacre happened
because some white fool shot at three Indians, who came to a house to
ask for something to eat; and the Indians got frightened and shot
back.</Sentence> <Sentence>My wife and the two little boys are alone, in a house right
beside the trail, where the Indians pass and I know they are safe.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
think I will let you all go home and tell your people not to be
afraid, just buy their baskets the same as ever, and give them tea or
whatever they want; and don‚Äôt let on you know there is any trouble.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We rushed for our things and came out into the sunshine.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bill was in a
rage at the turn of affairs.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe teacher is yellow,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs
afraid, that‚Äôs what he is.</Sentence> <Sentence>My dad ain‚Äôt, you bet, and he‚Äôll take a
shot at the redskins; he says, there‚Äôs only one good Indian and he‚Äôs a
dead one.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was one of those breathing days in spring, when mist comes from the
soil, and the sun draws the young plants out of the ground.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was
a palpitation in the air, a sense of movement and growth.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every sound
was magnified in the still air.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hens‚Äô cackle and the rooster‚Äôs
crowing in Davy Dick‚Äôs farm yard a mile from us, sounded clearly on
the air.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tommy Kennedy put his ear to the ground and motioned to us to
keep quiet.</Sentence> <Sentence>He sprang up hastily.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúGol, they‚Äôre comin‚Äô,‚Äù he shouted, ‚ÄúI hear carts squealin‚Äô in the
hills, but they‚Äôre only a few, and they‚Äôre not comin‚Äô this way.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz came out bare-headed and spoke to us again.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNow don‚Äôt get
excited,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúremember this country all belonged to the Indians
once and they see us as usurpers.</Sentence> <Sentence>We took their land and drove out
their best friend, the buffalo.</Sentence> <Sentence>Use your imaginations now, and think
what you would feel like, if you saw another race living on the land
that had been yours; another color; other ways of living; feeling
themselves superior.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll stay here and talk to them‚Äîthey will have to
come this way and don‚Äôt let a gun be seen; go now, young messengers of
good will, you have a real duty to perform.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went; we raced like the wind, watching the <Location>Tiger Hills</Location>, south of
us, for some sign of the long caravan of creaking carts, that Bill had
said was on its way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were tingling with excitement and thrilling with a sense of
adventure.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now we knew how the heroes of the Fiery Cross could run so
far.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our feet were shod with speed, that ate up the miles.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nap met me at the usual place, and even he was bristled up and barked
at us.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had something on his mind too; but we hadn‚Äôt time to bother
with him, beyond yelling at him to shut up.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were half way from Will‚Äôs house to ours before we noticed strange
objects in our yard, Indian carts‚ÄîIndian ponies hitched to carts and
strange dogs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nap barked out again a ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I tell you‚Äù bark.</Sentence>

<Sentence>What would we do?</Sentence> <Sentence>Hide down by the creek in the bushes?</Sentence> <Sentence>Run back to
the school?</Sentence> <Sentence>We paused for a moment, irresolute.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, there was only one
thing to do, we must go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We saw there were three carts and the
ponies had wandered over to the oat stack and were pulling out the
straws.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nap bristled up to twice his size and stepped like a hackney
at the sight of two Indian dogs with curled tails, under the carts, as
peacefully withdrawn from public affairs as dogs could very well be,
but Nap resented their presence, on his territory and began a
preliminary growl in the back of his throat.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThere can‚Äôt be anything wrong,‚Äù Hannah said, but I could feel my
heart beating in my throat.</Sentence> <Sentence>All the stories I ever heard of Indians
and their evil ways came to my mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of the Donnelly murder
in Bedolph and of how young Jim Donnelly escaped by being at a
neighbor‚Äôs house that night, the only one of the family to survive.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But nothing could be more peaceful than the farm yard that moment.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Hens and chickens circled the space in front of the horse stables, the
hens scratching and calling, and the little balls of feathers coming
in like the spokes of a wheel, a rooster crowed from the top of a
manure pile that steamed in the warm air, cows lay at ease beside the
straw stack, for there was no green grass yet to tempt them away from
the oat straw.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On the three sides of the group of buildings, the creek ran full
between its low banks, with a brown glint in its swift current.</Sentence> <Sentence>White
clouds loitered above us in the blue sky; every aspect of the day and
the place spoke of peace.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah did not falter in her gait, and I followed her.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we opened
the kitchen door the room seemed to be full of Indians; at least the
floor was covered by them, for with their blankets and shawls, one
squaw, with a papoose can cover much space; the acrid smell of burned
willow roots and tanned hide filled the air.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On the other side of the stove, with the oven open, Mother sat in a
rocking chair, with a flannel on her knee on which lay an Indian baby,
a poor little wrinkled thing with a face like an old man, whimpering
softly like a sick puppy.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was rubbing its chest with goose-grease.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The mother, a young squaw, was on her knees watching with impassive
face.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The table was full of their baskets and the kettle on the stove was
beginning to steam.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie was in the pantry buttering bread.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúShut the door, girls,‚Äù Mother said, ‚Äúand come in, and see what I
have.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, he‚Äôs been sick, poor little fellow, but I think he‚Äôll be
better now.</Sentence> <Sentence>He has had a heavy cold on his chest, and needs to be more
warmly dressed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now look, Mary Paul, roll him up this way, so his feet
won‚Äôt come out, keep his feet warm and his head cool.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, keep the
flannel on him and rub him each night with this; giving him two or
three drops like this, see, no more than this‚Äîit will loosen his
cough.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She handed the baby back to his mother and a succession of
appreciative grunts came from the circle.</Sentence> <Sentence>The young mother said
something we did not understand but her face lost its mask of
indifference.</Sentence> <Sentence>She actually smiled as she took the baby in her arms.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Another squaw came over to where mother sat and showed a sore ear,
moaning as she touched it with her grimy hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>After the ear had been
washed with soap and water, a few drops of laudanum were put in, and
an onion was put in the ashes to roast, and when it was well heated
through, it was cautiously put on the sore ear and bandaged with a
white rag.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before the visit was over, it appeared that all of the squaws were
birds with broken pinions.</Sentence> <Sentence>The last one, a big woman who smoked a
short clay pipe, complained of a pain in her stomach and received a
generous draught of baking soda.</Sentence> <Sentence>The two men were evidently sound or
at least did not reveal their ailments.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they drank cups of tea
with every sign of delight and ate heartily.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was well on to the middle of the afternoon when they left‚Äîmother
bought two baskets from them and just as they were leaving the sick
baby‚Äôs mother went out to her cart and brought in a mat of sweet grass
in which was woven a pattern of porcupine quills, and gave it to
mother.</Sentence>

<Sentence>They went the rounds of the neighborhood, and were so well fed and
showered with gifts of flour, potatoes, eggs and butter that they must
have wondered, if Indians do wonder, at the sudden warming of hearts
that had taken place.</Sentence> <Sentence>Houses that had been closed and locked to them,
on former visits, while the owners had looked out from behind the edge
of factory cotton blinds, now were opened hospitably and kettles were
boiled and meat was fried for the visiting delegates.</Sentence> <Sentence>So it came about
that the misdeeds of their brethren in the <Location>North West</Location> brought gifts
and friendliness to the Indians at Pelican Lake, and they, very
wisely, took the tide, as it served.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The ‚Äúrisin‚Äô‚Äù that Bill‚Äôs friend had seen coming round the end of the
lake, like a jointed snake, must have been lost in the labyrinthine
hills, for the three carts were the only Indian visitors until the
following autumn, when the trouble was over.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The day that the sick Indian baby got his rubbing of goose grease, was
April 24th, the day that guns roared at Fish Creek.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The _Family Herald_ were advertising a cheap rate in their daily
paper‚Äîthree months for $2.00, and I determined to get it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a
feeling that daily news was what we needed, in this time of great
import.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I sold my best white duck to Mrs. Kennedy who paid me $1.50
and I had the other fifty cents (won from Jack on a bet.</Sentence> <Sentence>He bet I
could not finish the stockings I was knitting in a week, and I did,
though it nearly killed me, for I was a slow knitter).</Sentence> <Sentence>I sent away for
the paper and I think I expected to get one each day, for when five of
them arrived on mail day at Millford, not one date any later than the
_Weekly Star_, I felt a bit cheated, but I carried one to school each
day, still unwrapped, and so the prestige I hoped to win, was not all
lost.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had a map on the board and followed the troops, under General
Middleton, as well as we could; and talked long and loud, and
earnestly over the daily reports, before and after school and at noon
hour.</Sentence> <Sentence>Piapot, Poundmaker, Big Bear, and Louis David Riel and Gabriel
Dumont‚Äôs pictures were stuck on the wall with molasses, furnished by
Thos.</Sentence> <Sentence>James Kennedy‚Äôs lunch.</Sentence> <Sentence>We dwelt in the midst of alarms, but no
one ever enjoyed it more.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At noon, we played one game and one only.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indians and soldiers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
an Indian Chief (Poundmaker) and had a red and yellow lap-robe for my
blanket.</Sentence> <Sentence>Billy Day led the Free Lances, a force of young bloods who
fired on the Indians at all times, even when we‚Äîthe Indians‚Äîwere
holding a parley with the Government forces led by Bert Ingram who was
General Middleton.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had to expect the odd death-tipped arrow from
Billy‚Äôs forces, who did not believe in any other means of
communication.</Sentence> <Sentence>No talk, no conferences, no truce, just extermination.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get him‚Äîhe gits me‚Äù was Billy‚Äôs slogan, and so in this way
we had all the excitement of a three-cornered conflict.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I made a good Poundmaker, for I had the two long braids of hair, with
moccasin laces braided in, and tied at the ends; and as chief I had
many opportunities for making speeches.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bert‚Äôs forces were very active and spent much time in throwing up
breast work, which meant moving the wood pile and arranging for port
holes for their rifles.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My forces had bows and arrows of home manufacture, decorated with
tufts of red and blue yarn, and we beat the tom-toms as we advanced on
the Fort and ki-yied.</Sentence> <Sentence>The tin lids of dinner pails make very good
tom-toms.</Sentence>

<Sentence>While we circled and ambushed and surrendered and fought and died
outside, Hannah sat at her desk, taking no time for play but improving
every dull or shining minute, as she poured over Lord‚Äôs big blue
History or ‚Äúfactored‚Äù great long phrases of x‚Äôs and y‚Äôs and z‚Äôs with a
sprinkling of a‚Äôs, b‚Äôs and c‚Äôs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I felt a bit guilty about the time I was spending as Poundmaker, but
it was too much fun to forego, and I loved making up his speeches
about waving grass and running streams, waning moons and setting suns,
with plenty of references to the White Queen across the shoreless
waters.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXIII‚ÄîThe Tragic Ending</Sentence>


<Sentence>When in July the news came that the <Location>North West</Location> rebellion was over and
Riel captured a great wave of thanksgiving swept over <Location>Western Canada</Location>,
not entirely free from a bit of disappointment that our excitement
would now die down.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, there was still the fertile field of
speculation as to the final outcome.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The die-hards cried out for blood.</Sentence> <Sentence>The death of Thomas Scott in the
first Rebellion, fifteen years before, must be avenged; no mercy had
been shown to him.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the moderate party, of which Mr. Schultz was
the leader, believed that no good end could be served by Riel‚Äôs death,
for he would thereby become a martyr in the eyes of the Metis, his
followers, and great bitterness would result, and surely if there had
been wrong-doing on the part of the half-breeds, they were now broken,
scattered and utterly defeated.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were our own people after all and
it was always the part of wisdom to show mercy in the hour of triumph.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schultz did not think that the Government had any desire for
further retaliation, and thought they would have been relieved if Riel
had escaped after the final rout at Batoche.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was rumoured that he
might easily have done so, and made his way unmolested back to his
home across the border in <Location>Montana</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he did not want to escape, for
it was his desire to defend the half-breeds in an open court where he
would have the ear of the whole country.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Each week we read the _Family Herald_ and the Brandon _Times_ for the
last word on the situation and waited anxiously for the trial which
was going to be held in <Location>Regina</Location> where Riel was imprisoned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Riel wanted to make his own defence and refused the offer of counsel.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But in spite of this the Government sent two famous lawyers from
<Location>Montreal</Location> to defend him, and they without consulting him, decided to
enter the plea of insanity as the surest way of saving his life, and
there is but little doubt that they would have succeeded but for Riel
himself, who, stung by their arguments, forgot his intention of
presenting the case for the half-breeds and spent all his time trying
to establish the fact that he was perfectly sane.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He could have saved himself, we thought, if he had carried out his
original plan, but, as it was, he made a poor impression upon the
court and alienated public sympathy.</Sentence> <Sentence>The whole trial was a tragedy of
cross purposes, and the verdict of the court was that he was guilty of
treason.</Sentence> <Sentence>The date of his execution was set for October but on appeal
to the Judge twenty-nine days more of life were granted to the
condemned man to allow him to finish the Memoirs he was writing.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
wrote a letter to the Judge thanking him for this favor and praying
that one year for each day would be added to his life for this act of
clemency.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We did not believe he would be hanged.</Sentence> <Sentence>A reprieve would surely come.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We had read about reprieves and a very thrilling business it was with
a dishevelled rider, on a foaming horse galloping up to the foot of
the gallows waving a document and shouting ‚ÄúThe pardon of the King.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>As the seventh of November drew near we talked of nothing else as we
walked the two miles night and morning to school in the crisp autumn
weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had convinced ourselves that Riel would be pardoned basing
our hopes on the fact that a Commission had been sent out to the
half-breeds and all the difficulties had been settled so we argued
that Riel and his followers had not asked anything unreasonable, and
we knew that the French people were asking for his pardon.</Sentence> <Sentence>A reprieve
would surely come and we loved to picture the scene though Hannah said
there would not be a galloping horse, that was all out of date.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
pardon would come by telegraph if it came at all.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But we set that aside.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps the wires would be down.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were so
sure that a reprieve, or a pardon, would come that we arranged the
scene and if we could have been free from the restraining presence of
the teacher for one noon hour we would have acted it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Joe Rothwell had
his pony and he would have ridden in with a clatter of hooves from a
mile down the road, rising in his stirrups, and shouting.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had the
best part of all.</Sentence> <Sentence>We painted the scene with a broad brush.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Dawn in the cold grey jail-yard of the Mounted Police barracks in
<Location>Regina</Location>, on the morning of November the seventh.</Sentence> <Sentence>The melancholy
procession from the death cell.</Sentence> <Sentence>The guards pale and wretched, hating
their job, hands trembling, teeth chattering.</Sentence> <Sentence>Louis David Riel pale
but calm with head erect walks to the scaffold and mounts the steps,
without a quiver, disdaining the hand of the guard who would have
helped him.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>He stands aloft, a gallant figure of a man against
the flushing sky.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>When asked if he desires to speak, he shakes
his head and cries ‚ÄúGod is my judge and to Him I commit my soul.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù When
the bandage is put over his eyes he politely thanks the hangman and
holds it away from his eyes for one moment while he looks around the
landscape and up at the clouds flecked with sunrise.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Then pulls
it down and gives his hands to be pinned behind his back and
waits.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>The priest begins the prayer for the passing soul and the
noose is placed over his head.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>A shout goes up from the guard at the Barracks gate and the hangman
stops with his foot on the trap.</Sentence> <Sentence>There is a thunder of hooves on the
frozen ground, and a foaming horse is reined back on his haunches and
the rider flings himself out of the saddle saying one word that runs
from lip to lip, ‚ÄúThe pardon has come.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a great scene and we were not the only people who thought and
hoped and prayed for this ending but it was decreed otherwise.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
distracted Cabinet at <Location>Ottawa</Location> had argued and reasoned and disputed up
to midnight the night before uncertain of what course they should
take‚Äîweighing every political advantage, and disadvantage.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we
heard that the sentence had been carried out we were shocked into
silence and we stopped talking about it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We read in the _Family Herald_ that there were riots in the streets of
<Location>Montreal</Location> when the news of the hanging broke and that the effigy of Sir
John A. Macdonald had been burned on a public square.</Sentence> <Sentence>One of the
leaders of a hostile demonstration was a young Frenchman who said that
he too would have shouldered his rifle if he had been a half-breed on
the banks of the <Location>Saskatchewan</Location>, and when the House of Commons assembled
he defended the rebels in a fiery speech that had never been surpassed
in eloquence.</Sentence> <Sentence>In it he taunted the Government that they had granted
everything the half-breeds had asked for but not until all the harm
had been done and the blood spilled and the bitter wedge put between
the two races in <Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>His name was Wilfrid Laurier.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXIV‚ÄîThe Dramateurs</Sentence>


<Sentence>Our next venture in dramatization was made a year afterwards in the
safe realm of fiction.</Sentence> <Sentence>We decided to do something for Millford School,
five miles away, for their closing exercises.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Millford School had paid us a visit on several occasions, and on May
24th had beaten us in a spelling match, (who would have thought that
‚Äúskilful‚Äù would have only one ‚Äúl‚Äù); and by way of return we set about
to produce a scene from ‚ÄúTen Nights in a Bar-room‚Äù to give at their
closing concert on the last day in June.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had worked more than a month on it, and rehearsed it in the shade
of the sun-baked woodpile every day at noon.</Sentence> <Sentence>We made our own
properties, had written our own lines, and now, in our best clothes,
carrying our shoes to save them from the dust of the prairie trail, we
were on our way to fame and glory.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The hot moist air of June was heavily freighted with the sweetness of
wolf willow blossoms, as our little band of barefooted pilgrims took
their way over the North trail.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bob, who played the part of Simon
Slade, the fat and prosperous proprietor of the ‚ÄúSheaf and Sickle‚Äù,
carried his own bar, a high bench painted barn-red.</Sentence> <Sentence>The bottles, of
which we carried a generous supply, were distributed among all the
members of the caste, and stuck out of pockets and dinner pails,
giving our band a rakish and sinister appearance which must have been
offset somewhat by our serious young faces.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I, being poor Fanny Morgan, the drunkard‚Äôs wife, carried, carefully
wrapped in a big newspaper, my mother‚Äôs shawl, which had come from
<Location>Dundee</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a green shawl, with red, yellow, and black lines,
making an elaborate pattern, and it had belonged to my
grandmother.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I had not asked my mother for it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I could
not convince her of how badly I needed it, and I couldn‚Äôt ask any of
the other women for a shawl when there was one in my own family.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I
took it‚Äîand that lay heavily on my conscience .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>but what could I
do?</Sentence> <Sentence>I had to carry the baby in a shawl, when I went to Simon Slade‚Äôs
barroom to look for Henry.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had come straight from school, and walked the five miles, carrying
the remains of our dinner in the tin pails, and we had our last
rehearsal when we stopped to eat, at the junction of Spring <Location>Brook</Location> and
<Location>Oak Creek</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But first we washed our feet, put on our shoes, and the
ladies of the party released their hair from its many tight braids;
then we set up our red bar on the gravelly shore, and put on our act,
glad to get one chance to present it undisturbed by the young
dissenters, who, with no appreciation of the classics had mocked us,
and hindered us, with their interruptions at our other rehearsals
behind the woodpile.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The ‚Äúbaby‚Äù should have been a little girl called Mary, according to
Mr. T. S. Arthur‚Äôs text, but we had no little girl with fair curls,
and I was determined to have fair curls showing at one end of the
green shawl and bare feet at the other, so we had a little boy of
seven, who had a mop of yellow hair.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had to have a fair-sized child
who could walk the five miles there and back, and Benny was able for
that and more.</Sentence> <Sentence>The part was a minor one, but important.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had to say,
‚ÄúFather, won‚Äôt you come home?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù but he had to say it in a ‚Äúlow pleading
voice, full of sorrowful love, too deep for the heart of a child.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I
am quoting Mr. Arthur‚Äôs own words, and as director of the play I had
put a lot of time on Benny,‚Äîand had promised him a beautiful glass
alley, if he said his words nicely.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The final rehearsal was entirely satisfactory, and with light hearts
and high hopes, we continued our journey, walking well up on the grass
to keep the dust from our shining shoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>We crossed the bridge,
skirted the high bank of <Location>Oak Creek</Location>, and climbed the hill to the level
field where Millford School stood, surrounded now by horses and rigs,
and a swarm of people.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our teacher had not been able to come with us, so Bob, (Simon Slade)
who was sixteen, and the eldest of the company, made our presence
known to the Millford teacher; and we were warmly welcomed, and
invited to come over to the long table where the women were clearing
up the remains of the supper.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were given salmon sandwiches and tea,
and everyone was glad to see us.</Sentence> <Sentence>After that we inspected the stage and
the curtain, and found all in order.</Sentence> <Sentence>The stage was small, but well
lighted with bracket lamps, and we put up our bar and the bottles, and
wished that we might begin.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew our parts, and were fearful of
delay.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sun was still several yards high, and did not seem to give
an inch, and we knew a play would hardly seem right without artificial
lights.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The baby had been left at the table, with his brother Joe (the
bartender), while Bob, Bert, Lena, and I inspected the stage.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had
given us a little trouble in the dress rehearsal, and seemed to be
holding out for another alley, but we were entirely unprepared for the
blow that fell on us, when Joe came running in to tell us that he
couldn‚Äôt find Benny anywhere, and was afraid he had gone home.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
dashed out and called.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone looked and shouted.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then a little girl
said she had seen a little boy go over the hill, barefooted and
travelling fast.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Benny!</Sentence> <Sentence>He had deserted us!</Sentence> <Sentence>The baby had gone
home over the sandhills‚Äîcurls, and bare feet, and the low pleading
voice full of sorrowful love‚Äîand what could we do?</Sentence>

<Sentence>A search began for a substitute.</Sentence> <Sentence>I canvassed the crowd, now filing
into the school.</Sentence> <Sentence>I coaxed and bribed.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou won‚Äôt need to speak‚Äîjust
cry a little, and I will pinch you when the time comes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù There were no
bidders.</Sentence> <Sentence>At last I got a big eight-year-old girl, a heavy child, who
lay like a bag of wheat in my arms.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had no curls, and she wouldn‚Äôt
take off her boots; they were new ones.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she wriggled.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we put
on our act.</Sentence> <Sentence>With that squirming sand-bag in my arms I made my speech.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I told Simon Slade he would have been a happier man, if he had
remained an honest miller, grinding wheat into flour to feed and
nourish his neighbors.</Sentence> <Sentence>I warned him that the ruin he was bringing to
others would fall upon him and his.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I pleaded with Henry, my
Henry, to come home.</Sentence> <Sentence>The fat one cried at the right place, but spoiled
the effect by tapering it off with a giggle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The barroom loafers jeered at me, and asked Henry why he didn‚Äôt keep
me at home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then Henry seemed to sober up a little and said he was not
going to have his wife insulted, and would never put his foot in this
cursed place again.</Sentence> <Sentence>So Henry and I and the baby go out, and the fun
goes on.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Slade comes in just in time to see her boy, who is
minding the bar, take a drink on the sly, and foresees his ruin.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
cries and wrings her hands.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Henry, who evidently has given me the slip comes back and lines up at
the bar.</Sentence> <Sentence>Simon Slade applauds him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then the curtain falls, and three
years pass.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the curtain was drawn back on Act II we were all there, except
little Mary, who had died, and I stood there bereaved (but relieved
too), draped in my shawl.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am older and grayer and still looking for
Henry.</Sentence> <Sentence>Simon Slade had grown coarse, dishevelled and stout (Bob had
roughened his hair, and stuffed a towel under his vest, and the effect
was wonderful.</Sentence>) <Sentence>Old Judge Hammond, the Mayor of Cedarville, stood, a
trembling old man, leaning on his cane.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we weren‚Äôt sorry for
him‚Äîhe had thought a barroom was a good thing for Cedarville.</Sentence> <Sentence>Willie
Hammond, his son, lies dead on the floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Someone had thrown a bottle
and killed him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Slade comes in, sees what has happened and
screams.</Sentence> <Sentence>Frank Slade, the proprietor‚Äôs son, is asleep in his chair,
too drunk to notice.</Sentence> <Sentence>Simon Slade turns to fly, but the sheriff appears
with a warrant for his arrest, and an order to close the ‚ÄúSheaf and
Sickle.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>And it is all over!</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>We walked home in the starlit night, travelling together about half
the distance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then our roads divided.</Sentence> <Sentence>An old moon hung low in the
southwest, and the sky was clear with millions of stars.</Sentence> <Sentence>Little warm
breezes came curling up from the hollows, fragrant and friendly.</Sentence> <Sentence>About
a mile from the home the old dog met me, and although I was not
afraid, I was glad to have him.</Sentence> <Sentence>And suddenly I felt tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it‚Äôs
nothing to be tired when you are happy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our act had gone well.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
people said it was ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not lose the shawl, and when the
sun rose the next day, it would be the First of July!</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The first novel I read, was _Meadow Brook_ by Mary Jane Holmes, a worn
and battered copy of which fell into my hands somehow.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a lovely
story written in the first person, and the heroine was the youngest of
her family, who was misunderstood by them and criticized by them for
talking too much.</Sentence> <Sentence>All these circumstances helped me to see myself in
its glamorous pages.</Sentence> <Sentence>I read it eagerly and with rapture, and when this
wonderful little girl, with a heart of gold, was so bitterly
misunderstood that she decided to lie on the dewy grass, catch cold
and die, to spite her unfeeling family, I thought it a fine idea, and
served them right.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Indeed, there were many times, when I, sitting out minding the cows
from the crop, spent a happy hour planning by own funeral.</Sentence> <Sentence>I marched
my whole family past my coffin, and let them look at my poor pale,
withered face, beautiful even in death, and I listened to their
belated penitence with keen satisfaction.</Sentence> <Sentence>Especially Jack; I certainly
let him repent, in a big way.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tears streamed down his cheeks and his
voice was choked with sobs as he bitterly cried ‚ÄúShe was too good to
live!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Having all the arrangements for the funeral in my own hands, I spared
neither trouble nor expense.</Sentence> <Sentence>The flowers were beautiful, and their
perfume loaded the air.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there was music‚ÄîLizzie sang.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie had
nothing to repent of, so I let her sing and hoped the words of her
song fell heavily on the hearts of those who listened.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped they
fell like clods on a coffin;</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúIf we knew the baby fingers
    Pressed against the window pane
  Would be cold and stiff tomorrow
    Never trouble us again.</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Would the bright eyes of our darling
    Catch the frown upon our brow
  Would the print of baby fingers
    Vex us then, as they do now.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The young heroine in the book did catch cold on the dewy grass, and
did get pneumonia.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I did not go that far, I knew what I would get
if I got a cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>It would not be anything as romantic as pneumonia.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
would have a mustard plaster on my chest and get goose-oil, in large,
and regular doses.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When my delightful little heroine grew up she had many lovers, who
wooed her on bended knee, but coldly she turned away from their gaze,
for once she had seen a face in a crowd, a dark, but beautiful face,
chiselled in lines of surpassing loveliness, with burning glowing
eyes, and to this dark unknown she gave her love.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She had a friend who had married a drunkard, and was having a hard
time, and often my little friend had wondered how her friend could
endure her life of trial.</Sentence> <Sentence>Certainly she would never let Herbert (the
drunkard) away with such rough stuff.</Sentence> <Sentence>But then she thought ‚ÄúIf it were
the dark man of my dreams, with the radiant glowing, burning
eyes.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>would I endure it then?</Sentence> . . . . <Sentence>And the answer welled up
from her faithful, loving heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ah, yes, with gladness!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I do not know why this appealed to me, but it did.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loved every page
in the battered old volume.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXV‚ÄîThe Party</Sentence>


<Sentence>My brother Will‚Äôs new house before the partitions were put in, was
used for a dance, a community affair, to which the invitation was the
usual flat one of ‚ÄúCome Everybody.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Social occasions were so few that
no one must be left out, and the settlement was still too new for
quarrels.</Sentence> <Sentence>So if you knew of a dance you went to it and were sure of a
welcome.</Sentence> <Sentence>The word was passed around by various means, drivers of grain
sleighs going to Brandon, men cutting wood along the river banks,
people getting their mail at Millford carried the news, and the few
worshippers at the Monthly Service in the school spoke of it too.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Real old-fashioned shouting Methodists spoke of it, but did not come.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They shook their heads, and said no good ever came of a dance,
especially round dances.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father objected to them too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Reels and
quadrilles had symmetry and beauty, he said, but round dances were
nothing but ‚Äúhand-dragging‚Äù, and an offence to the eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>Usually I
followed my father in everything, being proud of his dignified speech;
but on this subject, I was at variance with him and quite ashamed of
his attack, and particularly of this coarse expression; though Mr.
Alfred Noyes, in his poem ‚ÄúThe Victory Dance‚Äù, many years later used
an equally offensive one when he spoke of ‚Äúa fat wet hand, on a fat
wet back.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could not see any objection to round dances.</Sentence> <Sentence>At School, we spent
many happy noon-hours, when Mr. Schultz went to his boarding house for
lunch, circling around the stove to the strained notes of Billy Day‚Äôs
jews-harp, breathing forth the ‚ÄúJenny Lind‚Äù Polka and the ‚ÄúArkansas
Traveller‚Äù.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There would be round dances at Will‚Äôs party, and at first father said
he wouldn‚Äôt go, and at that a gulf of despair opened under my young
feet, for if he stayed home I would not have a chance of going.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
only hope of ever getting to a dance was that I could not stay at home
alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I put that to him when we were tying in the cows one cold
evening.</Sentence> <Sentence>He stood leaning on his pitchfork, behind the cows, and did
not reply for a few minutes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I had to approach the subject in a
more subtle way.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI saw a picture of a dancer, with her hands on her hips, twirling
around,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd show me those steps.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúStep dancing,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis a fine art and if it were not for my
rheumatism I‚Äôd be glad to show you‚Äîthen, when it comes to
‚Äòbalance-all‚Äô, you could let your feet twinkle and cavort.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I saw my advantage, and pressed him to show me, and in the warmth of
the stable I took off my coat and prepared to imitate every movement.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He lilted the ‚ÄúFisher‚Äôs Hornpipe‚Äù, and showed me two pretty steps, and
when I got them he was pleased with me, and I knew I could go to the
party; or at least he would not bar my way.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúStrike into this one,‚Äù he
said, ‚Äútap with your left and whirl on your right and you‚Äôll have them
all watching you!</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs a graceful movement!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had another reason for wanting to go, one which I now discreetly
kept to myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy Sloan, who in addition to his many attractions,
was a fiddler, had called out to me when we met on the road that he
was going to have a dance with me at Will‚Äôs party.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The night of the party came at last, a clear moonlight night, with a
great sky full of stars, and a glistening world of snow.</Sentence> <Sentence>As early as
seven o‚Äôclock sleigh bells chimed their cheerful notes through the
frosty air as the sleighs came crunching along the heavy trails.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our long table had been taken over to Will‚Äôs house and was piled with
cakes and sandwiches covered with a red and white table cloth.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rolled
jelly cakes with apple-jelly filling, cinnamon buns, and apple pies,
fruit cake, doughnuts, and cookies were there in abundance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs.
Naismith would bring cakes, too, and Mrs. William Johnston gem-jars of
cream for the coffee; they were the only people in the neighborhood
who had fresh cows.</Sentence> <Sentence>The coffee would be made in two preserving kettles
on Will‚Äôs big new stove.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cups would be brought too, with red and blue
or grey yarn tied around their handles; to distinguish them, for they
were all plain white ironstone.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll have the full of the house tonight,‚Äù Mother said, ‚Äúfor the
night is so fine.</Sentence> <Sentence>There will be no room to dance but they‚Äôll be glad
to get together anyway and maybe they can play games; but remember
Will don‚Äôt let anyone start the kissing game; I‚Äôd rather have dancing
any day.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She was wearing her brown poplin, which Lizzie had made over
with a cream lace jabot.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôll be able to dance all right,‚Äù Will said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe have three fiddlers
coming and can‚Äôt waste all that good music, and Tom Clyde will call
off.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve been at plenty of dances where we hadn‚Äôt half as much room.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will had grown a moustache and looked very handsome in a navy blue
striped suit.</Sentence> <Sentence>He and Lily, the girl he was to marry, would be the
finest couple on the floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother‚Äôs criticism of Will‚Äôs choice was
that they were too much alike, hair and eyes the same color and both
had small hands and feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had not forgotten the beautiful
blonde he had left behind him in Grey county; the blue-eyed Anne with
her fine capable hands.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At the dance Lily was dressed in a gray blue silk dress with flounces
on the skirt, and her slippers had silver buckles.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a little
bird-like thing with a childish voice, and graceful movements, who
looked no more than seventeen, and being the youngest of her family
was still considered a child by her elders.</Sentence> <Sentence>When Mother spoke of her
she always shook her head but we knew it was because of her loyalty to
the Grey county girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt sorry for Annie too for to lose my
brother Will must be desolation, indeed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still Will had his own life
to live and must make his own choice.</Sentence>

<Sentence>What an evening that was, lasting until the saffron light of morning
stained the east!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fortunately for me there was a dearth of ladies, so I was asked for
the first quadrille by Dan Thorne.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was one of our neighbors and his
wife, who was much younger than he was, was dancing with Jimmy Sloan,
who lived on the next farm to theirs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Thorne should have danced
with her husband, for this was the first dance of the evening, but
everyone knew she didn‚Äôt care anything about poor old Dan.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
sympathy of the neighborhood was with Dan.</Sentence> <Sentence>The women said he was too
good to her and she did not know enough to appreciate him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He even
brought her breakfast to bed on the lid of the boiler.</Sentence> <Sentence>At any rate
Mrs. Thorne was the neighborhood mystery, with her city clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then
there was the ruby necklace, which she always wore even around the
house.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was never seen without it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It may have been glass or it may
not, opinions differed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Certainly it glowed like fire.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had been a
waitress in a hotel when Dan met her and it was more charitable to
believe the necklace was an imitation, for how could a hotel waitress
have a real ruby necklace set in gold?</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was dancing with Dan Thorne at the third figure when the fiddlers
began the Fisher‚Äôs Hornpipe and I got my chance.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the caller-off
gave the command ‚Äúdance to your partner, and corner the same;‚Äù I did
my steps, and so well, that I did receive applause, and plenty of it
and the caller-off gave me the floor.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But there is a law that never ceases to operate in human affairs, and
I fell under its operation in this intoxicating moment.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It is
called the law of diminishing returns.</Sentence> <Sentence>Being able to dance had brought
me to this place of delight, but being able to dance well caused me to
be banished from, it.</Sentence> <Sentence>My Mother was horrified to see me whirl and bend
with my hands on my hips; while the company watched and cheered, and
when the dance was over she called me aside.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs more your father‚Äôs fault than yours,‚Äù she said ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre too
young a girl to carry on like this, whirling your legs like a
play-actor; with everyone looking at you.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I want you to go
upstairs and quiet yourself.</Sentence> <Sentence>You looked like a wild thing there and I
couldn‚Äôt bear to look at you.</Sentence> <Sentence>Don‚Äôt think the people applauded you
because your performance was pretty; people are always willing for
someone else to play the fool for their entertainment.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now, you can
stay upstairs until the refreshments are served and then you can come
down.</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs three babies on the bed and you can look after them.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They might cry and nobody would hear them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can‚Äôt watch you when I
have so many things to look after, and I won‚Äôt be worried about you,
if you are there.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted a word with father before I went or even a look.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to
know what he thought.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had pleased him, and I was pretty sure I
had, I wouldn‚Äôt care for anything.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had had my fling!</Sentence> <Sentence>He was standing
near the stairs when I passed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I pulled his coat sleeve to let him
know that I was there, ‚ÄúWell done, Sparrow-Shins!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he said with a
smile and patted my shoulder.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could have gone cheerfully to the
Black Hole of <Location>Calcutta</Location> after that.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went upstairs humming the
Fisher‚Äôs Hornpipe.</Sentence> <Sentence>A light burned low on the home-made dresser, and
the heat from the stairway augmented by a black pot of live coals made
the big room comfortable.</Sentence> <Sentence>I looked at my three small charges sound
asleep on the bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were two beds in the room; the other one held
the wraps of the women.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The babies slept soundly in spite of the noise that came from below;
the music of the fiddlers, the scraping of feet, the voice of the
caller-off, rising above the waves of conversation that had a rhythm
of its own.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was strange that they could sleep so well.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stole back
to the stairway to hear what I could but the fragments of conversation
that came up did not interest me, it was all of horses, and harness,
and grain prices and heavy roads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I was still glowing with the sense of elation that came when I
danced, a glorious feeling that swept me out of myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could
understand why girls climbed down from upstairs windows to go to
dances.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could do it too; probably would some time.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was nothing
wrong in, dancing.</Sentence> <Sentence>How could there be?</Sentence> <Sentence>Dead leaves whirled and circled
and soared in the wind, so light and lithe, and graceful.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to
dance like them, just by myself, with music lifting my feet as if by
magic.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was something in my blood that answered the rhythm.</Sentence> . . .
<Sentence>But I must be quiet, or I would disturb the babies.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was not lonely
in my temporary exile for I had the best part of the party in the
music that cut through all the sounds and came up to me in a crimson
tide of melody.</Sentence> . . . .

<Sentence>I thought of the prairie chickens in the spring, just before they
settle down to hatch out their young.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had seen them dancing in
circles, bobbing and bowing, nodding and hopping with their feet tight
together, like a man‚Äôs in a sack race.</Sentence> <Sentence>And so carried away by
excitement were they, that anyone could creep up on them.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Many a
bird came to an inglorious end that way, struck down by some
unscrupulous person.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew very well that Mother was more afraid for me than for either
Hannah or Lizzie.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there were times when I shared her fears.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was the time when I met the Kennedy family who settled on Section 22,
just east of us, and I went away with them, forgetting that I had the
cattle to herd; forgetting that I had on the one pair of boots that
Hannah and I used to protect our feet from the hard grass.</Sentence> <Sentence>Boots and
all I went and stayed half the day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a glorious time while Hannah
in her bare feet had had to mind the cows.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a mean thing I had
done and what frightened me was that I had entirely forgotten Hannah
and the cows.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been another person in another world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I tried to be fair to Mother, I could see her side of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was
afraid I would fall into bad company and be so fascinated with dancing
I would not know what I was doing; but she was wrong in thinking I
wanted to dance only to be seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was more than that in my
dancing.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the elation of it, the joy, the freedom.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>One little one coughed, and I turned it over.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Mrs. Thorne‚Äôs
baby, and seemed to have a heavy cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>Its little forehead was dewy
with perspiration and I could see she had laid it down with its heavy
wraps on and it was too hot.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loosened its shawls as well as I could.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The other little ones were in their night clothes, and slept
comfortably.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Thorne had no sense about the baby, everyone knew
that.</Sentence> <Sentence>She hadn‚Äôt had a stitch of clothes ready for little June when
she was born for she said she had a feeling the child would not live.</Sentence>
<Sentence>That showed what sort of woman she was.</Sentence> <Sentence>June Thorne, poor little soul,
was a sour baby, never quite clean.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was not very deft in handling a baby, for I had never had any
experience but I wriggled the little thing out of her smothering
clothes some way.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was another smell on her, too, a sickly sweet
smell new to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I noticed it when I was loosening her shawls and I
had wondered about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that there was something that women gave
their babies to make them sleep at times.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had heard it mentioned as
another evidence of the wickedness of dances.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe this was what
smelled on little June‚Äôs breath and made her seem so heavy and
lifeless and her breathing so deep.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It made children stupid when
they grew up, I knew that too.</Sentence> <Sentence>June was a pretty little thing, who
seldom smiled and always had bumps on her forehead, where she had
fallen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I lay down across the bed, watching the light from below stairs
flickering on the new rafters and thought of Mrs. Thorne.</Sentence> <Sentence>It must be
terrible to have a baby you didn‚Äôt want.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I was quite determined
I would never have any‚Äîthough I hoped there would be plenty in our
family for I liked minding a baby and washing its fat little
hands.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>But I might be wild to go to a dance some time, and be
mean enough to give the baby a dose.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>if there was no other way.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother was right.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe she saw I had it in me to be mean like that!</Sentence>
<Sentence>Well I‚Äôd never get married so there would be no danger.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remembered
the picnic I was at the summer before at <Location>Stockton</Location> and how draggled and
tired Kate Simpson was.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had just been married a year, and had a
baby a month old, lying on the seat of the buggy.</Sentence> <Sentence>She couldn‚Äôt come
over to see the baseball game or anything and wasn‚Äôt a bit like
herself.</Sentence> <Sentence>The fun had all gone out of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Babies were all right for
older women who didn‚Äôt care for sports or dances, but it was tough to
have one when you were young.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I was awakened by voices quite near me and lifted my head and saw two
people sitting at the head of the stairs, a man and a woman.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her head
was on his shoulder and his arms were around her.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This was all very thrilling to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Here was Romance just as it had
been pictured in the _Family Herald_, but the scene should have been
in the conservatory or on a bench in the garden over which the trees
obligingly spread their branches.</Sentence> <Sentence>But here it was and near enough for
me to hear the conversation.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not help hearing.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúTake me away Jimmy,‚Äù she was saying, ‚ÄúI hate everything and everybody
here.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can‚Äôt stand it any longer.</Sentence> <Sentence>This country is too hard on women,
with its hard water and awful cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>I have to get away and can be
happy anywhere with you.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would starve with you Jimmy and be happy
but I will go crazy if I have to go on this way.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll be an old woman
before I am twenty-five.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt cry Fay,‚Äù he said soothingly, ‚Äúyou have had it tough and I will
do anything for you that I can.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll never go back on you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fay‚Äî‚ÄîJimmy!</Sentence> <Sentence>It was Jimmy Sloan and Mrs. Thorne!</Sentence> <Sentence>The talk about them
was true!</Sentence> <Sentence>And here she was asking him to run away with her and her a
married woman with a little girl depending on her.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was terrible
and what could I do?</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew an eavesdropper was the lowest thing made.</Sentence>
<Sentence>And yet I could not let Jimmy Sloan go like this.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was too fine a
boy to have his whole life ruined.</Sentence> <Sentence>She probably wanted to get away so
badly she did not care who took her.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I could not lie still and
let this go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was too much like watching the mink robbing the
hen-house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I did not catch all that Jimmy said.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was on the other side of her
and his voice did not carry so well.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I heard her say, ‚ÄúI have money, Jimmy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Six hundred dollars.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dan
gave it to me to keep when he sold his wheat.</Sentence> <Sentence>That will give us a
start.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could feel the change in Jimmy‚Äôs voice and I knew he drew away from
her.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou took Dan‚Äôs money,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou did that!</Sentence> <Sentence>Say what do you think
I am?</Sentence> <Sentence>I would not take you now for anything on earth.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am a good bit
of a fool but I am not a thief.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I took you away now knowing that
you had stolen this money I would never be able to look any decent
person in the face as long as I lived.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, Fay, I will not go with
you.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am done.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut Jimmy,‚Äù she coaxed, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get so mad about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did this for
you more than for myself, because I love you.</Sentence> <Sentence>Any woman will steal for
the one she loves.</Sentence> <Sentence>We will be able to find good jobs and we can pay it
back if we want to.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can go back to where I was in the hotel and I
know lots of people there and they will get you into a dance orchestra
Jimmy and you can study music.</Sentence> <Sentence>And Jimmy, Dan will never tell a soul
that I took this money.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would not let anyone know that for June‚Äôs
sake and he will not follow us or make any sort of a row.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know Dan.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI know him too and he is the squarest and best friend I ever had.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Neither you or I are good enough to blacken his boots.</Sentence> <Sentence>So it is all
off, Fay.</Sentence> <Sentence>Let us forget everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one knows about this and no one
ever need know.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was crazy and so were you but there is no harm
done.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>In her rage she forgot to whisper.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDo you think you can ditch me like
this,‚Äù she cried, ‚ÄúI tell you I am desperate and I am going out of
here if I have to shoot myself.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>And what is there to stop me
from telling Dan that it was your idea to take the money‚Äîhe will
believe my word before anybody‚Äôs.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I despise you anyway for being
so mealy-mouthed about the money.</Sentence> <Sentence>You would steal a man‚Äôs wife but not
his money‚Äîthat is a fine code of morals.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jimmy was unmoved by her fury.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDon‚Äôt be a fool, Fay,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthere is a difference.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I am not
taking either.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am sorry for all this but I can see how it would end.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I could never get along with you.</Sentence> <Sentence>We would be fighting before we got
half way to Brandon.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Someone was coming up the stairs then and they began to talk about
something else.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI just ran up to see how June was,‚Äù Mrs. Thorne said, ‚Äúand Jimmy and
I have been sitting here waiting for her to wake up.</Sentence> <Sentence>She has done well
to sleep all this time.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is not often she sleeps so long.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Gray had come up to see her baby, and as she stooped over the bed
she discovered me.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhy Nellie,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúsound asleep and missing all the fun.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did
that once too when I was about your age and slept until daylight when
the people came up to get their things.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I certainly felt cheated.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Your Mother did not mean for you to stay here all the time.</Sentence> <Sentence>Go down
now and have your cake and sandwiches.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jimmy and Mrs. Thorne had gone down before me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I washed my face at the
washstand and went down stairs yawning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The party was about to break up for a blue dawn was showing through
the windows and dulling the glow of the lamps.</Sentence> <Sentence>The women looked tired
too with the curl coming out of their hair.</Sentence> <Sentence>In an armchair one man was
asleep.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could see by Mother‚Äôs face that she thought the people
should have gone home some time ago, and I wondered why she had not
sent them.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she explained afterwards that this was Will‚Äôs party and
she did not like to step in.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were not children and should know
themselves when it was time to go.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I looked around for Jimmy Sloan.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was putting his fiddle in its case
and looked worried.</Sentence> <Sentence>He saw me too and called out to me that we had not
had our dance, but I shook my head.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no fun in dancing now.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The glamour had gone from everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dirty dishes stood on the
tables, plates with a few sandwiches, and cups half-full of coffee,
with broken bits of cake on the saucers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Upstairs the babies cried and someone was calling loudly, hunting for
one overshoe.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dan Thorne went up and brought June down in a bundle of
shawls.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Thorne said goodnight to Mother and tried to smile when
she said she had had a good time but her mouth seemed to have
stiffened.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou have gone to a lot of trouble, Mrs. Mooney, and it has all been
so pleasant.</Sentence> <Sentence>It gives us a chance to get acquainted.</Sentence> <Sentence>I always feel
like a different woman when I have been to a party.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Her face had the
look of a withered white lily.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the ruby necklace glowed and
gleamed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was glad she had it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The gray dawn was full of shivers and I wanted to go home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Father and
Hannah had gone an hour ago Mother said, and I had better go off too
and get to bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Out in the fresh air of the winter‚Äôs morning I soon
ran the quarter mile.</Sentence> <Sentence>A cheerful column of smoke arose from our
chimney with its assurance of warmth and comfort.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was just like
Hannah to leave the party at exactly the right time and I wished again
that I could be like her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was always right.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would forget all
about Jimmy Sloan and Mrs. Thorne and get back to the safe
complications of King John and the barons and the peaceful atmosphere
of the Wars of the Roses.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>It was in the spring of that year that little June Thorne died and on
the day of the funeral there was a cold snow storm.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember the
smothering smell of wet fur in the front room of the little house
where the neighbors gathered, when in the heat of the big black stove
the snow began to melt on the buffalo and coon coats.</Sentence> <Sentence>The small white
coffin stood on the table surrounded by pots of blooming geraniums
which the women had brought when they came in to clean up the house.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Everyone knew that Mrs. Thorne was no housekeeper.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the women had
scrubbed the floor and made newspaper curtains for the shelves; and
hung clean muslin curtains at the two front windows, put a white
spread on the bed and pillowshams over the pillows.</Sentence> <Sentence>Poor Mrs. Thorne
had no knack for housework and could not make a home if she had all
‚Äúthe wealth of the Indies.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù So I had often heard.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was glad I had not told anyone what I had heard on the night of
Will‚Äôs party.</Sentence> <Sentence>That was all I could do for her and I had done it with a
stupendous effort, for that story would certainly have been a scoop in
our quiet neighborhood, if I had released it and I would have gained a
certain importance too.</Sentence> <Sentence>But something held me back from speech.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
think I held my tongue as a wholesome spiritual exercise but I did
wish that my Mother could know.</Sentence> <Sentence>It would be an eye-opener to her to
see how noble I could be.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she would surely be sorry then for the
time she upheld my brother Jack when he said that my tongue was hung
in the middle and worked both ways.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Little June‚Äôs funeral was one of unrelieved sadness.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her father,
weather-beaten, gray-haired Dan Throne, sat beside the little coffin
and wept uncomforted.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Thorne‚Äôs grief was terrible.</Sentence> <Sentence>She rocked
herself in the rocking-chair crying out that she was a wicked woman
and had never loved little June until now and now it was too late;
that she was not fit to live but was afraid to die.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When Mr. Adams, the minister, came Mother got her to come with her
into the bedroom and the service began.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew Mother would comfort
Mrs. Thorne if anyone could for she had a wonderful way with people
who were sick or in trouble.</Sentence> <Sentence>Just before the coffin was closed Mrs.
Thorne came out of the bedroom quite composed and tearless, and looked
her last on the little white face.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Then suddenly she reached
over and put something on the two little folded hands.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was her ruby
necklace.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXVI‚ÄîThe Family Is Extended</Sentence>


<Sentence>The night my brother Will was married, everyone went to the wedding
but Father and me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think Father would have liked to go, but he
stayed with me, and we had a great evening together.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told me of
fairies that dance on the bogs in their little brown and gold velvet
dresses, and of banshees that come to windows combing their hair, and
crying, before a death in the family, and of his friend Ned Miney who
worked with him in the lumber camp at <Location>Bytown</Location>, a devout Catholic, who
came back to <Location>Bytown</Location> every three months for confession and told his
beads every night and morning, and how all the men respected him, and
hushed their talk, when Ned knelt by his bunk.</Sentence> <Sentence>And of the time he went
with Ned to church, in <Location>Bytown</Location>, and enjoyed the music, so soft and
impressive and the flickering candles on the altar.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut remember,‚Äù he said, when he had finished with his description of
the church service, ‚Äúit was among the Methodists that I learned the
way of life.</Sentence> <Sentence>Religion is more than an emotion or an impulse, it is a
way of living, and I saw the lives of the Methodists, there in <Location>Bytown</Location>,
simple, sincere and godly people, and so I threw in my lot with them.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I‚Äôve wandered from the path, but I‚Äôve always come back.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI went to the Episcopalian church first, when I came out, for I had
been confirmed in the Established Church at home, but I felt strange
with them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got never a handshake, or a kind word, nor even a look,
and me just a lonesome lad of eighteen.</Sentence> <Sentence>The pews were high, and had
names on them, so I felt like an interloper among them, and there they
sat, each one, keeping up his or her dignity.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAt home in <Location>Ireland</Location>, there was always a lot of friendly talk before we
went in, and around the headstones when we came out, and Mr. Jordan
himself, after he took off his cassock, would come down to the door.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But the clergyman in <Location>Bytown</Location> did not seem like a man at all, but just a
high and hollow voice; cantering through the service and cutting in on
the heels of the stragglers, if they gave the responses a little more
slowly than he thought they should.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was just one rigmarole to me
with no worship in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>So when one of the boys took me out to the
Methodist chapel, I stayed, and found them friendly, simple-hearted
people and I loved their hymns.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù And in a few months after that he
joined the Methodist church.</Sentence> <Sentence>The services were held in a home, for
they had no building.</Sentence> <Sentence>And once he heard the Rev.</Sentence> <Sentence>Edgerton Ryerson
there, explaining the trouble about the clergy reserves and the way
the Anglicans were trying to keep all other denominations from having
a share in the great grant of land set apart for all churches in
<Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>He could see, he said, the Anglican tradition of apostolic
succession and special privilege was out of place in a new country
where friendliness and neighborliness were the great needs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We sat up as late as we liked, there being no one to hurry us off to
bed, and I made him his gruel the way he liked it, with a flavoring of
nutmeg, and ate a mug of it myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I brought him the
drawing-knife, and a piece of board to make the shavings for the
morning and I stood on a chair and wound the clock, and brought in the
dog, and took the two cats down to the stable, where they would sit on
the cows‚Äô back all night, very warm and welcome.</Sentence> <Sentence>About twelve o‚Äôclock
I brought in the boot-jack and he removed his boots, leaning on my
shoulder to steady himself.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then he sat down in his carpet slippers,
and asked me to read the ninety-first psalm, and after I read it, he
sat a long time thinking, and the clock‚Äôs tick seemed to grow louder,
until it filled the house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew he was thinking of Will, and wishing him well.</Sentence> <Sentence>He got up and
fixed the fire for the night, putting in some green wood to hold back
the dry from too rapid a burning and filling the oven, to have plenty
of dry wood for the morning, then he told me we had better ‚Äúbe for our
beds‚Äù, for tomorrow was another day.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next morning, when I was on my way to school, Hannah and I went in
to see our new sister-in-law.</Sentence> <Sentence>She and Will were sitting at breakfast,
and she kissed us both, and poured us cups of coffee, ‚ÄúI have a big
pot,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúso there will always be plenty for the two girls on
their way to school.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She had on a plaid dress, green and black, and a
white apron, and she had brought her cat, a lovely yellow one, who lay
asleep in the rocking chair.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a sweet bright spring morning and a patch of warm sunshine
stretched across the bare floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was the fifth of March.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah of course, knew what to say, ‚ÄúWe hope you will like us, Lily,‚Äù
she said, ‚Äúwe know we are going to like you!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went on our way, feeling very happy and much richer.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had two
houses now in our family, instead of one, and another cat, yellow as
amber.</Sentence> <Sentence>Soon after Will‚Äôs marriage, George went to live on his own farm
a mile and a half north of our house, on the bank of a wooded ravine
which ran down to the Souris.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie was married in 1887 to Tom Rae
who had built a frame house across the ravine from George‚Äôs and nearer
the river.</Sentence> <Sentence>These changes saddened mother.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would have been glad to
keep her family under her own roof, all their lives.</Sentence> <Sentence>The women of that
day, seeing their family leave them, foresaw the desolation of an
empty old age.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father was more philosophical.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs the way of the world,‚Äù he would say to comfort her.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúPeople must
expect to see their children branch out and do for themselves.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
should be thankful to see them able to make their own way, and Lizzie
is not far away, and you can still bake and wash for George.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>My new brother-in-law was a Scotch Canadian whose people lived in
Paisley, <Location>Ontario</Location>, and I think his fine Scotch accent did as much as
any other quality to win mother‚Äôs heart.</Sentence>

<Sentence>To George‚Äôs little house, Mother and I went each Saturday afternoon,
to do a little cleaning, and ‚Äútidying‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>We emptied the tea-leaves,
made the bed, scrubbed the floor, and brought his clean clothes;
George‚Äôs house, and his experience with housekeepers formed the
background of a story I wrote years afterwards called _The Runaway
Grandmother_.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXVII‚ÄîHands Across the Sea</Sentence>


<Sentence>There was no unemployment in the West in the eighties.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed, the
problem of help in the harvest fields began to trouble the farmer, and
through the railway company, arrangements were made to bring out men
from <Location>England</Location> and <Location>Scotland</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The procedure of getting a man was simple.</Sentence> <Sentence>You went to the railway
office and put down your name, and agreed to pay to the newcomer, five
dollars a month for the first year, and endeavour to teach him the
rudiments of farming, and the railway, in turn, brought the men and
gave notification of their arrival.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our farm now had a hundred and fifty acres under cultivation and an
extra man could be put to plowing, after the seeding was done.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was still another hundred acres to be broken.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will put down his name
for a man, too, and the <Location>Northfield District</Location> had an allotment of nine
men.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The day the men came to Brandon, the farmers went there to pick their
men.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will got a slim, fair-haired, good-looking man, named Edwin
Guest, but Jack brought home one of the queerest looking Englishman we
had ever seen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was impossible to tell his age; he might be nineteen or
thirty-nine, awkward and big, with a broad face, thick lips, and an
oily shine on his skin.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack‚Äôs explanation was that no one was willing to take him, because of
his looks, and he couldn‚Äôt bear to see the poor fellow‚Äôs feelings
hurt; and he might be a good man at that; a hired man did not have to
have looks.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother supported Jack warmly, and from the first glimpse
of William, liked him.</Sentence> <Sentence>To her, homeliness always made an appeal.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was something steadfast and dependable about homely people removed as
they were from one zone of temptation and William justified all her
hopes; for he combined the strength of <Location>Louis</Location> St. Cyr, the
French-Canadian hero, with the gentleness of a sheep dog.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was never
tired and never out of humor, and after a few weeks we saw we had the
best man of the nine.</Sentence> <Sentence>And besides, William was a Wesleyan, from
<Location>Yorkshire</Location>, from the valley of the Ribble, and among his books were
sermons and lectures by the great <Location>Yorkshire</Location> preachers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The nine Englishmen were quickly assimilated into the life of the
neighborhood and brought many contributions to our quiet life.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
brought us books of all kinds which we would not have had, Kingsley‚Äôs
_Westward <Location>Ho</Location>_, _Evilena_ and Captain Marryat‚Äôs _Phantom Ship_ which I
read until I was afraid to go to bed, loving every word of it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>They introduced us to peaked caps made of tweed in large checks, and
they gave us our first sight of yellow tin trunks.</Sentence> <Sentence>Edwin Guest brought
an accordion, and grafted on the sturdy stalk of our musical
education, from the music halls of <Location>Manchester</Location>, such frivolous blossoms
as _McGee‚Äôs Backyard_ and _It‚Äôs a Great Big Shame_.</Sentence> <Sentence>But Edwin had a
Sunday repertoire too, and introduced into our Sunday School, _Master
the Tempest is Raging_, with fine effect and bewildering variations,
greatly appreciated by his audience.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So it happened in the eighties that the old land and ours met and
profited by their association.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had another element in our neighborhood, too, from over the water.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There came, a few years after our coming a doctor with his family who
took up land across the river, and started his sons in farming.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
establishment, he set up there, belonged not in our times, but to the
shadowy period we call the middle ages.</Sentence> <Sentence>He ruled his small domain with
a heavy hand and brooked no opposition.</Sentence> <Sentence>His wife, a slender little
dark-eyed woman, with a skin as fine as a faded rose leaf, fluttered
about him, in a frenzy of patient solicitude.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sons who were grown
men came in from the fields to receive his directions, and when he did
come forth to personally inspect their operations, the family
followed, at a respectful distance, in silence.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He had not intended to practice medicine; but some one discovered that
he was a medical doctor, and so the needs of the neighborhood pressed
him into service.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had come to <Location>Canada</Location> to get away from sick people,
most of whom he said would be better dead anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why did they hang on
to life, if they believed in heaven?</Sentence> <Sentence>He had some interest, (although a
scornful one) in the land of his adoption, for on occasions he took
his pen in hand, and bitterly denounced the governments of <Location>Canada</Location> in
letters to the newspapers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember one letter of his which appeared
in the Brandon _Sun_ under the caption of ‚ÄúWhat the ignorant farmer
pays for his stupidity‚Äù.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No one resented this, and the old man was regarded with a feeling of
tolerance in the neighborhood, mingled with not a little awe; for he
was an impressive figure when he went abroad, wearing a wide-brimmed
black hat, and a long cape and a flowing Tolstoi beard.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was another Englishman, who came to our neighborhood, as a farm
hand, too, who must be chronicled by me for I owe him a tribute of
affection and gratitude.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He came in a later assignment of farm laborers, and went to the farm
of our nearest neighbor, the Ingrams.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a thin young man called
‚ÄúAlf‚Äù, with a sharp nose, large dark eyes and bushy hair.</Sentence> <Sentence>The family
were all away one day to a picnic leaving Alf at home.</Sentence> <Sentence>When they
returned they heard strange sounds in the house, some one was playing
the piano!</Sentence> <Sentence>They came in on tiptoe, and listened.</Sentence> <Sentence>They knew they were
listening to a great musician.</Sentence> <Sentence>In blue overalls and long boots with
his bushy hair standing straight up, Alf was playing, making his
work-worn hands do his bidding once more.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one spoke or moved.</Sentence> <Sentence>When
he was done he arose and took the applause of an imaginary audience.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Then he saw the family and with an apology went out to do the evening
chores.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI thought I was through with it,‚Äù he told Mrs. Ingram, ‚Äúbut
it got me again.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She urged him to play whenever he felt like it but
it was six months before he did.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When his year was completed, he began to teach music in the
neighborhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>He made his journeys on foot, and in all weathers:
coming regularly on his rounds, a genial, pleasant man, always the
same and always a mystery.</Sentence> <Sentence>He became Professor Grainger at once and
was a privileged person from that day, welcome at every table and
fireside.</Sentence> <Sentence>He wrote no letters and received none.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one ever knew
where he came from though he taught music there for twenty years.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
he gave us a love and understanding of music, and added greatly to the
happiness of our lives.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was always ready to play; and made an
imposing figure at church anniversaries or weddings, when he came
forth in a Prince Albert coat, and top hat.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told me once his life
was divided in periods of twenty years and at the end of twenty years
he would go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>He thought he would go to <Location>California</Location>, he said.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then
having broken all records in that burst of confidence he lapsed into
silence again.</Sentence> <Sentence>He went as silently as he came, like the sparrow that
came into the lighted banquet hall by one window and out by another.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He said good-bye to no one, and has not been heard of since by anyone
of the friends who knew him then.</Sentence>

<Sentence>From William‚Äôs books we read of the great William Dawson, the
<Location>Yorkshire</Location> preacher, whose eloquence had swept many a sinner into the
ways of peace and righteousness.</Sentence> <Sentence>Born on a farm, William Dawson had
done all sorts of hard work, even worked in coal mines, below the sea,
but the hand of God was laid on him when he was eighteen, and wherever
he preached the spirit of God fell on the congregation.</Sentence> <Sentence>We read his
sermons aloud, and I always heard a voice like a rushing wind in his
words.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember one sentence because I wrote it in one of my school
books.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe gospel of humanity, like the gospel of the silent earth,
must begin with the raw material.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I did not understand it, but it
thrilled me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Another supply of reading matter which came to us from the Old Land
was addressed to our farm, ‚ÄúSection 20, Township 7, Range 16‚Äù but
without a name.</Sentence> <Sentence>Periodicals, papers and books came every three months
for years and as there was no trace of the sender, we could make no
acknowledgment.</Sentence> <Sentence>The service went on for ten years.</Sentence> <Sentence>One day there came
a letter from her secretary telling us of the death of Miss M. E.
Breasted at whose request the papers had been sent.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was an invalid
lady of some means, who had used her income to send reading matter to
the settlers of <Location>Western Canada</Location>, choosing one family in each township.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We wrote back, telling of our gratitude, and of how we had passed the
books and papers around to the neighbors, but it has always been a
matter of regret that we had not known of Miss Breasted while she was
living.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXVIII‚ÄîThe First Sorrow</Sentence>


<Sentence>My sister Lizzie‚Äôs first baby died.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She had been out gathering the eggs, and slipped on a loose plank in
the granary, and because of her fall the baby came prematurely, and
lived only five days.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The doctor from <Location>Glenboro</Location>, sixteen miles away, had been brought; and
Mother was there, but nothing could be done.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The loss of the baby was a great grief to Lizzie for she had been very
happy about its coming even though she had not been well all summer.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But she had scalloped white flannel barricoats and embroidered little
dresses, sewed and knitted and told me that she would soon forget all
her ailments when the baby came.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was not so sure.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I felt sorry
that she had to be tied in with a baby.</Sentence> <Sentence>She seemed too young to have
to take up life‚Äôs burdens when she was only twenty-two and have to
stay at home from all the parties and picnics.</Sentence> <Sentence>When a woman had a baby
her good times were over!</Sentence>

<Sentence>But, when I saw the baby‚Äôs sweet little wrinkled face; and heard his
protesting cry, I would have given my heart‚Äôs blood, if it could have
saved him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stayed at home from school and helped with the house-work
and all day long, as I worked in the kitchen that little hurt wail,
like a spring wind mourning in a chimney, cut through me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sometimes he
slept, but even then I heard it through my ears, laying my heart wide
open.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was such a little helpless cry, a complaint against a world
which he had not wanted to enter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One afternoon, when Mrs. Ingram had come to relieve Mother, I went out
to the bank of the ravine behind the house, where no one could see me
cry, and laid my face on the earth‚Äôs cold breast, and tried to make a
bargain with God.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would renounce every ambition I had ever known if
He would let the baby live.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would burn my books, and turn to
household work‚Äîwhich I hated; I would carry the baby in my arms night
and day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would shelter and care for him, and find all the joy of my
life in him if God would let him live.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But the clouds sailed on, wild geese flying south keened above me, a
cold wind shook down dead leaves around me and the hard grass of the
hillside hurt my face.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>When I came back to the house, the stillness of it struck me like a
blow.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew without any one telling me that the little flame of life
had gone out.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom went to <Location>Glenboro</Location>, and brought back a little coffin, covered with
white brocaded velvet; and Mr. Adams, the Methodist minister, came and
read the burial service in the house.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the Millford cemetery there
is still the little green mound, marked with a small white stone, on
which ‚ÄúBaby Rae‚Äù is carved.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was the first of our family to be laid
there.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After Lizzie had recovered, life settled down, and I was back at
school again, sobered somewhat by what had happened; I was not quite
so sure of myself, and not a little afraid.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life might take a snap at
me any time.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of the prairie chickens off their guard, when
they danced their mating dance; easy victims in their one mad
delicious hour.</Sentence> <Sentence>Women were the same and for them life was as
treacherous as ice.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had thought I was strong like Queen Elizabeth
who kept clear of sex complications, but now I could see I was
wavering.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that I would like to have a baby of my own some time.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I had resisted dolls all my life, not without a struggle.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been
scornful of the great trunk full of pillow shams and splashers and
hemstitched sheets that Lily Dewart had all ready.</Sentence> <Sentence>Marriage to me had
a terrible finality about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seemed like the end of all ambition,
and hope and aspiration.</Sentence> <Sentence>And yet I knew now since the baby had come
that a child is greater than all books and all learning and that
little first cry is mightier than the cheers of ten thousand people.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wished very bitterly that I was either one thing or the other; hard
as nails, and able to do without all family connections or as simple
and contented as little Mrs. Billings who had just come to Millford.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She said she had never read a book in her life for after all ‚Äúthey
only take a woman‚Äôs mind off her work and maybe make her
discontented,‚Äù but she did like having a newspaper coming in each week
because there were cooking recipes in it and besides ‚Äúscalloped
newspapers looked nice on the pantry shelves.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Life was a direct and simple thing for the people who knew what they
wanted, I thought, reasoning from the lives of the people I knew.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There was the old man Ferguson who took delight in his potatoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mat
Moggy had trotting horses.</Sentence> <Sentence>Billy Henderson of Brandon was the wit of
the community and played practical jokes which were told and retold by
his friends.</Sentence> <Sentence>Many of the men I knew had the lust for more and more
land and got their thrills out of mere possession.</Sentence> <Sentence>Women had not so
diverse a program.</Sentence> <Sentence>Well, anyway, it seemed that the way to be happy
was to have enough of some one thing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even crazy people could be
gloriously happy if they were very crazy!</Sentence> <Sentence>But not those who have only
a slight derangement.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was fearful of being the sort of person who
had a little of many things and not much of any thing.</Sentence> <Sentence>I tried to get
some light and leading from Milton whose ‚ÄúIl Penseroso‚Äù, ‚ÄúLycidas‚Äù,
and ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAllegro‚Äù were a part of the prescribed literature that year.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
had committed many lines to memory as I walked the two miles, night
and morning, and turned them over in my mind looking for some plan of
life.</Sentence> <Sentence>Best of all I liked the Ode to Mirth with its rollicking metre,
so easy to remember:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúWhere the plowman near at hand
  Whistles o‚Äôer the furrowed land,
    And the milkmaid singeth blithe
    And the mower whets his scythe,
    And every shepherd tells his tale
    Under the hawthorn in the vale,
  Straight mine eyes have caught new treasures
  While the landscape round it measures.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I loved that.</Sentence> <Sentence>But there were times when I wondered how happy the mower
and the milkmaid and the plowman really were, interesting and romantic
as they were to the poet, when he was out for his walk and knew he was
going home to a warm fire and an easy chair and a good meal which some
one had cooked for him.</Sentence> <Sentence>What did he know about them any way?</Sentence> <Sentence>Quite
likely the milkmaid had chapped hands and the shepherd chilblains and
stone-bruises according to the season.</Sentence> <Sentence>And all of them were probably
underpaid and overworked and lived lives of chill stagnation.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I wrote I would write of the people who do the work of the world
and I would write it from their side of the fence, and not from the
external angle of the casual visitor who likes to believe that the
poor are always happy.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXIX‚ÄîWhen the Door Opened</Sentence>


<Sentence>We were getting on.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a new carpet in the front room, full of
scrolls, and flowers of great beauty, but of no known family, bulbous
lilies with spotted leaves like serpents‚Äô tongues; and chintz curtains
on the windows, and real blinds, green with a roller and brass ring to
pull them down instead of the crocheted cord; and the kitchen had been
given another layer of boards, so it could be used all winter; and
Mother had a silk eiderdown on her bed, old gold on one side and
flowered with red geraniums on the other.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even in the face of an abundant crop, the acid little economies of the
household went on, little restrictions which burned into me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Coal-oil
cost money, and was not to be lightly consumed by night-reading after
lessons were done.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was to me the most irritating of all.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lack of
shoe-blacking was another sore point.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lard and lampblack was just as
good, and even if it was more trouble, what of it?</Sentence> <Sentence>We had more time
than money.</Sentence> <Sentence>Better people than we had used it all their lives!</Sentence>

<Sentence>How I hated all this!</Sentence> <Sentence>But in my fiercest moods of rebellion I was glad
of these irritations; they kept alive my ambition.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would make my
escape; I would gain my independence, and every day brought me nearer.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I thought of John Wesley, who, being my father‚Äôs idol, was mine too.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He had a nagging, uncomfortable wife, who gave him no peace at home,
and perhaps that was one reason he give himself so freely to the
world.</Sentence> <Sentence>A soft chair, comfort and domestic calm might have held him to
his own fireside.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I had another grievance too, the last year I was at school.</Sentence> <Sentence>In getting
winter clothes for me, this year, my bloomers were made from mother‚Äôs
old dressing gown, and because mats were indicated, the gown was dyed
before it was made over.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I found myself clad in scarlet bloomers,
and although held in by elastic at the knee, inclined to droop when I
ran.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I raised a mighty storm of opposition for I felt utterly disgraced.</Sentence>
<Sentence>How could I play ‚Äúshinny‚Äù with these flaring outrages showing under my
skirts.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother said I did not need to play ‚Äúshinny.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù That wasn‚Äôt what
I went to school for!</Sentence> <Sentence>I should be glad to have nice heavy comfortable
clothes to keep me warm!</Sentence> <Sentence>No, I didn‚Äôt need the exercise, two miles
night and morning was enough exercise for anyone.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wore them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had to.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I tightened the elastic until it cut into
my legs and left a red mark, each night, above my knees.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I played
no shinny that winter, thereby losing my seniority on the team.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
been third ‚Äúpick.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I sat in the school, nursing this secret scarlet
sorrow.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I got on with my history and literature.</Sentence> <Sentence>So perhaps, as in
the case of John Wesley, the wrath of man was again made to contribute
to the glory of God.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Looking back, I can see how unfair I was to Mother.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was as
ambitious for me as I was for myself, and never begrudged me money for
books or necessary clothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would gladly deny herself to this
end; and she knew how slowly money came, with eggs ten cents a dozen
and butter eighteen.</Sentence> <Sentence>But, with the intolerance of youth, I only knew
that I was being held down with bit and bridle.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My sister Hannah enriched the stream of our family life in many ways
and gave us all many reasons for being proud of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>When she attended
the Normal in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> she did such good work in her teaching that the
Department of Education raised her certificate from grade ‚ÄúB‚Äù to grade
‚ÄúA‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>She brought back with her the Toronto College Song Book with its
mirthful airs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember exactly how she looked when she sat on the organ stool in
her red henrietta cloth dress, made with a poplin which hung down over
the stool, for she was careful not to sit on it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had profited from
Professor Grainger‚Äôs music lessons, and now played the organ for the
church services when Mrs. Merrill was not there.</Sentence> <Sentence>From her, the songs
learned at the Normal spread to Northfield school and we were now
singing the ‚ÄúMarch of the Men of Harlech,‚Äù ‚ÄúInto a Tent Where a Gypsy
Boy Lay,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHail Smiling Moon.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>After the Normal she got a school at Indian Head, west of Brandon,
where she took the train; it was I who drove her the thirty miles and
very proud I was to be trusted with the horse and buggy.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to
stay the night in Brandon where I could perhaps go to a concert or a
theatre but mother forestalled that by telling me I must drive back
five miles on my homeward way and stay at Mrs. Spicer‚Äôs Stopping House
which was a ‚Äúmuch nicer and safer place for a fourteen year old girl
than a city hotel.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>So I did this and still felt very grown-up and happy to be travelling
on my own and paying my way like a seasoned traveller.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Spicer‚Äôs
unpainted and weather-beaten house was a landmark in this part of the
country with its high pitched roof and long windows, and a welcome
sight to the teamsters drawing wheat into the city for Mrs. Spicer
‚Äúset a good table.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She was a tiny little woman with snow-white hair
framing her rosy face, and looked smaller still with her tall children
around her, not one of whom was less than her six feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>But ‚ÄúMa‚Äù was
the head of the house and directed all the outside activities as well.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The morning that I was there sitting at the family table I noticed one
of the sons who came up behind his mother‚Äôs chair and politely waited
until she had finished what she was saying and then he asked in a
subdued voice, ‚ÄúMa, where is the ox-harness?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She told him and
returned to the story she was telling me about the neighbor across the
ravine, who suffered from toothache, when she came to the country ten
years before, when there were no dentists or doctors to pull a tooth,
and at last in desperation she heated a knitting needle red-hot, and
with it killed the nerve in her tooth!</Sentence> . . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh, but she was a caution!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Mrs. Spicer went on.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNothing could stop
her; she got so lonesome once to see a neighbor, she set out one day
carrying the year-old baby and leading her cow, determined to get over
to see Mrs. McVicar, who lived at <Location>Grand Valley</Location>, and when she came to
the river, what did she do but take off her clothes and tie them on
the cow‚Äôs horns and go through the river that was pretty nearly too
deep to wade, and then on the other side, dressed up again and went
on.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>She stayed a week with Mrs. McVicar, and I‚Äôve often heard
them laugh about it.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>People now do not know anything about the
hardships of pioneering, and it‚Äôs fine to see the country
advance.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>But I like to tell young people what courage it took to
come in here and get a foothold.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Everything is soft now for
women to what it used to be.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now you can even buy your bread if you
want to.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hear the bakers in Brandon are going to run a waggon out
this way.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>You wouldn‚Äôt think it would be worth the trouble, for
surely no woman minds baking a batch of bread, though, of course, it
would be a convenience in threshing time.</Sentence> <Sentence>Baker‚Äôs bread is flimsy
stuff though, all whitened and fluffed up with alum, and there‚Äôs no
nourishment in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôd be afraid to eat my fill of it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>In July, 1889, I wrote for my second class certificate in Brandon, in
the old school on <Location>Tenth Street</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>If Hannah had been at home to help me I would have gone more
confidently to this ordeal.</Sentence> <Sentence>The algebra was the worst, and with Hannah
away teaching, I was fearful of the result.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had two new dresses and that helped me meet the waves of this
troublesome world.</Sentence> <Sentence>One was a brown cashmere, with velvet collar, and
lapels, made with a basque and skirt, and the other one was a white
barred muslin with a pink sash.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Ingram had helped Mother to make
it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had pink bows for my hair, too, which I braided in two braids,
and my white straw hat had a pink ribbon that came down at the back
with fish-tail ends.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had two new sets of underwear with Gordon braid
trimmings, and a flounced petticoat of all over embroidery.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack and I drove to Brandon in the buggy, and we took a Miss Freeman
with us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Freeman was a Nova Scotian school teacher from the <Location>Oak
Creek</Location> neighborhood, with dark eyes, and that lovely Halifax way of
speaking which I secretly admired.</Sentence> <Sentence>She seemed to be quite a woman of
the world to me, being as much as twenty-one years old.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Miss Freeman and I shared a room on the top floor of Mrs. Brock‚Äôs
boarding-house on <Location>Eighth Street</Location>, a tall narrow slice of new unpainted
lumber which seemed to have been built to fill in the vacant space
between the two business blocks.</Sentence> <Sentence>The lady proprietor refused to make
any reduction to us for sharing a room.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúOh, no,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthe wear
and tear is just the same; anyways I like to charge my boarders plenty
then I won‚Äôt be begrudgin‚Äô them.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first week of July in that year was as hot as an oven.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had felt
intense heat before, of course, but it was wide-open country heat,
windy heat that dried the sloughs and cracked the ground, but the air
was always fresh and sweet with honest earthy odors.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was worse;
for the air here seemed polluted with perspiring human beings.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
never seen so many people in my life, and I couldn‚Äôt understand the
presence on the streets of idle men, of all ages.</Sentence> <Sentence>Why did they not go
home when they had done their buying?</Sentence> <Sentence>They surely did not all belong
to the city.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The nights were very uncomfortable, for our room up under the roof
grew hotter and hotter, and each morning I seemed to be more fatigued
than when I went to bed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>John D. Hunt, now of <Location>Edmonton</Location>, <Location>Alberta</Location>, was the presiding examiner,
and on Tuesday morning he gladdened us by telling us we had all passed
our geography examination, written the day before, for he had set the
questions and had read the papers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I believed I would make a pass on
everything but algebra, and it did not come until Friday morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On Thursday night I tried to study, but there seemed nothing I could
do.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I tried to resign myself to my fate, thinking of Mary Queen
of Scots, and Anne Boleyn and other beautiful ladies who had gone to
the block ‚Äúevery inch a queen‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>I took off my clothes, put on my white
cotton night dress (long sleeved and high necked), and knelt at the
window with my head on the sill, and prayed for deliverance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Down below on the street came the Salvation Army with their fife and
drum and cymbals.</Sentence> <Sentence>A woman began to sing in a thin clear voice,
piercing through the noises or the street:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúDo not fear the gathering clouds of sorrow,
    Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
  Are you anxious what will be tomorrow,
    Tell it to Jesus alone!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then the chorus joined her with all their instruments.</Sentence> <Sentence>Was I anxious?</Sentence>
<Sentence>I was.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was more than anxious, I was desperate, but as they sang on I
was conscious of a stream of comfort and assurance coming to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
grew calmer and, strange to say, cooler.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would do my best.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I
had done my best.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I had wrestled with my algebra as Jacob with
the angel, and now if I perished, I perished!</Sentence> <Sentence>I fell asleep with my
head on the sill.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day came the algebra test, and I spent the three hours on it.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It was terrible.</Sentence> <Sentence>So many questions contained words I had never heard.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But I worked on and on, and did not turn in my paper until I heard the
sound of the bell.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were nine of us writing and we met on the steps when all was
over, and held a post-mortem on the paper.</Sentence> <Sentence>John R. Gregg, now a lawyer
in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, had the only smiling face at the meeting.</Sentence> <Sentence>John R. had
written exams before and could look any problem in algebra in the
face.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had the answers written on his paper and he passed it around.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I saw I had three right‚Äîbut I handed the paper back to him before
looking at any more.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were ten questions and forty per cent, was
a pass.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not want to cut the last string of hope.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I wanted
to be able to think I had passed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bob Naismith was in the other room writing, and when I came down the
steps and met him coming out I could see he was feeling low in his
mind too.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had been writing his literature test.</Sentence> <Sentence>Neither of us felt
like eating so we walked around to the Trotters‚Äô livery stable and got
his horse and buggy, and we drove out in the country a few miles.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
had only one more exam, ‚ÄúWriting‚Äù, at three o‚Äôclock that afternoon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The air was a little cooler, and the country was beautiful with wild
roses and tiger lilies, while the air carried the scent of mown hay
and sweet grass and wild clover.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cattle on the meadows looked
peaceful and secure, untouched by fear or failure.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had never seen
much in a cow‚Äôs life before, but that day, still stinging from the
blows of the algebra paper, I envied them with a deep and earnest
envy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I told Bob about the Salvation Army the night before, and how sure I
was that the hosts of heaven would be with me, just as they were round
about Elisha and his young man at <Location>Dothan</Location>; and how I had slept without
fear, and gone into the room to write like a conqueror.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But that paper!</Sentence> <Sentence>with its unknown terms; God had nothing to do with
setting that paper‚Äîand the killing part of it was that these problems
would be simple enough if I had known what they meant.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Schultz had
worked so hard to get me through, too.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and I had perished for
lack of some little insignificant bits of knowledge.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Bob contended that he could not believe that I had failed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even if I
had gone low in algebra, I would have such good marks in the other
subjects that they would not hold me back.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAnyway‚Äù, he said, waving his hand to indicate the countryside,
‚Äúexaminations are not everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Look out there.</Sentence> <Sentence>Look at that field
of wheat rising and bending before the wind.</Sentence> <Sentence>You don‚Äôt have to pass an
examination to enjoy that.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>If I fail, and I think the literature
today finished me, I am going to raise the best horses in the country,
big bays with three white feet and a star on the forehead.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI know,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôll do it too, Bob.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôll get married and have
a happy home, and be the secretary of the school district and go on
just like your father, with everyone coming to you for advice, and
depending on you.</Sentence> <Sentence>Your life is cut out for you, Bob, it lies straight
ahead, but mine isn‚Äôt.</Sentence> <Sentence>I will never get married.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôm going to be like
Queen Elizabeth and keep clear of entanglements because I have work to
do that I can‚Äôt refuse.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life is easy for you, Bob‚Äîyou will be all
right even, if you do fail.</Sentence> <Sentence>You wouldn‚Äôt teach long anyway, for your
heart is in the farm.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I want to get a toe-hold on the ladder of
literature.</Sentence> <Sentence>This exam is the first step, if I get this I can go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
I have failed, what will I do?</Sentence> <Sentence>I could come to Brandon and work for my
board and go to the Collegiate, but I am not smart around the house.</Sentence>
<Sentence>No one would keep me: I‚Äôm not like Hannah or Lizzie who can do two
things at once.</Sentence> <Sentence>They can work and go on thinking, but I stop
working.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>No one would keep me.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I have something in me that
will not let me rest.</Sentence> <Sentence>I want to give people release from their drab
lives!</Sentence> <Sentence>This is not all of the life‚Äîthis sowing and reaping, cooking
and washing dishes.</Sentence> <Sentence>There is an inner life that can be deepened and
widened.</Sentence> <Sentence>Frank Kinley has it.</Sentence> <Sentence>So has Mrs. Kinley, it keeps that little
flickering smile on her face when her body is ground with pain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Milton
had it, and so overcame his blindness.</Sentence> <Sentence>I caught glimpses of it in his
poems and I want to pass it on.</Sentence> <Sentence>Listen to this, Bob, and see if it
does not make you shiver with its beauty.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wish you had been taking
‚ÄòLycidas‚Äô with me all year; that literature you had is dull stuff.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Lycidas had been drowned and Milton is mourning for him, but not
without hope, for he knows Lycidas will live again, but see how he
says it:</Sentence>

  <Sentence>Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,
  For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead:
  Sunk tho‚Äô he be beneath the watery floor
  So sinks the day-star in his ocean bed
  And yet anon, repairs his drooping head
    And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore
    Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThere‚Äôs comfort in that, and healing.</Sentence> <Sentence>That last line, ‚ÄòFlames in the
forehead of the morning sky‚Äô, changed something in me.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I want to
know more and more, and so be able to lift the burden from people.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
can‚Äôt change the facts of life.</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs sorrow and sickness and death,
binders break and horses get cut in barbed wire, but these things can
be softened and brightened and lifted if we have a wide enough
outlook.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúI like you, Bob,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbecause I can always talk to you and tell
you things which lots of people would think were crazy.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wheat farmers
are so intent on raising wheat they have no time to watch the sunset
or raise flowers, plant trees, or do anything to make their homes
beautiful.</Sentence> <Sentence>Beauty has a power to heal and comfort people and help them
over the rough places in life.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Spicer told me she had a bed of
pansies in the first year she was in the country, and they kept up her
spirits.</Sentence> <Sentence>But so many people have nothing to look forward to, or take
delight in.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou know how the McFaddens live‚Äîthey haven‚Äôt spoken for ten
years‚Äîquarrelled over something, and froze; and take a pride in their
silence.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>narrow, single-track minds, with no outlet‚Äîprisoners of
silence and temper; and the poor little boys are living in that
atmosphere, which is about as healthy as a dark cellar.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúI think about these things and I want to help.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>But I have no
confidence in myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt talk to most people, even if they
would listen.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I would freeze over, too.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and all my bright
vision would fade.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I think if I can get through now, go to the
Normal, get away and teach, learning all the time and getting older,
maybe people will listen to me, especially strangers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am afraid I
shall always be an upstart to my own people, though.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>They can‚Äôt
forget how I ran away with the boots, and left Hannah to mind the
cows.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then they lost faith in me over my story of seeing a green wolf
on the school section.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNever mind, Nellie,‚Äù Bob said soothingly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI believe you saw a green
wolf.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are no green wolves, but if you say you saw one, I‚Äôll
swear you did.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I felt better after this, and when we drove back to the city and went
into a confectionery and had two dishes of ice-cream with fruit
biscuits the world had grown in brightness.</Sentence> <Sentence>That was my first taste of
ice-cream, and it came at a time when not only my throat was dry, but
my heart had been scalded by that terrible algebra paper.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day, Saturday, I drove home with Bob.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember what a
lovely day it was, and how I wished the road were twice as long.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
country side was lush and green, with fields of grain in the shot
blade; cattle on the meadows, wild ducks on the ponds, haymakers
cutting around the sloughs, groves of poplar trees turning over their
coin-like leaves, and all the brilliant flowers of July, gaillardia,
golden rod and wild columbine in full bloom.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a sublime world through which we travelled that day, a world of
abundance and sunshine, beauty and hope.</Sentence> <Sentence>I liked to remember it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We talked about ex-premier Norquay who had just died, and we hoped his
enemies were sorry for what they had done accusing him of playing fast
and loose with the <Location>Manitoba</Location> <Location>Central Railroad</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had tried to get it
for us, and done his best with the Government at <Location>Ottawa</Location>, but his own
followers had turned on him and broken his heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>Oh well, God would
know how it was; and wipe out all his bitterness.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was an old man
anyway‚Äîhe would be glad to have a rest.</Sentence> <Sentence>So we thought of him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was
forty-seven, but between fifteen and forty-seven there is a great gulf
of years.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We would not hear the results of the examination until August.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I
announced that I was afraid I had gone down in algebra, Mother was
very philosophical about it.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybe it will be a good thing for you if
you have failed,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre younger for your years than
Hannah, and it will be just as well for you to be at home another
year.</Sentence> <Sentence>You can go on studying here, and it maybe will do you no harm to
have a little of the conceit taken out of you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I protested at that.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was not conceited, I said.</Sentence> <Sentence>Did she really think
I was conceited?</Sentence> <Sentence>She was shaping loaves of bread for the oven, and
stopped for a moment to settle this fine psychological question.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think you are‚Äù, she said at last, ‚Äúbut you are very
impulsive and talk too much for a young girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the world will
smooth you down, Nellie.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs a great teacher.</Sentence> <Sentence>The winds of the world
shape us all.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôre like the pebbles in the ocean that the waves move
and turn and buffet until they are smooth.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs not always pleasant,
but we have to take it and it‚Äôs good for us.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah came home that summer from Kenlis and the summer was delightful
in spite of my anxiety.</Sentence> <Sentence>The crop was coming along with a promise of
being the best we had ever had.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father believed money could be made
on fifty cent wheat, and it would be that much any way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Life for me now had resolved itself into one question: had I passed?</Sentence>
<Sentence>If I had, I could go to the Normal.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother would buy me a new coat and
cardigans, and I had three dresses.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah‚Äôs books would do for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>If
I failed I would have to get to Brandon for a few months at the end of
the term, and try again.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hated the thought of working for my board!</Sentence>
<Sentence>not that I minded the work, but I had no confidence in my ability.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I alternated between the two moods.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I thought I had passed I
radiated goodwill to all the world; washed dishes with great
heartiness, singing as I worked; looked affectionately on the house
and farmyard, even sentimentally; now that I was about to leave
it.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>But in my moments of discouragement, how I hated the work in its
endless circle; carrying water in and out; pulling lambs-quarters for
the pigs; feeding the hens, peeling potatoes, weeding the garden.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not
one part of the work had any permanence; it all had to be done over
and over.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was drawing near the fatal day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would soon know.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had gone to
Millford alone that Saturday for the mail and groceries, driving our
gray pony in the buggy.</Sentence> <Sentence>The examination reports might be out.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My heart was beating into my throat when I went into Mr. Errett‚Äôs
store, which was also the post-office; and I did my buying first, the
nails, sugar, tobacco for the men, tea and pepper, before asking for
the mail.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had failed I would know soon enough.</Sentence> <Sentence>I saw Mr. Errett
going in behind the rack where the mail was kept.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNothing for your people today, Nellie, but a postcard.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I took it
from him and caught the address, Miss Nellie L. Mooney.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I read
the sweetest words I had ever seen on paper: ‚ÄúHaving passed the recent
Second Class Teachers‚Äô Examination, you are eligible to attend the
September to February session of the Normal School at <Location>Winnipeg</Location>,
etc. .</Sentence> . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The road was paved with gold and every clump of silver willow burned
with fire as I drove up from Millford.</Sentence> <Sentence>God had heard my prayer.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Salvation Army was right.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had cleared the first hurdle and was out
in the open.</Sentence> <Sentence>Let the winds of the world blow now, let the hurricane
roar.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would meet them with my head up!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The countryside that day as I came home, is etched on my memory.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now
that I was about to leave it, it became very precious to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I
had climbed the long grade of <Location>Oak Creek</Location>‚Äôs bank, and came up to the
open country, rich now with the burning colors of harvest, James
Duffields‚Äôs house lay on my right, a tall bare house sitting on the
edge of the hill, with a drop to the river below; a sad looking house,
with drawn blinds.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then when I turned south I passed Arthur Binder‚Äôs
scattered buildings; poor Arthur who loved his horses so, and even
then saw their final defeat by machinery, and mourned it bitterly.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Beyond, to the west, were Tom Ailsby‚Äôs house, my brother George‚Äôs, and
still farther, now a tiny speck against the horizon, was my sister
Lizzie‚Äôs little new house, the pinkness of its raw lumber dulled a bit
by its two years of wind and weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>The houses all looked very small
in the great expanse of prairie, brave little outposts, fortifications
against winter‚Äôs cold and summer‚Äôs heat.</Sentence> <Sentence>I loved them all, and all the
people who lived in them, with their sore problems, their
disappointments and strivings.</Sentence> <Sentence>In my new expansiveness I vowed I would
not forget them when I came into my kingdom.</Sentence> <Sentence>The grand mood was on me
and I wanted to do something for my people here.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Everything about these farms had a demanding look, a clamorous,
imperative voice.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cows coming up to the bars to be milked, pigs
squealing in their pens, hens stepping up to the door to see what was
causing the delay in their feeding time, men working in the fields,
getting hungrier every minute.</Sentence> <Sentence>And it was the women who were
responsible for everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>They must bake bread and peel potatoes for
the men, pull pig-weed for the pigs, boil wheat for the hens, and save
the crusts and the peelings for them, milk the cows, keep everything
clean, and raise a family in their spare time.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I drove in to see Lizzie; I must tell her the great news.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI am so glad, Nellie,‚Äù she said in her generous way, ‚Äúbut you deserve
to succeed.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It will be bare without you, you have always meant a
lot to me.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>There is something tragic about a family scattering,
one is taken and the other is left.</Sentence> <Sentence>You and Hannah are away now, we
shall see you only in the holidays.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She looked pathetically young as she stood in her little house with
its bare scrubbed floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lizzie was always an immaculate housekeeper
and loved pretty things.</Sentence> <Sentence>That little square front room with its three
windows hung with white muslin curtains; the black cookstove set on a
square of galvanized zinc, the rocking chair with its log cabin
cushion, the bedroom beyond, with a chintz covered box-seat, the
little footstool made of seven tomato cans, the home-made dresser with
a mirror hung above, the home-made mat.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I wondered if it
satisfied her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course all farm houses are built on the hope that
some day beautiful houses of many rooms will be built and life will be
easier.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every woman has that hope at the very core of her heart.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wondered if this little house felt like a prison to Lizzie as it
would to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew she would miss me but I would write often and send
her books and magazines when I began to earn money.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I reached home I found the peaceful waters of our domestic life
stirred to its depth by the loss of a monkey wrench, and I had been
the last person seen with it.</Sentence> <Sentence>My return had been eagerly awaited; the
delay in my return commented on.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seems the whole family activity
was held up by the absence of the monkey wrench.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got out of the
buggy feeling my exaltation leaving me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was deflating like a
punctured balloon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had been using the monkey wrench to tighten the nuts on the buggy
before I left and had carelessly left it in the buggy and so took it
with me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was in wrong with everyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was almost as bad as the
time I had absconded with the boots.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were uncomplimentary
prophecies made concerning my future, the shortness of my term at any
school.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Knowing what I did, I made no reply to anything, no defence.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hour
of my deliverance was at hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could afford to be silent.</Sentence> <Sentence>And
besides I was sorry about taking the wrench with me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I unhitched the pony and put away the buggy without a word, and I
could see my silence was disconcerting, I had both Mother and Jack
wondering.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I took the pails and went out to milk, still wrapped in this mantle of
silence.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, I had not eaten at Lizzie‚Äôs, but I was not hungry.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
would get something after the work was done.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was pleasant to be out in the pasture with the cows.</Sentence> <Sentence>My people
would be sorry for the things they had said when I was gone.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the
moment I was pretty sure I would never come back.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would send a box
of monkey wrenches instead.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother and Jack were going to make it very
easy for me to leave.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I would tell them so, I would tell them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now
that I was independent of them.</Sentence> <Sentence>The years of bondage were coming to an
end, and not a minute too soon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would have my liberty.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even if I had
to go out and work for the money to take me to Normal.</Sentence> <Sentence>Liberty!</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I
longed in that stormy hour for liberty.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted out.</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>Äú‚ÄôTis liberty alone that gives the flower of fleeting life its
  lustre and perfume,
  And we are weeds without it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remembered that from Cowper‚Äôs ‚ÄúTask.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I finished milking the last cow and was walking into the milk
house, Jack came out of the kitchen.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped I looked pale and wan.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
tried to wear a sad proud look.</Sentence> <Sentence>He sat on the step of the milk house
door as I strained the milk.</Sentence> <Sentence>Neither of us spoke.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then he burst out,
‚ÄúSay, kid, did you fail?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I worked on for a few seconds without
speaking.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I could give him a few bad moments, I would.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My silence frightened him, he thought I was crying.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNever mind,
Nellie,‚Äù he said, in a voice that was new to me, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take it so
hard.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre young, and remember this, you have the education.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one
can take that from you; you‚Äôre better off than I am.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I was
always too ready to work and pretended I did not care about going to
school.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be a man, drive horses, team out the grain, but I
did care.</Sentence> <Sentence>At least I care now.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve been a big fool in some ways.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went over to him and sat down on the step beside him.</Sentence> <Sentence>In that moment
every bit of resentment I had ever felt against him passed away, never
to return.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúJack,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI was just acting mad about the monkey wrench and I‚Äôm
sorry I took it, and I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been so ‚Äòlippy‚Äô with you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I
couldn‚Äôt think of any other word.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou and I will get on better now.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
always thought you were picking on me.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>You‚Äôre only twenty, Jack,
and lots of people who knew nothing at all have educated themselves
after that.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre smart too, and there is not a boy in the country
who can hold a candle to you for good looks.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He shook his head sadly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThere is always something to do on a farm if
you‚Äôre willing to do it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve been too willing.</Sentence> <Sentence>You were blessed by
having a saving streak of laziness.</Sentence> <Sentence>You wouldn‚Äôt piece quilts or
crochet, or knit, and you raised a row when you had to stay at home
from school, but I hopped in and did a man‚Äôs work since I was
fourteen.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be a big fellow.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be praised for my
strength and hardiness.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to face the wind and show that I did
not care if my ears did freeze.</Sentence> <Sentence>Going to school was too tame for me
after teaming wheat to Brandon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôm not blaming anyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was stubborn
and wanted my own way, and, unfortunately, got it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We talked on and on.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never knew Jack until that night.</Sentence> <Sentence>I should have
finished straining the milk for it was cooling in the pails, and the
cream was rising, but neither of us thought about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Something more
precious than cream was rising in our hearts, a mutual respect,
friendship and understanding that has travelled with us down the
years.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The frost came early that year and crushed the crop beneath its iron
heel.</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be cattle-feed in plenty but not much grain that
could be sold, and there would be very little money after the bills
were paid.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not expect to go to Normal now, and my heart was
heavy; a year is so long at fifteen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But Hannah had money and came forward with an offer to finance me; and
Lizzie, too, came to my aid in the matter of clothes, and by September
the first I was away.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The train from <Location>Glenboro</Location> left at five o‚Äôclock in the morning, having a
long one hundred and thirty miles to travel before night to reach
<Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>In order to be on the station platform in time, I went to
<Location>Glenboro</Location> the night before and stayed with Emily Bell, at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. R. S. Thompson.</Sentence> <Sentence>Emily who now lives in <Location>San Francisco</Location>, had
gone to Northfield School for two years and had been my blithe
companion on the two-mile walk night and morning; and I knew she would
share her bed with me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Emily was a lovely blonde with braids of golden
hair, white even teeth, and a lilting laugh.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I don‚Äôt know whether Emily and the Thompson family were informed of
the fact that they were going to have a visitor or not.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I can
remember their friendly welcome, and that Emily and I talked until the
roosters began to crow.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Thompson had been the Liberal member of the local legislature for
years, not from any help given by the voting members of our family,
and from that fact came my first conviction that women should vote.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Opposing Mr. Thompson seven years before was a young lawyer from
<Location>Winnipeg</Location>, whom we had not seen until he came out electioneering.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
brother Will, who was an ardent Conservative, drove him around to the
meetings and spoke for him too.</Sentence> <Sentence>But my mother was against the young
city man and openly hoped for Mr. Thompson‚Äôs election.</Sentence> <Sentence>This led to
much stormy argument and one day when the conversation was heated and
loud, I tried to find a basis of agreement by telling my mother that
she and Lizzie could vote for Mr. Thompson anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was then I heard
the bad news that women could not vote at all.</Sentence> <Sentence>No woman anywhere; and
I knew there was something wrong about that, and said so until I was
compelled to hush my talk.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>At five in the morning I began my all day journey to the city; a
glorious day for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was dressed in a green cloth dress with brass
buttons and bound with black military braid; I had money (carefully
sewed into my chemise) to pay a month‚Äôs board bill and buy books; fine
new goatskin buttoned boots on my feet, black cashmere stockings, a
crocheted petticoat blue and yellow in a V-pattern, with a white one
over it and kid gloves on my hands.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a coat of dark grey heavy
cloth with a high storm collar and lapels that would button over,
lined with red flannel, and a home-made red and black ‚Äúcloud‚Äù to wear
in the cold weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I found that most of the girls at the Normal
had fur collars on their coats I grew very much ashamed of my ‚Äúcloud‚Äù
and did not wear it until both ears had been frozen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The long day on the train was a delightful experience, full of new
scenes; little towns of bright new lumber and once in a while a great
red water-tank running over; long stops at each of the towns when the
conductor went into the station to see the agent.</Sentence> <Sentence>We could see them
through the window.</Sentence> <Sentence>The train carried the freight too, being of the
kind known as ‚ÄúMixed.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù So there were pigs to be loaded and cattle, and
the length of the train grew as the day went on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was strange to see how many idle men there were around the
stations, the platform swarmed with them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not know that I was
looking at the solid citizens of the little towns, who had come over
to see the train come in, and who counted this time well spent.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
postmaster walked apart with his canvas bag of mail, and sometimes
someone brought a letter down and handed it to the mail clerk, and I
wondered what the postmaster thought of that.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At <Location>Elm Creek</Location> we went back on the spur line to Carman, and after
picking up the exports from Carman, came back to the main line.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
country we journeyed through had low-lying marshes and monotonous
levels.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not one part of this country seemed to me as interesting as
our grove-dotted prairie with its encircling hills, and again I
thought of my brother Will‚Äôs good judgment when he made the choice.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think it was dark when we reached the city, but I was again in an
exalted mood.</Sentence> <Sentence>The brakeman had talked to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Came right over and sat
opposite me; a handsome man with a black moustache and beautiful eyes.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He said I was young to be going to Normal and that I would be
homesick.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of the ‚Äúdark man‚Äù in ‚ÄúMeadow Brook,‚Äù whose
clear-cut, noble yet sad face seen on a train changed the whole life
of the heroine.</Sentence> <Sentence>Suitors came and went, but her heart remained
steadfast to her ideal.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if he looked like Mr. Thompson, the
brakeman.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Of course I was not looking for a handsome face in the crowd or
anywhere, nor was I ever going to fall in love.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was pursuing
knowledge and believed I could do this only with a single mind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went to board with a family from Owen Sound, consisting of the
father and mother and two boys younger than I. There was a grown-up
daughter but she had gone to <Location>Vancouver</Location> and I had her room.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was with
some misgiving on the part of the mother that I was let into this
sanctuary where everything had a drape or a bow of ribbon.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou know Margery is so feminine,‚Äù she said, when she conducted me
upstairs, ‚Äúand so beautiful, really Nellie such beauty is an
embarrassment to a girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>Men fall in love with Margery at first sight;
she can‚Äôt go out but some man follows her.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I expressed my wonder and sympathy.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOh, but she will make a brilliant match, I know.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs her eyes, they
shine like stars; you will be careful of her things; nearly everything
here is a present.</Sentence> <Sentence>One young boy in a bank got wrong in his accounts
just because he would buy her a necklace‚Äîwasn‚Äôt it a pity, the
foolish, foolish lad.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIs he in jail?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked, much more interested in the boy than in the
irresistible Margery.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHis father came to his assistance,‚Äù she replied somewhat stiffly.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew she did not like the direction of our conversation.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMy, but you
are like your Mother, Nellie,‚Äù she said somewhat brusquely, ‚Äúin manner
more than in face.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI hope I am like her in some ways,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suddenly realized that
mother would never rave over a daughter‚Äôs beauty or her conquests,
even if one of us had been a raging beauty, carrying scalps at her
belt, and I was grateful to her for her good hard sense.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought
about the deluded boy in the bank, and again saw what a curse love
was.</Sentence> <Sentence>Men could suffer too; that was another aspect of the prairie
chicken dance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we went out together my landlady often pointed out to me
Margery‚Äôs disappointed suitors.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDo you see that man in the buggy there Nellie, yes, with the beard.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He wanted Margery to elope with him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told her he would give up
everything for her.</Sentence> <Sentence>He is a great surgeon here.</Sentence> <Sentence>He begged her, on
bended knee, to fly with him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yes, he‚Äôs married and has a family.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
is terrible.</Sentence> <Sentence>My heart aches for him.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Don‚Äôt look at him now, he
might see us.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I‚Äôm afraid sometimes he may do something
desperate.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The bearded gentleman, driving by, did not look to me like a
broken-hearted swain but I soon learned that these thrilling romances
of Margery‚Äôs conquests were Mrs. C‚Äî‚Äî‚Äôs golden stairs to paradise.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
did not know anything about the psychology of release but I knew that
the glamorous Margery, and the prospect that she might make a
brilliant marriage which would lift the family fortunes, tided her
mother over the bleak places in her own life, and they were many.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So I am glad to remember that I took the stories without asking
upsetting questions.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew there was a pathetic background in her
vain imaginings, as there was in Mrs. Burnett‚Äôs little song to her
children of ‚ÄúGrandpa will come with the wo-wo.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXX‚ÄîWinnipeg in 1889</Sentence>


<Sentence>The Normal was held in the Stobart Block on <Location>Portage Avenue</Location>, one flight
up.</Sentence> <Sentence>We made our way through an unheated warehouse where furniture was
stored, lovely chairs, couches, and a whole library bearing the
nameplate of ‚ÄúBrydges.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was the youngest person at Normal except a bright-eyed, red-cheeked
Icelandic girl, named Buarg Buargson, who knew but little English.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
had been in <Location>Canada</Location> only six months but made such rapid progress that
before the Normal term was over, prepared and read a paper on <Location>Iceland</Location>,
that held our close attention for an hour.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Normal had two rooms; I was in the larger room where the second
class students received instruction from Mr. W. A. McIntyre, though
the Principal, Mr. Goggin gave us logic and talks on deportment.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
days I spent there, five months was the term, were days of pure
delight.</Sentence> <Sentence>New books on psychology, history of education, school
management and other aspects of the profession of teaching, all
smelling delightfully of new paper and ink, were carried by me back
and forth in a new leather bag, and studied with rapture.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We would not be sent to the schools for two months, but classes came
in and we saw model lessons taught; and the days went by so quickly I
dreaded the end.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was learning, I could see my horizon widening.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
was learning how to think.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had debates every week and memory gems
every day, and these we wrote in a book in our best writing.</Sentence> (<Sentence>This
book is still one of my treasures.</Sentence>)

<Sentence>When we were sent to the schools, Margaret Neilson and I were paired
off, and we stood against the wall for two weeks observing and going
from school to school.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember the dull acrid smell of these rooms,
chalk, carbonic acid, onions, and unwashed humanity; but I did not
mind it then.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was part of this new life that I had been permitted
to enter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Miss Nimmons, who taught Grade Two in the Carleton became my ideal,
with her lovely gray eyes, soft brown hair and beautiful dresses.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
must have read the dog-like devotion in my eyes, for she invited me to
dinner one night to the big stone house on the river-bank.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Agnes Laut had gone to the Normal the year before and was teaching in
the Carleton School, too, and one of the first lessons I taught was in
her room.</Sentence> <Sentence>Such perfect discipline I had not seen.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think her pupils
adored her.</Sentence> <Sentence>And when near the end of a term, I was sent to substitute
in her room, I had three happy days.</Sentence> <Sentence>The sickness of a teacher became
the opportunity of a Normal student; and three dollars a day was
wealth to us.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got many days in this way.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suppose Mr. Goggin gave
me the work because I was one of the few students who were boarding.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The others lived at home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My greatest humiliation at this time was my lack of knowledge.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
read so little and the others seemed to have read everything.</Sentence> <Sentence>When
they talked of D‚ÄôArtigan, Charlemagne, Ivanhoe and Sairy Gamp, I had
to sit silent and ashamed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At lunch time they all went home except Ellen Walker and myself.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Ellen, who was one of the First-Class Students, and the daughter of an
alderman, did what she could for me, pitying my dark estate.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ellen
also shared her lunch with me and gave me my first sight and taste of
celery.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew about it, but just as a word.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was in the list of
Vegetables in the Spelling book.</Sentence> <Sentence>The taste of celery still brings back
that upstairs room and my sense of having entered a new world of
bewildering fascination.</Sentence>

<Sentence><Location>Main Street</Location> in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> was a gay and exciting spectacle on Saturday
nights in the winter, with the clip-clop of the horse‚Äôs feet, the
passing street cars, horse-drawn, their windows all alight and the
radiance of the shop windows lighted by great coal-oil hanging lamps.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The drug store windows with their showbottles, green and gold and red,
always drew my astonished gaze; I liked to believe they were costly
jewels and not just glass bottles filled with colored water.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then there were barber poles like great candy sticks, turning and
winding their red and white stripes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Best of all was the thrill of
seeing the aristocracy driving by, brown buffalo robes with red
flannel scalloped edges thrown over the backs of their cutters, and a
driver on a high seat with a round cap of fur, his fur coat fastened
with snaps and straps like a bit of harness, the silver sleigh bells
jingling melodiously as they passed.</Sentence> <Sentence>We sometimes saw the passengers
alight, and got glimpses of party dresses held up daintily, showing
fur boots on little feet.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We often went into Richardson‚Äôs book store to get warm at the big
heater, where a good fire glowed behind the sheets of mica, and there
was always plenty to feast our eyes on there; the sheet music strung
across on a wire, riding horizontally but showing, when we held our
heads sideways, lovely ladies at pianos with young men in tail coats
bending gracefully over them, and yellow moons rising over snowy
mountains, and summer scenes where boats glided under bending willows
and ladies with great flower-laden hats, trailing white hands through
the blue water.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then the books!</Sentence> <Sentence>tables full of them, shelves bursting
with them; Pansy and Elsie books, and the Leather Stocking tales, and
sets of Dickens and Scott and Balzac and Ouida.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My only comfort in looking at such wealth was that some day I would be
able to buy them all.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Just before Christmas I did buy ‚ÄúThe Traits and Stories of the Irish
Peasantry,‚Äù by Will Carleton, and brought it home for my father, who
loved every page of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had had a day‚Äôs substituting and so was in
funds.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was not wishing any harm to the Winnipeg School Staff, but,
if the Lord, in His wisdom, should see fit to lay one of them on a bed
of languishing, and Mr. Goggin would send me to teach in her place, I
would return to this house of enchantment and buy more.</Sentence> <Sentence>By the laying
low of <Location>Miss Hill</Location>, with mumps, I was able to add Edward Bellamy‚Äôs
‚ÄúLooking Backward‚Äù and ‚ÄúTwenty Leagues under the Sea‚Äù together with
Longfellow‚Äôs poems to my small store.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was hoping <Location>Miss Hill</Location> would
have her mumps first in one jaw and then in the other, but she took a
short turn on me and got it all over at once, and so I got only two
days out of it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had a picture taken one night coming home from the Normal, Helen B.
Bishop, Belle Poole, Helen Cawston and myself, a tin type.</Sentence> <Sentence>We carried
our books to show that we belonged to the literati.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Some of the older girls had beaux and talked about them to each other
with much high-pitched laughter, which sounded very foolish and
undignified to me; I believed that all affairs of the heart should be
embalmed in decent silence.</Sentence> <Sentence>One of the girls had an unrequited passion
for Mr. McIntyre, our teacher, and wrote verses to him in school
hours.</Sentence> <Sentence>I sat near her, and she often showed them to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some of the
girls laughed about her; but it was all terrible to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>She told me
she would gladly die if she thought he would come and drop one tear on
her dead face.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Years afterwards, I met her at the <Location>Winnipeg</Location>
Exhibition, a portly young matron standing beside the merry-go-round
on which three of her children were riding.</Sentence> <Sentence>I took it for granted that
she had recovered.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did not speak of it; we discussed the relative
merits of Steedman‚Äôs and Steadman‚Äôs teething powders.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Goggin‚Äôs talks to us on Friday afternoons must have been miracles
of tact and truth.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can‚Äôt remember how he did it, but I know he
inspired us with a love for the English language, pure and undefiled,
a desire to walk with dignity and grace; to love righteousness and
eschew evil, even the appearance of evil, and to dignify our
profession.</Sentence> <Sentence>He glorified soap and water, and impressed on us that
toothbrushes were better than face-powder.</Sentence> <Sentence>Only in one instance do I
recall his words.</Sentence> <Sentence>At parting, he said, ‚ÄúDemand decent salaries, and
wear clean linen.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>At the Normal and in our section, there was a Miss Dale, who boarded
on <Location>Jemima Street</Location> (now <Location>Elgin Avenue</Location>) and who began to have her lunch
with Ellen and me when the weather grew colder.</Sentence> <Sentence>We often walked home
together.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a horse-car on Notre Dame and one on William, but
walking was cheaper.</Sentence> <Sentence>I decided to go to board with her in December.</Sentence> <Sentence>My
room at the <Location>Kate Street</Location> house was too cold to study in now that the
real winter had come.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I began to go with Miss Dale to the First Baptist Church, where
the Rev.</Sentence> <Sentence>Alex Grant was the preacher, and where the great friendliness
of the people amounted to a rollicking joviality which I enjoyed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One night Mr. Grant spoke from the text, ‚ÄúBe sure your sin will find
you out,‚Äù a wonderful sermon, dramatic and rather awful.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was the
athletic type of preacher who wiped his glistening face, threw his
arms about, took off his coat, kicked a chair out of his way, made
faces, gesticulated, but never forgot what he was putting over to his
people.</Sentence>

<Sentence>His wild ways fascinated me though I did not like that sort of
preaching, and wondered why my quiet and dignified Miss Dale should be
so keen on it, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a mighty man of God,‚Äù she often said in her
meekly positive way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly as I listened to him that night, I had all the sensation of a
lost soul.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not see it coming.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had no bitter sins to account
for, though I did run off with the boots and I forgot the monkey
wrench in the bottom of the buggy, and I lied to save Nap, but I
always felt that debt had been paid in full.</Sentence> <Sentence>But that night in the
Baptist church I became conscious of sin, not isolated sins.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
Sin, black, heavy and cold that clutched my heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had all the
loneliness and isolation of the damned; and when Mr. Grant asked all
who felt the need of prayer to stand up, I stood.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think there were
others, but I am not sure.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I needed anything I could get.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was an after meeting and some noisy conversions.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had every sensation
of spiritual sea-sickness.</Sentence> <Sentence>My heart was as heavy as lead.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We walked home without a word, but I knew Miss Dale understood how I
felt.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we went upstairs she began to talk to me in her sweetly
persuasive way.</Sentence> <Sentence>She said we were all sinners until we came under the
sacrifice of Christ, and then we became free and that there was no
other way to find peace.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúLord I believe, help thou my unbelief,‚Äù she
said had been the text that floated her to shore, when she found
herself just where I was, lost and alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am always grateful that I
found so wise and gentle in interpreter.</Sentence> <Sentence>She did not make any
emotional appeal to me, but simply explained to me the plan of
salvation.</Sentence> <Sentence>Perhaps it was my knowledge of her unselfish life, her
kindly spirit, that made me want to be like her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told her so and we
shook hands solemnly.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then she told me we had better pray about it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night I slept a new sleep of great refreshing; psychologists may
say it had a touch of hypnotism.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I know I awakened in a new world,
and to a new vision of being in harmony with God.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first change I noticed was that I was no longer afraid of the dark
or of the lightning or sudden death.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was emancipated from all fear,
and with that came a buoyancy of spirit.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Grant‚Äôs shouting and
gesticulations still bothered me, and I told this to Miss Dale.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe is
a revivalist,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand a great man in his own way.</Sentence> <Sentence>He has a
vision of a lost world.</Sentence> <Sentence>He sees the stream of humanity drifting to the
cataract and rushes out to warn them.</Sentence> <Sentence>So he shouts and swings his
arms.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>If you knew your neighbor‚Äôs house was burning, you would
rush over and scream the news; your voice might be very unpleasant but
you would not think of that.</Sentence> <Sentence>But this is only one aspect of religion.</Sentence>
<Sentence>It‚Äôs the beginning.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life is progress and growth.</Sentence> <Sentence>People must choose
their own.</Sentence> <Sentence>Religion is largely a matter of temperament.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Baptists
think that Baptism is important as an act of obedience, you might not
interpret it as such.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is the spirit that counts, not the form.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went back to Grace Methodist Church but I have always been grateful
to the Reverend Alexander Grant and to dear Annie Dale.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The term closed the end of February but I went home for Christmas
thrilled at the prospect.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack met me at <Location>Glenboro</Location>, and we talked all
the way home.</Sentence> <Sentence>I seemed to have been away for years.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a glorious night of stars, but no moon, and in the dim light
the horses trotted along the road they knew so well, their bells
chiming cheerfully.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMother made be put the bells on,‚Äù Jack said, ‚ÄúShe
said there could not be a real Christmas without sleigh-bells, but I
think that‚Äôs a sort of down-east notion.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI like them, Jack,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbells are like voices, and you can
imagine how glad she has often been to hear these bells, through the
dark and through the storms, telling her her men were coming
home.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>It‚Äôs the law anyway for teams to have bells or lanterns.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes,‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúbut half the teams on the road have no bells.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Billy Hawkins was stopped by a policeman in Brandon and told he had to
have sleigh bells attached to some part of the harness, and so he got
one bell and put it on the end of his lines; so he is obeying the law,
all right.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat‚Äôs the difference,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbetween the letter and the spirit.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
wonder why people think it is smart to evade the laws, that have good
sense back of them and are made for the protection of the public.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I have had many occasions since for the same wonder.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lizzie had made me a new dress, the prettiest one I had ever had, fawn
ladies cloth, and Jack had bought me a new pair of kid shoes with
clear glass buttons.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had a party one night while I was home, and Bob and Jack Naismith
came and a visitor, Turie Kinley, from <Location>North Dakota</Location>, Bert Ingram and
some others.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI guess you‚Äôve pretty nearly forgotten us, Nellie,‚Äù Bob said when we
shook hands.</Sentence> <Sentence>The gulf of years divided us now.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was all of four
months since I had seen him.</Sentence> <Sentence>Bob was still my first choice among all
the boys I knew.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would have been glad to have him in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> to
show the girls for he was a handsome boy with his fine blue eyes and
straight shoulders.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had a new suit too, and a blue tie with a
horse‚Äôs head set with ruby eyes for a tie-pin, and from the upper
pocket of his coat protruded the hemstitched corners of a white silk
handkerchief.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Doherty organ with a lamp on one side and a blue vase filled with
dried grasses and rose haws on the other, standing diagonally across
one corner of the room; the new carpet with the spotted lilies and all
the best sofa cushions on the home-made lounge, and the long white
lace curtains at the windows freshly done; the bright fire burning
behind the mica windows in the round stove; and the smell of coffee
coming in from the kitchen, showing that this was a real party, all
combined to make me well satisfied and quite proud of my home folks.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Most of all I was proud of the flow of conversation.</Sentence> <Sentence>At our house we
always had good talk.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah and Jack had been at a wedding the week before and Hannah had
played the Wedding March; and then been asked by the bride to sing,
‚ÄúWhen Gathering Roses Look Out For the Thorns,‚Äù which some of the
company who knew the bridegroom thought was a most appropriate
selection.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We played charades and the guessing game, and it must have been
half-past eleven when the party broke up.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember the songs we
sang, ‚ÄúClementine,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Dying Nun,‚Äù ‚ÄúNellie Gray‚Äù and ‚ÄúLily Dale‚Äù and
other touching melodies.</Sentence> <Sentence>The mortality rate among the song heroines of
that day was high indeed.</Sentence> <Sentence>They snuffed out very easily .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>one
breath of cold air and then crape on the door and a new mound on the
hillside!</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe sat at the door
  One cold afternoon
  To watch the wind blow
  And see the new Moon.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That was enough.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was gone before the spring flowers carpeted the
fields or the robins had nested again.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Dying Nun, too, was a sad
story but we loved it:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúLet the air blow in upon me,
  Let me see the midnight sky,
  Stand back sisters from around me,
  God!</Sentence> <Sentence>it is so hard to die.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then there was another about a young woman of great beauty and promise
cut off in her prime, who answered to the name of Maybelle:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúMaybelle, Maybelle, my beautiful pale proud wife,
  You are sleeping alone ‚Äôneath the cold gray stone
  While I lead a darkened life.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>And the recitations at that time were a bit on the sombre side, too.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The Dismal Swamp told the story of a young man who had become crazed
by the loss of his young love and believed that she had gone to the
Dismal Swamp and that he was on his way to join her:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúHer firefly lamp I soon shall see,
  Her paddle I soon shall hear;
  Long and loving our life will be,
  And I‚Äôll hide the maid in a cypress tree
  When the footstep of death is near.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then, of course, we had ‚ÄúThe Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night‚Äù and the
‚ÄúLast Hymn‚Äù with its tale of heroism on the high seas; and a fiercely
dramatized one I had been taught by Mrs. Schultz, called ‚ÄúThe Burning
Prairie.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù American influence was shown in ‚ÄúBarbara Fritchie,‚Äù which
was one of Hannah‚Äôs offerings.</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúShoot if you must, this old gray head,
  But spare your country‚Äôs flag,‚Äù she said.</Sentence>

(<Sentence>As I write this a forgotten radio at the other end of the room is
crooning away under its breath something about smothered kisses and
ladies gone in the dawn.</Sentence> <Sentence>I turn it up to give it a chance to compete
with the sad old songs of long ago; and the words I get are these:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúI would give anything under the sun to get you under the moon.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I shut it off hastily and return to the melodies of other days.</Sentence>)




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXI‚ÄîMy First School</Sentence>


<Sentence>The normal closed at the end of January, and I had now a Professional
Certificate which would give a license to teach during the pleasure of
the Board; but I did not avail myself of this privilege until August
of that year.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Annie Dale had gone to teach near Manitou when the Normal was over,
and at the end of the first term was offered the home school at High
Bluff.</Sentence> <Sentence>To fill her contract, she would need to find another teacher
for her school at Manitou, and so wrote to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I put in my application
and was accepted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had stayed at home after the Normal closed, partly to help around
the house.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother was determined that I should do this for she thought
I was too young to teach.</Sentence> <Sentence>The time had gone quickly; Jack and I had
been asked to the parties in the neighborhood, and I had gone to one
public dance in the new town of <Location>Wawanesa</Location>, on the bank of the Souris,
five miles west of our farm, where the railroad crossed the river.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother had been quite willing that I should go to the ball for Jack
wanted me to go.</Sentence> <Sentence>That was sufficient reason for her; and I have no
doubt she was glad to see that Jack and I had stopped quarrelling.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother had the Old-world reverence for men, and attributed to her sons
qualities of wisdom and foresight which, no doubt, surprised them.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
had no faith in my discretion at all, and if I were out after sundown,
she had visions of disaster, especially train disaster.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was warned
of the train every time I went to <Location>Wawanesa</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But if Jack were with me,
I could even go to a public dance-hall, which I know she regarded as a
wicked place, not so much because of the dancing, but because, in a
room adjoining there were games, ‚Äúwith the devil‚Äôs books.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou should be proud to go out with your brother,‚Äù she often said,
‚Äúand it is very good of him to want to take you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I resented this, and
after Jack grew up, he did too; but we knew she couldn‚Äôt help it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
was part of her day, and was partly caused by the fact that she had
never known the companionship of a brother; and had never ceased to
mourn for her two little brothers, who had died in infancy, and whom
she could not even remember.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On August 16th I left from the new station at <Location>Wawanesa</Location> to ride the
seventy-five miles to <Location>Somerset</Location>, where I would be met by one of the
trustees of Hazel School, and driven the seventeen miles to his home,
where I was to board.</Sentence> <Sentence>My new tin trunk was in the baggage car, and I
had a check for it pinned into my alligator purse.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not more
than half full‚Äîthe trunk, I mean‚Äîalthough it contained all my earthly
possessions, and it was securely roped as well as locked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah and Mother and Jack came to the station with me and shook hands
solemnly when we said good-bye; Mother did not believe that kissing
belonged to a public farewell.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNow Nellie‚Äù, she said, when we heard the high windy whistle of the
train on the other side of the river, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting to be a big
girl, and you are out in the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the Normal you had teachers,
but now you are a teacher yourself, and you must keep that in mind.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Don‚Äôt talk, but listen, and don‚Äôt believe all you hear, and don‚Äôt be
afraid to admit you do not know.</Sentence> <Sentence>And remember, no matter what happens
to you, you can always come home, and be welcome.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We could see the train coming down the long grade, on the other side
of the river, its shrill whistle echoing through the hills.</Sentence> <Sentence>It tore
through me with a new and rather terrifying significance.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
leaving home!</Sentence> <Sentence>It was too late to turn back now!</Sentence>

<Sentence>But when I was in the train, which wound its way through the wooded
valley up to the plain again, and looked across the long sweep of
prairie flowing into the sandhills of the Assiniboine to the east and
north, and picked out our home, and all the neighbors‚Äô houses, seen
for the first time in this perspective, some of the exaltation of the
occasion came to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had longed for freedom, and now I had it!</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a blue misted morning, heavy with the fragrance of ripening
grain, and harvest flowers that the dew had mellowed, golden rod, wild
sage and gaillardia.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stood out on the back platform holding to the
rail, for the road bed was still rough, and the train seemed to fly.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Its long plume of smoke was thrown from side to side as the track
twisted, obscuring at last the whole neighborhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>At the other side
of the train lay the rough country we called the <Location>Tiger Hills</Location>, with
sloughs and hay meadows and a few scattered farm houses.</Sentence> <Sentence>Soon it was
all new to me; and I was off and away in a strange world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In many of the little places there was not even a station, just a
store and perhaps a lumber yard.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told the conductor I had not been
over the road before, and he would have to see that I was put off at
<Location>Somerset</Location>, for I wouldn‚Äôt know it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He assured me he would see to this.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one would know <Location>Somerset</Location>,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a stop; no more.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There may be a horse and a haystack and maybe not.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I‚Äôll see that
you get off.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre sure someone will meet you?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I thought of what Mother had said, that I always could come home, and
I wished she had not said it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It worried me, for it suggested a
possibility I might fail, and have to come home because I couldn‚Äôt
manage the school.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I thought of poor Louie Smith, whom no one had
seen for months, and no one could ask for.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had been working in
Brandon, and got into trouble and come home, and there was great
sympathy for her family.</Sentence>

<Sentence>For a few moments I had a panicky feeling of dread, the world seemed
full of unseen dangers; what did I know of this place I was going to?</Sentence>
<Sentence>Of course Annie Dale would be safe any place, safe as an angel; all
the hosts of heaven were around her.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went out on the back platform again and sought comfort from the open
air, and the harvest sunshine that lay on the fields.</Sentence> <Sentence>Horses in a
pasture galloped away from the train, snorting and full of terror.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They needn‚Äôt be so terrified.</Sentence> <Sentence>The train stayed on its track and
pursued no one.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life was like that too, I argued.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I remembered that I had three oranges given to me when I said
good-bye to Mr. Storey who kept the store in <Location>Wawanesa</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one who had
three oranges could be entirely fearful or cast down.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was put off at <Location>Somerset</Location>, in the bush, and was surprised to see so
many trees.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no horse in sight, but the haystack was there,
and a new unpainted platform, bare except for my trunk, which seemed
to have shrunk since I had seen it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stood beside it and watched the
train as it pulled away in the distance; the conductor standing on the
platform waved back to me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a house about a mile away which I could see through an
opening in the trees; and it gave me reassurance.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was sure I would
be met by some one.</Sentence> <Sentence>The rounded and slated top of my trunk wasn‚Äôt a
comfortable seat, so I got off and sat on the edge of the platform;
and time went on; a few mosquitoes came out of the bush and circled
around me, and I wondered if there were timber wolves in this wild
region.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could still see the train for the track runs straight east
from <Location>Somerset</Location> for several miles.</Sentence> <Sentence>Its whistle came back lonesomely and
soon it dipped out of sight, though I could still hear its rhythmic
beat on the rails.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Having lived with people all my life, being one of a family of six,
this was my first time to be alone in a strange place; and a new
feeling not entirely unpleasant, came with it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Time seemed to have
suddenly stopped here in this quiet spot, with its two parallel lines
of steel leading in and leading out.</Sentence> <Sentence>This empty space, this silence
marked the end of an era.</Sentence> <Sentence>The curtain had fallen on the first act, and
even if the audience grew restless, there was nothing it could do but
wait.</Sentence> <Sentence>The play would go on.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the first time in my life that I
became conscious of the film of time that comes in, and goes out; the
future at one end, and the past at the other, with only that
split-second, ours to use, that changing line as thin as paper, which
we call the present.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>The drop curtain ahead of me with its lines
of steel leading straight into the unknown .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and at last the
turn of the road.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life had picked me up and was carrying me along.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
was on my way .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>into a new world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had no way of telling the time, and though it seemed that I sat
there for days, it may not have been more than an hour.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I heard
the sound of wheels coming in from the south, and a horse and
buckboard came in view.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stood up and waited.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDid anyone get off the train here this morning?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù the driver shouted
to me before he had reached the platform, rather needlessly I thought.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes,‚Äù I shouted back, ‚ÄúI did.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI expected to meet the teacher for our school, she was coming from
<Location>Wawanesa</Location>, but by golly I‚Äôll bet she missed it, and I‚Äôve had my trip
for nothing, and in harvest time and all.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I looked at him closely.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered if he were doing what the English
call chaffing.</Sentence> <Sentence>But his solemn German face expressed only deep concern.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He was a big man with a hardy sunburnt face, and closely clipped
moustache.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was full of recriminations.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBy golly, it‚Äôs no fun being a trustee,
I‚Äôll tell you, and dealing with teachers.</Sentence> <Sentence>They never know their own
mind five minutes.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had a dandy teacher, a real lady; but I knew she
was too good to last.</Sentence> <Sentence>She just stayed the six months and then got the
school at her home.</Sentence> <Sentence>And now we‚Äôre sure in a fix, and all the children
will be there Monday.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôm going to get out of the hull thing, this is
my last year, and they‚Äôll never get me in a box like this again.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúToo bad,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut maybe you can give me a ride.</Sentence> <Sentence>You came in from
the south, didn‚Äôt you?</Sentence> <Sentence>Well, I‚Äôve had a disappointment too, I expected
one of the trustees of my school to meet me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Probably he did not read
my letter right, or forgot to come.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suppose he‚Äôll get here some
time, but I can‚Äôt sit here another day.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He got out of the buggy, and stepped up on the platform.</Sentence> <Sentence>We looked at
each other critically.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I put out my hand, ‚ÄúHow are you, Mr.
Hornsberg,‚Äù I said, as pleasantly as I could, ‚Äúfine day isn‚Äôt it?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù He
broke into a laugh.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBy golly,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI was wondering how I was
going to square myself for being late.</Sentence> <Sentence>I saw the smoke of the train
soon after I left St. Leon, and I‚Äôve been makin‚Äô up my speech all the
way.</Sentence> <Sentence>But you don‚Äôt mean to tell me you can teach.</Sentence> <Sentence>You don‚Äôt look any
more than fifteen.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He put my trunk in the back of the buckboard and we set out; reaching
a good prairie trail at last.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our road lay through the French village
of <Location>St</Location>. Leon, where a Catholic church school and convent stood on the
shore of a small lake.</Sentence> <Sentence>The white-washed houses with bright blue doors
and windows, swarmed with children, and dogs ran after us barking.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
houses stood close together on the one little street, each with a
square fenced garden with sunflowers and corn, and the cabbage in neat
rows.</Sentence> <Sentence>A few poppies brightened the potato patches.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Flushes of garden scents, mignonette and healing herbs came to us on
the breeze; the leaves of the trees made a gentle whispering, and
stood like guardian angels with their branches outspread above the
little houses.</Sentence> <Sentence>I sensed a peace of mind and tranquility; a vague
heart-healing that comes in churchyards and holy places, and I would
have been glad to sit beside the road and let this dappled sunlight
fall on me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would go back some day I thought, and refresh my soul in
this sheltered, peaceful concordant place; with its untroubled faith,
its ordered resignations.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the children standing inside the fences
looked at us with quiet eyes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The wells interested me, one at each end of the street, each with a
high windlass and a heavy stone in a canvas bag on the end of the rope
to help pull up the bucket.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Years afterwards, I saw many such villages in <Location>France</Location>, with the same
contrivance built over the well; the same white-washed houses, blue
trimmings and the same evidences of thrift.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúFine people, these French,‚Äù said Mr. Hornsberg, as we drove slowly
through the little street and around the end of the lake, ‚Äúand a grand
religion they have.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think I‚Äôll turn Catholic this fall when the
work‚Äôs done.</Sentence> <Sentence>Their God seems to do more for them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course they got
to pay; up early, beads, prayers, early mass and confession, but they
get results.</Sentence> <Sentence>See their fields and gardens, now take a look at them,
for they are the last crops you‚Äôll see.</Sentence> <Sentence>All our stuff is flattened to
the ground, hailed out‚ÄîI forgot to tell you, we won‚Äôt be able to pay
you, we‚Äôre broke.</Sentence> <Sentence>But as I was saying it beats all how the Catholics
are favored, and I think I‚Äôll put in with them.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>The hail has
made a clean sweep across our district, and the gardens are flattened
and black.</Sentence> <Sentence>There will be cattle feed from the crops, and that is all.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But we‚Äôll keep you, even if you are not what we expected, and you‚Äôll
get your board anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>So you‚Äôd better eat hearty, for the more you
eat the more you‚Äôre getting.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think my driver got quite a thrill of pleasure when coming over a
rise a new district lay before us with a magnificent sweep of country
falling away to the south, and I asked in sincere admiration, ‚ÄúWho
owns the fine house?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat‚Äôs mine,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI mean its ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>My wife works harder than I
do.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then he laughed to himself and said, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt kick too hard about
the hail, we‚Äôve had good years here, and we should take one backset
without howling.</Sentence> <Sentence>One failure every five years isn‚Äôt going to kill
anyone.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we went in by the back door to the fine, big, clean kitchen where
Mrs. Hornsberg welcomed me, I could see that he had good reason for
his cheerfulness; and I knew I had come to a pleasant place.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
windows were full, and not too full, of blooming geraniums, red and
white;‚Äîthe stove shone black as ebony on a yellow painted floor, a
rocking chair with a bright chintz cushion stood beside a table on
which lay a book and a knitting basket.</Sentence> <Sentence>The smell of Saturday‚Äôs
baking, spicy rich and moist, told me there were apple pies, and fruit
cake somewhere near.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Beyond the kitchen lay the dining room, the living-room of the house,
and here were more flowers, petunias, predominating, and a hanging
fuchsia in a basket in one window, and the white star of <Location>Bethlehem</Location> in
another.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were strips of rag carpet on the yellow floor, and a
fine big shining stove in the middle of the room.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not in use as
a stove in the summer, but served as a stand for a stone crock filled
with yellow sunflowers.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not notice these details in my first
glance, but I did know that I had come into a pleasant hospitable
house, where order and cleanliness prevailed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Esther, who was a few months younger than I, took me to my room off
the dining-room, and when I was hanging up my coat and hat on the
hooks behind the door, she told me hurriedly: ‚ÄúThis is my room, but
the teacher has always had it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Do you mind having me sleep with you?</Sentence> <Sentence>I
am very quiet and won‚Äôt kick .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>I can sleep up-stairs, but I‚Äôd
rather stay here .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>we‚Äôve never had as young a teacher as you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew afterwards that was a long speech for Esther to make, for she
did not exaggerate when she said she was quiet.</Sentence> <Sentence>Esther stayed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was a pleasant room we shared with a big wide oak bed, with a
mattress and feather tick, and two huge goose down pillows.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the
daytime the bed had a blue and white patchwork quilt which Esther
always took off at night and folding it neatly, put it way with the
pillowshams which matched.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suspected that this elaborate set had
been put on for my arrival, so I suggested one day that they be put
away for very special occasions.</Sentence> <Sentence>Esther gladly did this, and told me
her mother had made them when she was married, and had given them to
her, ‚ÄúThough,‚Äù she said sadly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never need them for I‚Äôll always
be at home.</Sentence> <Sentence>No man will ever look at me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am too quiet.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I tried to
comfort her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told her men liked quiet women; it was a distinct
advantage to be quiet, and she was good-looking, and that was what
counted with men, I knew.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had three brothers, and I had heard them
talk.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was interested but not convinced.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMother was married when she was
fifteen,‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt it awful?</Sentence> <Sentence>There‚Äôs only sixteen years
between us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dad is ten years older.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Beyond the dining-room, across the square hall, was the parlor, a
square papered room with lace curtains on its two long windows and a
real carpet that covered the entire floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Here, between the windows
and angling across the corner stood the organ, another Doherty with
its music racks well filled with Czerny exercises and sheet music, for
Esther went every week into town for a lesson from Miss Clarke.</Sentence> <Sentence>Esther
took her music lessons as seriously as she did everything in life, and
every morning when the alarm clock began it clatter she reached out
for it, deadening its din into a throaty gurgle.</Sentence> <Sentence>Dressing herself
without a sound, she went out, and began her hour‚Äôs practice.</Sentence> <Sentence>And how
luxuriously rich I felt in being able to turn over for another good
hour‚Äôs sleep, all the sweeter because of the five finger exercise,
runs and chords that mingled with my dreams.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There were book cases in the parlor filled with E. P. Rowe‚Äôs and
Pansy‚Äôs books, and an Elsie Dinsmore or two, the Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress,
Fenimore Cooper‚Äôs Leather Stocking Tales, and Alexander Dumas‚Äô sombre
romances, and years‚Äô numbers of the _Youth‚Äôs Companion_ and the
_Farmers‚Äô Advocate_.</Sentence> <Sentence>I always enjoyed reading aloud, and many a
pleasant evening we spent in the big room with a warm fire in the
round stove, after the two little boys, Tommy and Fred, had gone to
bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember especially how we enjoyed ‚ÄúHe fell in love with his
wife,‚Äù by E. P. Rowe, in the reading of which Charley, fifteen years
old, took turns with me, while Esther crocheted, and Mrs. Hornsberg
knit, and Mr. Hornsberg stretched out on the long brown sofa and
slept.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our evenings always ended in the same way; with terrible regularity
the head of the house wakened with a loud shout soon after ten.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMy
landsakes alive Jenny,‚Äù he would roar at us, ‚Äúwhat do you mean, do you
never look at the clock?</Sentence> <Sentence>Here it is getting on to twelve o‚Äôclock, and
you let these crazy kids sit and read, and the teacher has no more
sense than the others.</Sentence> <Sentence>We‚Äôll never get them up tomorrow, its all we
can do to get them started when they go to bed in good time.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I
can‚Äôt even fall asleep without something going wrong.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first night this happened, I was frightened at his violence, but
that soon passed.</Sentence> <Sentence>He loved to rage and roar and shout.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he kept it
up too long, Mrs. Hornsberg quieted him with a word, ‚ÄúAll right,
William, we hear you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Not once did I hear him answer back.</Sentence> <Sentence>Like
Esther‚Äôs touch on the alarm clock a word from his wife stopped the
uproar.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I learned something of German thrift and foresight in the Hornsberg
family.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was enough home-canned vegetables in the dark cellar to
last two years, and so the hail which had destroyed the garden made no
difference to our meals.</Sentence> <Sentence>We went on eating green peas, squash and
cauliflower.</Sentence> <Sentence>The straw stacks were not burned on this farm as they
were by the neighbors, but kept until the following year.</Sentence> <Sentence>So there
would be cattle feed, and there was hay stacks two years old.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
out-buildings too, were neatly painted and every bit of machinery was
housed when not in use.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cows were tied in the stable at night,
with a chain that came from a collar around their necks and the end
snapped into a ring above their heads, just long enough and no longer,
so there was no danger of an animal becoming entangled in the tie
chains.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were two good wells, each with a pump, and the farm yard
was kept clean of straw or debris.</Sentence> <Sentence>The wood pile had the precision of
a pile of cans in a store window.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Sunday was the outstanding day of the week, preparations for which
began on Saturday.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Hornsberg was not a member of the church but he
was a zealous adherent, and saw that the whole family was present at
the morning service.</Sentence> <Sentence>To usher them into the family seat, take his
place at the end, glower at the two young boys, who sat next him, to
dry up the least trace of frivolity, dispose of his hat on the wires
below the seat, and then settle down to a quiet hour of close
scrutiny, without once turning his head, was one of the pleasures of
his life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Coming home, we heard a report of the congregation; ‚ÄúMrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sears has a
new hat at last.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wonder how she ever got old Abe to open up; and a
pretty one.</Sentence> <Sentence>Gosh, but she looks a lot better.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Still, I‚Äôm sorry
you didn‚Äôt see the old one.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was high at the back, and sloped down
to the front; had the look of a cow getting up.</Sentence> <Sentence>Do you know a cow gets
up different to a horse?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Yes, I knew.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAaron Smith looked sour as vinegar today.</Sentence> <Sentence>He traded a horse yesterday
with Bill Jeffrey.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll bet he didn‚Äôt hear a word of the sermon, every
place he looked he‚Äôd see a spavin.</Sentence> <Sentence>Did you see the man two seats ahead
of us, the one whose neck is cracked like an alkali bed?</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôll tell you
a funny thing about him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs innocent in his ways, says queer things.</Sentence>
<Sentence>A man from town went out to insure his life and told him that Charley
Brown, who had just died had a three thousand dollar policy, and had
only paid one premium; paid fifty-two dollars and got three thousand,
but Elias Smiley said, ‚ÄòOh, well, I‚Äôd never be lucky like that!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô
.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDid you notice the family that whispered when the sermon was going
on.</Sentence> <Sentence>That makes me mad.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the minister would check them for it, I‚Äôd
give him two bags of oats.</Sentence> <Sentence>How did you like our choir?</Sentence> <Sentence>That big fellow
can sing, can‚Äôt he?</Sentence> <Sentence>It sounds like hollering into a rain barrel but I
always liked to do that.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Peters has a kind of a zither to her
singing, sounds like she has a fine tooth comb between her teeth.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The sermon was not included.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not being a member, he said he didn‚Äôt set
himself up to judge preaching, any minister was good enough for him,
for he kept all his religion in his wife‚Äôs name anyway.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Life took on a new interest that first Sunday afternoon when Esther,
Charley, Fred and I went to Sunday School.</Sentence> <Sentence>Esther and I went to one of
the class rooms behind the choir loft, to the Young Ladies‚Äô Bible
Class.</Sentence> <Sentence>We lived three miles out of Manitou, and so we had to step
lively to get home from church, and have dinner, and get back for the
3 o‚Äôclock Sunday School, but it was the thing to do.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Now, this was a very particular Sunday, the first Sunday for the new
minister‚Äôs wife to teach the class.</Sentence> <Sentence>The new minister had come from
<Location>Port Arthur</Location>, <Location>Ontario</Location>, and the Young Ladies‚Äô Bible Class was waiting
for her.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was a beautiful woman, in her late forties, and dressed
exquisitely in a brown cashmere dress with smocked yoke and cuffs,
with a moonstone brooch to hold her linen collar in place.</Sentence> <Sentence>She wore a
velvet bonnet trimmed with folds of silk that make me think of the
rosy tints of a winter‚Äôs dawn, opalescent in their changing sheen; and
her eyes!</Sentence> <Sentence>when looking into her eyes, I saw the browns and greens and
gold of the moss in the meadow brook at home when the sunshine fell
into its clear stream.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The lesson I remember, was the story of the Prodigal Son, and the
group of 1890 flappers with their hair in braids with the ends teased
out, were not especially interested in the Prodigal Son coming or
going.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I, being a teacher myself, and having sympathy for a
fellow-sufferer, fell upon the lesson with fervor.</Sentence> <Sentence>I drew lessons,
expanded thoughts, asked questions, repeated the golden text and was
able to tell where it was found.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed, I can safely say without
pride, I was the best girl in the class, and though I was probably
detested by the others, I saw gratitude in the teacher‚Äôs golden brown
eyes, and came home in an exalted mood, quite determined to keep to
this breakneck pace of proficiency.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The family at home were greatly interested when we told them that the
minister‚Äôs wife had taught our class.</Sentence> <Sentence>A new minister‚Äôs wife is always
‚Äúnews.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Esther did her best to describe her, but even though she
described the brown dress, velvet bonnet and moonstone brooch, I felt
her description lacked something, authority, or conviction, or
enthusiasm or something.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIn fact,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúshe is the only woman I have ever seen whom I
should like to have for a mother-in-law.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Esther‚Äôs mother checked my enthusiasm by telling me the minister‚Äôs
wife had only two quite young boys.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I enquired their ages.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúFourteen and ten.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I pointed out that I was not quite seventeen, and what was three
years‚Äô difference in ages anyway?</Sentence> <Sentence>It would never be noticed when he
was fifty and I was fifty-three.</Sentence> <Sentence>Having put my hand to the plow, I was
not going to be turned aside by three little insignificant years.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXII‚ÄîWinds of the World</Sentence>


<Sentence>The first days at school filled me with dismay.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nothing came right,
and all I had learned from Baldwin‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchool Management‚Äù, seemed to
have turned to dust and ashes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not keep the forty children
busy.</Sentence> <Sentence>I do not know what I would have done without Esther and Charley,
who turned in generously and became my assistants.</Sentence> <Sentence>They gave out
spellings, and work on the board, took care of disputes over pencils
and books.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In a week I knew all the names, and had my timetable working.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I
felt ashamed of the way my Normal Training had deserted me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stayed
after school each evening and arranged my work as well as I could, and
having done all and hoping for the best walked home to my boarding
place, across the coulee.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a fine flat stone in the bottom of
the coulee, and on it I sat each evening, and meditated in great
humility of spirit.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was failing as a teacher.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Inspector would
discover my weakness, and he might come any day.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hazel School had had
good teachers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Evilena Bell was the first, even yet I heard
echoes of Miss Bell‚Äôs good work.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then a Miss Baker from <Location>Ontario</Location>, and
Annie Dale, all experienced and capable.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I would have to go home
and admit my failure.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>It was hard to be sad on those warm bright September evenings with the
comfortable homely sounds, and sights; cow-bells tingling, crickets
chirping in the long grass, the drone of mowers cutting the green
feed, the rich amber sunshine dulled with haze.</Sentence> <Sentence>These, and the
prospects of the good supper waiting for me, and all the comforts of
the white house, would have lifted my spirits, but for that awful
dread that I might have to go skulking home‚Äîa teacher who could not
hold a job‚ÄîI saw no way of escape unless the school would burn.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
nothing could look more permanent than Hazel School, No.</Sentence> 365, <Sentence>pale
gray in color, with a black roof, standing on a little eminence,
secure, remote from harm with the sinking sun kindling a flame on its
three western windows, a flame that glowed and gleamed, but would
never consume it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew there was no hope of deliverance by fire.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The school attendance had been helped by the hailed crop, and so I had
the peak load of students from the first day.</Sentence> <Sentence>All the big boys and
girls who in a good season would have been at home for the harvest
were coming to school, and it seemed impossible to get time for all
the classes in the whole eight grades.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My difficulties were increased by the fact that nearly all the
families came from the same place in <Location>Ontario</Location>, and carried with them
into the new life, all the sins and sorrows of the past.</Sentence> <Sentence>They knew
each other too well; and some of the old grudges had their roots in
the past generation.</Sentence> <Sentence>This led to fights on the school grounds, rather
serious affairs, that worried me.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the heat of anger, the opposing
factions went deeply into the past and dragged out old skeletons,
flung out old taunts and innuendoes, horrible on the lips of children.</Sentence>
<Sentence>After one of these bouts my senior classes were demoralized, and even
the little ones suffered from the emotional upheaval.</Sentence>

<Sentence>An older teacher might have been able to suppress these outbreaks but
I was afraid to take a high hand with boys and girls almost as old as
myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I was disappointed to note that ‚ÄúFeuds‚Äù were not listed in
‚ÄúBaldwin‚Äôs School Management.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew the root of the trouble was in the homes where these old sins
were freely discussed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Drab lives crave excitement and these
neighborhood fights were the outlet for suppressed emotions.</Sentence> <Sentence>I must
find a healthier form of excitement, or the school was headed for
ruin.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not expect help from the trustees; they came from the
same place in <Location>Ontario</Location>, too, and were not entirely friendly to each
other.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had brought with me a copy of Dr. Egerton Young‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Dogs in the
Northland,‚Äù and I read it for ten minutes following the morning
prayers to insure punctuality.</Sentence> <Sentence>This began the day pleasantly for us.</Sentence>
<Sentence>With my first salary payment I bought a football, and presented it to
the school, telling them that I was going to play with them, and we
would see if we couldn‚Äôt play with good humor.</Sentence> <Sentence>If a fight should break
out, the ball would be locked in my desk for one day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told them
about the English school boys (I had read Tom Brown‚Äôs School Days) and
how the Englishman‚Äôs sense of fair play and good humor had won the
admiration of the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told them about the ‚ÄúOld Spites‚Äù in
<Location>Ireland</Location>, and how the ‚ÄúFairs‚Äù were often the scene of bloodshed though
no one knew exactly what it was all about.</Sentence> <Sentence>I tried to make them laugh
at such foolishness which belonged to the age of superstitions and
ignorance, and had no place now in the lives of sensible young people.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We drew up rules for the football games and everyone had a voice in
the making of these.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone played, and the school room was deserted
at noon by all but little Libby Stiles, whose poor little white face
looked wistfully out from the window.</Sentence> <Sentence>Libby had a weak heart.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So all went well for a couple of weeks, the football took up all the
surplus energy, and I began to hope.</Sentence> <Sentence>One day, one of the girls came to
me almost in tears, and told me her mother had been over at Jeffreys,
and Mrs. Jeffreys and her sister, Mrs. Miller, had said I should not
play football; it wasn‚Äôt a ladies‚Äô game; and they were going to speak
to the trustees about it, and they thought the football should be
taken away for children were just crazy about it, and that‚Äôs all they
were going to school for.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day I wore my longest and best dress, and I went to see Mrs.
Jeffreys.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had met her in Manitou one day, and she had asked me to
come over for supper some night‚Äîone of these flat and wide invitations
that mean nothing‚Äî‚ÄúCome any time,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI always have plenty
cooked.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She seemed to be pleased to see me in a constrained sort of a way.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
wore her wool challey dress and brought out her spiced pears and many
kinds of cake.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jeffreys was the mother of one boy of fourteen, and step-mother
to three others who were away from home.</Sentence> <Sentence>So, having no children to
keep her at home, she went about more than the other women; and she
had her own driving-horse, which added to the evil she could do.</Sentence> <Sentence>She
was a positive woman, with a cut and dried opinion on every subject.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Her knowledge of the neighborhood was profound, and the people were
afraid of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had her own money too, and that gave her an added
importance.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I had to have Mrs. Jeffreys with me, or my scheme
would fail.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would go to the trustees and raise a row.</Sentence> <Sentence>The trustees
were afraid of her too, and the old spites would all be revived in
added bitterness; although I was sure now, that with the football and
plenty of stories, I could handle the situation if I were left alone.</Sentence>

<Sentence>After supper, Mr. Jeffreys and Frank went out, and I helped her to
clear the table and wash up.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were getting along very well I
thought.</Sentence> <Sentence>I let her talk and listened attentively, knowing even then
that a good listener is more sure of popularity than a good talker.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
had no finesse, no adroitness of approach.</Sentence> <Sentence>All I could do was to put
the case before her plainly and bluntly and in getting the case
started, I was somewhat hampered by the fact that she wouldn‚Äôt meet my
eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>She looked over and around me with her darting black eyes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At last I plunged in.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told her why I had bought the football, why I
played with the pupils, my distress over their fights, and their
slanderous charges.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt is horrible,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúto hear young boys and
girls throw hints and sneers across a school ground.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs unnatural
too; they shouldn‚Äôt know these things.</Sentence> <Sentence>They hear too much at home, and
it‚Äôs all so useless and evil.</Sentence> <Sentence>These children cannot help what happened
in Zorra, and should not be reminded of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think the best way to
stamp out all this nastiness is to give them something fresh and clean
and thrilling to think about.</Sentence> <Sentence>A game of football ought to be more
interesting than the story of how one man‚Äôs father opened a registered
letter and lost his job twenty years ago.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWho said that?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù she cried, stopping her dishwashing in mid-air.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
tone was so sharp I nearly dropped the plate I was drying.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWho has
been talking to you?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one,‚Äù I said hastily, ‚ÄúI merely used that as an illustration.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
charges the boys and girls have been flinging at each other are more
serious than that.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt in Zorra,‚Äù she said excitedly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt never happened anyway
.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>that was a lie .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>it was all a mistake.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Her face had
gone white and her eyes were full of fear.</Sentence> <Sentence>I covered her confusion as
tactfully as I could by talking on, and leading away from the subject.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I knew I had inadvertently stirred a bitter memory and I was sorry
about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt she thought I had deliberately evoked the past to
gain my point, and in that case I was no better than the young
fighters I was trying to reform.</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt remember why I had
mentioned a post-office scandal.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no reason; I just happened
to use it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One good thing came out of my unpremeditated blackmailing; there was
no more talk from her of going to the trustees, and our football games
went on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think it was in October, Esther‚Äôs mother brought back the news from
town that the minister had also a big boy eighteen years old, who had
stayed behind in the East to complete his teaching term.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSo you may have your mother-in-law yet,‚Äù she said to me, as I helped
to carry her parcels into the kitchen, ‚Äúbut,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúhe has red
hair.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI like red hair,‚Äù I said.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hadn‚Äôt known it until that moment, but I
knew then I had always liked it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day when school was over, I went to town.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was dressed in my
best dress, the dark green cloth trimmed with military braid and brass
buttons, hair waved by the use of curling papers the night before;
shoes polished (lard and lamp black), my pale complexion toned up a
little by a vigorous application of a hard towel (afterwards I used a
leaf from a cotton rose on my hat).</Sentence> <Sentence>I had no business or errand that
night.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went to see the boy with the red hair who was working in the
drugstore.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had no excuse either, I remember.</Sentence> <Sentence>I made no pretence of
being the Victorian maiden who sits on the shore waiting for a kindly
tide to wash something up at her feet‚Äînot at all!</Sentence> <Sentence>Having seen
something on the skyline rocking on the current, something that looked
like a treasure, I plunged boldly in and swam out for it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The red-headed boy was in the drug store, a tall, slim young fellow,
with clear blue eyes, regular features and clear skin like his mother.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I bought a fountain pen, taking quite a little while to decide, and
being guided entirely by his superior knowledge, which wasn‚Äôt too bad
for a beginning considering that I was an unsophisticated country
girl, seventeen years old, and had never heard of ‚ÄúDorothy Dix.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I
paid three dollars for the pen, my last three, and I would not receive
any part of my salary for a month.</Sentence> <Sentence>No matter, I paid over the money
with a fine air of opulence, and came home well satisfied with the
evening.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when Mrs. Hornsberg asked me about the young man with the
red hair, I had very little to say.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Two days before Christmas, we had our Concert for which we had been
practising since early Fall.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was an organ in the school, and
Esther played it very well.</Sentence> <Sentence>So we had choruses and duets and solos.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Esther and I sang ‚ÄúWhispering Hope,‚Äù and eight of my little girls of
assorted sizes sang ‚ÄúEvery Little Wavelet,‚Äù with white handkerchiefs
on their heads for the white caps on the waves; and wore blue dresses
of cheese cloth dyed with a quart of ink that had frozen in the school
cupboard.</Sentence> <Sentence>When they swayed from side to side to the rhythm, it would
be a dull person indeed, who could not see the blue waves curling and
breaking into the white foam, and the whole wide circulation of the
sea.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were far from the sea, and these children had never seen a wave,
but they did not dull the picture as they sang:</Sentence>

  <Sentence>Once I got into a boat,
  Such a pretty, pretty boat,
  Just as day was dawning,
  And I took a little oar
  And I pushed out from the shore
  So very, very early in the morning.</Sentence>

  <Sentence>And every little wavelet had its nightcap on,
    Night cap, white cap, night cap on,
  Every little wavelet had its night cap on
    So very, very early in the morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our last number was a dialogue, with three actors.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was a lady
traveller intent upon taking the train to Morrow.</Sentence> <Sentence>Charles was my boy,
and we were loaded with parcels from hat-box to a bird-cage, with a
bird in it, yellow and green made of felt, but a good bird for all
that, with large green eyes (beads loaned for the occasion by Mrs.
Jeffreys).</Sentence> <Sentence>John R. McDonald was the station agent, and possessed of a
sharp and cutting tongue.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was disposed to be scornful of my many
questions regarding the train to Morrow, and could not quite make out
whether I referred to time or place.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My son, Charles, absent-mindedly consumed the lunch reserved for the
journey, while this verbal battle went on, and just when the confusion
was at its height, and the station agent and I had almost come to
blows, the whistle of the train tore through the air of the room
(sound effect produced by willow whistles and one cowbell).</Sentence>

<Sentence>My son and I dashed for the door, dropping parcels as we went; my
carpet bag flew open, and linen collars, hair brush, shoes and various
garments fell out, including a wire bustle and a red flannel
chest-protector; but we could not stay to retrieve them, and did not
even look back.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we reached the outside door, we halted and
listened to the applause, which was generous, and came back to take
our bows.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then it was that Elias Smiley stole our show from us by
rising at the back and calling out, ‚ÄúOh, Teacher, did you get all your
things!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>A boiler of coffee had been made at Mrs. McDonald‚Äôs nearby, and when
it was brought over and the thick white cups borrowed from Huston and
Betts store in town, were passed, and two of the boys went down the
aisles with blue enamel pitchers of coffee to which the cream and
sugar had been added; and good thick ham and salmon sandwiches went
around; followed by layer cake, Spanish bun, marble cake and rolled
jelly cake, and plates of home-made candy, the audience settled down
into great good humor, and a truce was called on all old feuds, past
and present, and east and west of the <Location>Great Lakes</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Jeffreys had
arranged for the refreshments, and a vote of thanks was moved to her
before we parted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was half-past twelve before we left the school, but what a night it
had been!</Sentence> <Sentence>I couldn‚Äôt sleep for thinking of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Already I was planning
what we would do next year to make the people laugh.</Sentence> <Sentence>Laughter was the
cement that would heal the breaks in this neighborhood, laughter and
something to talk of other than past sins and sorrows.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day Mr. Hornsberg drove me over to <Location>Somerset</Location> where I caught
the west freight for <Location>Wawanesa</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>The passenger train came only twice a
week, and the freight was my only hope to get home for Christmas, and
Mr. Hornsberg said the conductor did not mind carrying a passenger.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The day was dull and threatening, with a woolly indistinctness that
blotted out the horizon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Leaden clouds hung low, and although it was
not cold, snow was indicated by the darkening skies.</Sentence> <Sentence>The roads were
bare and hard as iron, and the seventeen-mile drive had been a rough
one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was fortunate in not having to wait for the freight.</Sentence> <Sentence>It came
lumbering in soon after we reached <Location>Somerset</Location>, a long freight with the
caboose at the end.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Hornsberg spoke to the conductor, and he was
quite willing to take me along.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a seat in the cupola of the caboose and enjoyed the wide view it
gave me, but the windows soon misted over with spikes of ice as the
weather grew colder.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt looks like dirty weather,‚Äù the conductor called to me, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôll
try to get you home for Christmas.</Sentence> <Sentence>Snow is our biggest danger and may
be fillin‚Äô in the cuts now.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was filling up the round stove with coal; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lots of this
anyway,‚Äù he said, rasping his shovel into the coal-box, ‚Äúand we‚Äôve
plenty of grub, so you might be in a worse place.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I assured him I was very happy to be allowed to ride on his train, and
I thought it was a delightful way to travel home for Christmas.</Sentence>

<Sentence>About three o‚Äôclock we got into the snow-storm that was working down
from the West; but the snow was dry, and the wind which whistled past
us had kept the tracks clear.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could hear the brakeman and conductor
below, gloomily discussing the chances of getting through.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When it began to get dark, and no more could be seen but a gray wall
of whirling snow (even when I thawed a hole in the frost on the
window) I came down to where the men were, and opened the fine box of
sandwiches, cake and candy I had brought, and these served for dessert
at our evening meal.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told them about the concert, and sang
‚ÄúWhispering Hope‚Äù and the school songs for them, and did all three
parts in the ‚ÄúTrain to Morrow.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù But the storm was worrying them, and
they told me after we left Marieapolis that they were afraid we
wouldn‚Äôt get to <Location>Wawanesa</Location> until about noon the next day.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I might as
well try to sleep.</Sentence> <Sentence>They made up a bed for me, and the conductor
brought a clean towel to cover the pillow.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I climbed up and turned
in, pretty tired after all the excitement of the last few days, and
blissfully happy to be on my way home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The road bed was rough and the freight ran heavily, creaking and
groaning, but I slept although a bitter wind was whistling past us,
and one of the worst storms of the season was raging.</Sentence> <Sentence>Snow sifted in
through the windows and sizzled on the stove below, and I heard
through my dreams the anxious words of the train men, but nothing
could disturb or dim the radiance that flooded my heart.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was going
home, I was re-engaged.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had eighty dollars of my own earnings, and
presents for everybody.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At four o‚Äôclock in the morning we were stuck in the snow and I was
thrown up against the head of the berth by the unsuccessful efforts of
the engineer to buck the drifts.</Sentence> <Sentence>The same jolt upset the stove and the
red hot coals were scattered on the floor.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the brakeman came
running in and righted the stove, and shovelled up the coals before
any harm was done, beyond a great smother of coal smoke.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I
noticed that someone had spread a fur coat over me, and I was glad of
it in the deepening cold of that wild Christmas morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were stuck in the snow until about noon, when the snow plow came
from Brandon and released us.</Sentence> <Sentence>I offered to cook breakfast for the men
but they would not hear of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>The brakeman, whose name was Joe, said
he was ‚Äúterrible particular about his bacon, and couldn‚Äôt trust any
one to get it just right.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù But they did let me wash up the dishes for
they were all working outside, and when the train started to run, they
came back to the caboose and we all wished each other a Merry
Christmas.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was beginning to get dark when we pulled into <Location>Wawanesa</Location>, but Jack
was there to meet me and we were soon home where the whole family had
assembled for the day.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big dinner was over, but the long table was
still set, and I was ready for a good fill of cold turkey, mashed
potatoes, turnips and apple-jelly tarts.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was glad to see all the
relatives looking so handsome in their best clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was especially
thrilled with Addie, Fred and Nellie, Will‚Äôs children, who seemed so
much bigger than when I left.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lizzie and Tom were there too, and they were all anxious to hear about
the delayed train.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother raised a storm of protest when she found I
had ridden on a freight, and slept in a caboose, but I stoutly
defended my kind companions, and the hospitality they had extended to
me.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúSome girls could do it,‚Äù mother said, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs not you,
Nellie.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôre not very good at keeping your distance.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt you
talked to these men.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I confessed that I had.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not only talked with them but sang, and read
aloud from a book called ‚ÄúLucille‚Äù, which one of the boys was taking
to his girl in Brandon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother shook her head.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI wish you had more reserve, Nellie, you make
too free with people,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll go too far with it
some day.</Sentence> <Sentence>These men were strangers to you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom, my brother-in-law, defended me, ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt expect her to sit
there like a bump on a log, Mrs. Mooney,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúRemember she was
the guest of the train crew, and she did the right thing; you needn‚Äôt
worry about the trainmen, they are good company for anyone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know the
conductor, and I‚Äôll bet he enjoyed having her along.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù Will, too, added
a word of approval, for which I was grateful, and my Father said he
couldn‚Äôt see that there was any harm in singing at any time; or in a
bit of pleasant talk.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Our crops had been very good that fall, and that good fortune was
reflected in the Christmas presents.</Sentence> <Sentence>The short winter days passed in a
flash it seemed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I did get my cherished trip to Brandon, and spent
most of my eighty dollars.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I got a black cloth with a knotted stripe for an ulster, and black
persian lamb storm collar, cap and gauntlets; and a checked ‚Äústuff‚Äù
dress and brown velvet trim to it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Later I had my photograph taken in
it, and I bought myself a copy of ‚ÄúLucille,‚Äù in white and silver
binding (which I still possess).</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXIII‚ÄîRaw Material</Sentence>


<Sentence>When I returned to my school I took back a set of Dickens which Will
gave me.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had been given as a premium with the _<Location>Toronto</Location> Mail and
Empire_, _Family Herald_ and some other publications.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt
immeasurably rich in the possession of these long, paper-backed books,
tea-colored and closely printed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I began with _Martin Chuzzlewit_, Charley, Esther and I reading in
turn at night.</Sentence> <Sentence>How we hated Pecksniff, and sorrowed over Tom Pinch‚Äôs
disillusionment when he discovered the arch-treachery of the man he
had trusted.</Sentence> <Sentence>That impassioned paragraph which described Tom‚Äôs feeling
as he went out disgraced, beginning: ‚ÄúSomething without a name;
compassion, sorrow, old tenderness, mistaken gratitude, habit, none of
these, and ye all of them‚Äù never fell on more responsive hearts than
ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tom Pinch, with his homely face, his awkward gait, became to me
a sign, a symbol, a token of all the unattractive people of the world
whose virtue and goodness and beauty are not seen by our dull eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
thought of William, the Englishman, so fine, so dependable, and yet so
likely to be underestimated because he was not good to look at.</Sentence> <Sentence>As I
read and thought and marvelled, a light shone around me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew in
that radiance what a writer can be at his best, an interpreter, a
revealer of secrets, a heavenly surgeon, a sculptor who can bring an
angel out of a stone.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And I wanted to write; to do for the people around me what Dickens had
done for his people.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be a voice for the voiceless as he
had been a defender of the weak, a flaming fire that would consume the
dross that encrusts human souls, a spring of sweet water beating up
through all this bitter world to refresh and nourish souls that were
ready to faint.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could not tell even Charley and Esther how I felt; I had no words to
express the deep, poignant longing that swept my soul.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remembered
the lines from Milton about fame being the spur that makes people
scorn delights and live laborious days.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yet it was not fame that I
craved.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was something infinitely greater.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to reveal
humanity; to make people understand each other; to make the
commonplace things divine, and when I sat on the flat stone on my way
home from school, I thought of these things until my head swam and my
eyes ran with tears.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The depth of my ignorance appalled me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was bound, fettered, gagged
in ignorance.</Sentence> <Sentence>What did I know of the world‚Äôs great literature?</Sentence> <Sentence>My
words were but the ordinary work-worn words of everyday happenings,
and I knew nothing of life.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Moments of despair came to me when I
wished I had never read a word of Dickens.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would be happier without
this terrifying vision.</Sentence> <Sentence>Better to go on teaching a while, stultify my
soul with frivolous things, attractive clothes and social life, settle
down and marry, and forget this shining thorny path winding up the
hill.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I knew I couldn‚Äôt do that.</Sentence> <Sentence>I must go on, even if I went
barefooted, for I had seen a bright light and caught a glimpse of a
heavenly country.</Sentence> <Sentence>I found comfort in knowing that Dickens had only a
meagre education too.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life had taught him, and life would teach me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
had money now (forty dollars a month) and I could buy the books that I
needed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would hammer out my education on the hard anvil of life.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
would mine for words as eagerly as any miner ever dug for gold.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
stars in their courses would work for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Years afterwards when I read
Ralph Waldo Trine‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn Tune with the Infinite‚Äù, I knew every word of
it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It had come to me then when I sat on the stone at the bottom of
the coulee; though I had no words to tell of it, or even think it
with.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a copy of ‚ÄúSesame and Lilies‚Äù and in its pages I found much to
comfort me, and I blessed John Ruskin because he gave me something I
could get my teeth into.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not like his general attitude to women,
or his belief that they were made only to help, comfort, and inspire
men, and that all their education must be to that end.</Sentence> <Sentence>But in the
preface to ‚ÄúSesame and Lilies‚Äù he said that girls should learn to know
the life around them; and if they had time, ‚Äúshould go into the
families of the poor and show them how to make the most of what they
had, coaxing them into pretty and tidy ways, and pleading for
well-folded tablecloths.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Esther and I had laughed about that, and wondered how we would be
received if we went around our neighborhood to coax the women into
pretty and tidy ways.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But one day, little Mary Wheeler asked very wistfully, when she
brought her slate to my desk to have her work corrected, ‚ÄúPlease
teacher, can you sew?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I told her I could a little.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWould you make me
a dress?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù she asked.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúMother hasn‚Äôt any time, and she‚Äôs always sick.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I told Mary I would make her a dress, and asked her what kind she
would like.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe have the print,‚Äù she said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWe‚Äôve had it all summer, and I will
bring it to school tomorrow.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew Mrs. Hornsberg would help me, and she had a sewing machine.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
made the dress, a pretty little buff print with two pockets, pearl
buttons, and an embroidered collar, and my fame was established as a
dressmaker.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then one day Jimmy Burns brought me a note and a pair of sharp
scissors.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúDear Miss Mooney,‚Äù the note said, ‚ÄúI wish you would cut
Jimmy‚Äôs hair.</Sentence> <Sentence>He looks like the colts do in spring, but I can‚Äôt get it
done, and I guess you won‚Äôt mind; for you have more time than I have.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>At noon I set Jimmy on my desk, tied my apron around his neck and did
the best I could do to remove the winter crop from his hard, round
head.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jimmy‚Äôs sister, hovering near, asked a little anxiously, ‚ÄúPlease
teacher, do you think you could cut it curly?</Sentence> <Sentence>Pa said he just bet you
would.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>As I cut Jimmy‚Äôs hair I decided I‚Äôd give his head a long delayed
washing, and put a basin of water on the stove to heat.</Sentence> <Sentence>I kept a good
supply of towels and soap, and had a bottle of violet toilet water in
my desk.</Sentence> <Sentence>So when Jimmy was well shampooed, dried, and scented, he
enjoyed a brief bright hour of popularity, for all the children wanted
to smell his head.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a run on hair-cutting after that, and
Charley had to turn in and do some of it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Having made a dress for Mary Wheeler, we went on and made shirts for
the little boys, and night dresses for Mrs. Wheeler.</Sentence> <Sentence>The annual baby
was about to arrive.</Sentence> <Sentence>Poor Mrs. Wheeler, thin, hollow-eyed, with blue
veins in her thin hands, and misery in her eyes, had too much trouble.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The Wheelers lived on a rented farm, and John Wheeler was the
neighborhood drunkard; that is, the most spectacular one; the one who
drank out of season.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even in harvest time, with the grain shelling in
the field, Johnny Wheeler could not refrain.</Sentence> <Sentence>I found that the people
of this neighborhood drew a sharp line between summer and winter
drinkers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had been over many times, and Mrs. Wheeler talked freely to me.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI
know I shouldn‚Äôt have married John,‚Äù she said one Saturday when I had
gone over to help her white-wash the house.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had pushed everything
into the middle of the floor, and she sat in a rocker on the edge of
the amassment, attending to the last year‚Äôs baby.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stood on a chair
that had lost its back and put the white-wash on the wall with a wide
brush.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThere was a fine man wanted me, and life would have been
different with him for he was steady and thrifty, but he was the most
homely man I had ever seen, and I wanted something to look at!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had heard that before.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had said that when Hannah put ‚Äúmoral
worthiness‚Äù at the head of her list of qualifications for a husband.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
remember the argument we had over it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had stuck out for a fine face
and carriage as qualification number one.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Wheeler rambled on,
‚ÄúJohnny Wheeler was the sort of man who would take any girl‚Äôs eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>My!</Sentence>
<Sentence>I wish you could have seen him then!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She spoke in a monotone, her voice as colorless as her face, and as
limp as a washed ribbon.</Sentence> <Sentence>It came to me now, punctuated by the loud
slaps of the white-wash brush.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou do not see him to any advantage now.</Sentence> <Sentence>He has grown careless and
discouraged, what with the hail and the frost, so many children, and I
have been sick a lot one way and another.</Sentence> <Sentence>Life is not what we hoped it
would be, and it is hard on a man like Johnny.</Sentence> <Sentence>And he‚Äôs a lot better
than plenty of the men around here for he very seldom swears before
the children, and you might say he never comes home drunk.</Sentence> <Sentence>He stays
away and sleeps it off some place and then comes home with a shave and
a hair-cut and a pleasant word for everybody.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs one thing about
Johnny‚Äîhe‚Äôs always pleasant.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I did not see Mrs. Wheeler again until after the baby was born, and
then she told me the story of Johnny‚Äôs lapse from virtue at the time
the baby came.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI never thought he‚Äôd be the worse at a time like
this,‚Äù she said, as she sat rocking the baby in the broken rocking
chair, ‚Äúand mind you, I am not blamin‚Äô him altogether.</Sentence> <Sentence>You see he
thought I would be slower than I was, and he only intended to take one
drink.</Sentence> <Sentence>But one led to another, and he said himself he took the first
one just because he was feelin‚Äô so anxious about me, and he felt the
need of a little bracin‚Äô up.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs very sympathetic, is Johnny, and
can‚Äôt bear to see anyone suffer.</Sentence> <Sentence>Well, anyway, he and the doctor had a
bottle and I guess they were both feeling pretty light in the head
when they left town, and as the afternoon went on and there was so
sign of them on the road, Mrs. Drummond who was with me was so
frightened I was sorry for her, and kept sayin‚Äô Johnny would come, I
was sure he would.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut just when I was at the worst of my pains the minister‚Äôs wife came
in, not knowing anything was wrong, just came to see me, and she just
took one look at me and peeled off her cuffs, rolled up her sleeves,
and I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô you she was as good as any doctor, and it was all over
when Johnny and the doctor came.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fancy her knowin‚Äô what to do.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
always thought from what I had heard of her that she was more of a
lady!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äú</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWasn‚Äôt it fine of her!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúand what a fortunate thing for
you that she happened to come at that time.</Sentence> <Sentence>What did Mr. Wheeler say!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúJohnny felt terrible,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúafter he wakened up.</Sentence> <Sentence>He lay down
and slept as soon as he got in, and didn‚Äôt realize that the baby was
born for hours.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs awful fond of the children, you know, and thinks
this little fellow is the best one yet.</Sentence> <Sentence>I suppose you think I should
be pretty mad at Johnny,‚Äù she went on, reading my face, ‚Äúand maybe I
should.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone says I‚Äôm too easy on him, but I‚Äôll tell you how that
comes.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father was the exact opposite of Johnny.</Sentence> <Sentence>He worked hard,
paid his debts, provided for my mother, and all of us, but never gave
us a civil word; looked like a thundercloud all day long; never joked
or even talked to us; and I was afraid of him and near-about hated
him.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I was always afraid to come home.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I knew I was in for
it.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Now.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs all different.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Johnny is always pleasant.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Careless, easy-going, but pleasant‚Äîand a woman will stand a lot from a
man if he‚Äôs pleasant.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I know there are men who are both good and
pleasant, but they‚Äôre scarce.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe you‚Äôll get one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hope you will,
but get a pleasant one anyway, I say.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I pondered on what I had heard as I walked home across the fields.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Shortly after the Wheeler episode I went to the little town to spend a
Saturday afternoon with a fellow teacher, and before the afternoon
ended we went to a quilting bee at one of the big houses where I
remember the wallpaper was red with green and silver dragons.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was a table in the hall with a rope cover fringed out at the corners
like a yellow horse‚Äôs tail, and on the table was a stuffed owl with
yellow bead eyes.</Sentence> <Sentence>The quilt was being quilted by perhaps a dozen women
and was going to be sent to the Manse for a Christmas present.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Soon after our arrival, one of the women gave out the news that the
Methodist minister‚Äôs wife and another woman were going around with a
petition asking that women be allowed to vote, and a general
discussion arose and surged and swelled above the quilt.</Sentence> <Sentence>I gathered
that the ladies were opposed to the movement, and were bitterly
scornful of the minister‚Äôs wife and her friend for sponsoring it.</Sentence> <Sentence>One
of the ladies, whom I knew afterwards (she was the wife of the town
drunkard), said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an insult to our husbands to even ask for the
vote.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to speak; I wanted my friend the teacher to put them right.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew it must be right if the minister‚Äôs wife believed in it, it must
be right.</Sentence> <Sentence>To my amazement, my friend was scornful, and just as the
conversation became embarrassingly personal, a cry arose that the
ladies were coming, and a knock sounded on the door.</Sentence> <Sentence>At once the
quilters took flight upstairs, even my friend fled with the rest, and
the hostess and I were left.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The ladies explained their errand, while the hostess sat stonily
uninterested on the edge of her chair, and the house pulsed with
strange rustlings.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe thought we would meet with your guests, Mrs. Brown,‚Äù the
minister‚Äôs wife said in her sweet way, ‚Äúbut it seems they have gone,‚Äù
at which the house seemed to fairly creak with suppressed emotions.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I signed the petition, mine being the second name.</Sentence> <Sentence>The hostess
repeated over and over, ‚ÄúI do not think I care to,‚Äù and the ladies
went on their way.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was an embarrassing moment when the quilters came back, shrill with
excitement and stormed at the petitioners, and I had to declare my
allegiance to the Cause.</Sentence> <Sentence>My friend was ashamed of me I know.</Sentence> <Sentence>She felt
she had harbored an anarchist.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to tell them about the minister‚Äôs wife, how she had come into
the Wheeler house and taken charge, and brought the poor woman through
when the doctor and husband had failed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to tell them that
they should have stayed and listened to her for she was a wonderful
woman.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew these were good women, church women, were they not quilting for
the manse?</Sentence> <Sentence>I was surprised to see how bitter they were.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew that women should help each other, and I could see that the
vote would bring an added importance to women, but I could not put it
in words.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had me down.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So I came away and as I walked home the three miles, I pondered with
deep agitation on the world-old problem of ‚ÄúWhy are women so mean to
each other?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I was glad I had signed the petition.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would gladly sign
anything the minister‚Äôs wife asked me to sign, and a fine frenzy of
high endeavor came to me whenever I thought of her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be
like her with her quiet dignity and her well-cut clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was
not a woman in that room who could touch her in appearance, and how
they did, attack her and her friends for ‚Äúinterfering Methodists‚Äù.</Sentence>
<Sentence>That was the terrible thing about the whole experience.</Sentence> <Sentence>How could
these Christian women be so mean?</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew vaguely that it was because
there was a crowd of them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyone of them would have stayed and
listened and at least have been polite.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was my first experience
with the mind of a mob.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a temperance chart in the school which some clever salesman
had sold the trustees for forty dollars.</Sentence> <Sentence>It folded up into a
coffin-like box and stood upright in the little cupboard behind my
desk.</Sentence>

<Sentence>As the result of a temperance lesson in Sunday School I began to study
the handbook of lessons which accompanied the chart; and when a rainy
day kept the children in at noon, I brought out the chart and taught
them from it the effect of alcohol on the human system.</Sentence> <Sentence>The colors
were bright and lurid, and I think the pictures of inflamed membrane
and hob-nailed livers fascinated them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway they liked to see the
pictures, and I bought a bottle of alcohol for the experiments, and we
showed them how alcohol eats up water, thereby rendering the blood
unfit for its work of cleansing, we knew why a drunkard has a red
nose, and why he loses his power of articulation.</Sentence> <Sentence>All went well until
one day my new pupil, Robert John Ricker, challenged the whole theory
in a few memorable words‚Äîbut I must go back and introduce Robert John.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was putting work on the board one day about a month before, when
suddenly the busy hum of the schoolroom ceased.</Sentence> <Sentence>I turned quickly to
see what had happened.</Sentence> <Sentence>Everyone was staring at the door.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On the doorstep stood a little boy of eight, with just the rim of a
straw hat on his head; hair as yellow as fresh wheat stubble, dark
beautiful eyes, cheerful freckles over his nose, and a new tin dinner
pail in his hand.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHello kids,‚Äù he called bravely, though I could see he was a little
frightened.</Sentence> <Sentence>I brought him over to my desk, and found out his name and
age, and learned that he had not been to school, and was not sure
whether he was going to stay now.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll come today, anyway,‚Äù he told me quite honestly, ‚ÄúPa said, ‚ÄòGo on
and give the damthing a whirl.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô‚Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I could see that Robert John thought that ‚Äúdamthing‚Äù was one word.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Robert John was the unspoiled child of nature.</Sentence> <Sentence>His parents were of
German descent, had lived in the Middle <Location>West States</Location>, and had sold out
there to come to <Location>Manitoba</Location> and homesteaded years before.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were
three brothers of them, all with families, and the old grandfather,
who was still the head of the clan.</Sentence> <Sentence>Robert John had never been to
town, or to a picnic, or any gathering.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not one of the connection had
ever been to church.</Sentence> <Sentence>Robert John swore as innocently as a bird sang;
it was merely a form of expression.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He stayed that day, and I was careful to see that it was made pleasant
for him.</Sentence> <Sentence>I allowed his profanity to pass unchecked, for I knew that
one breath of criticism would blow him away.</Sentence> <Sentence>I gave him a new
scribbler, and a bright red pencil, let him clean the boards, and
began a story at four o‚Äôclock, promising to finish it the next
morning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He came back the next day, and I knew I had enlisted him.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he came
to say goodnight to me, at four o‚Äôclock, waiting until the children
were gone, and looking down at his feet, he said:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIf you like, Teacher, you can kiss me now.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I looked at his downcast
little face, and I knew there was something back of his words.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said gravely, ‚Äúbut if I were to kiss you every night,
I‚Äôd have to do it to all the others, and that would be quite a chore.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He looked up.</Sentence> <Sentence>A smile of relief lightened his cherubic face.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then a
mighty oath broke from his, ‚ÄúHell, wait till I get home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Pa said I‚Äôd
have to kiss you night and mornin‚Äô.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs what kept me scared, the
old‚Äî‚Äî.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wish I could record here that I was able to bring Robert John into
the pleasant land of unsullied speech, but I can only say that he did
try to lower the content of his profanity, but even that was a hard
struggle.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHell, Teacher!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù he said, when I approached the subject, ‚Äúhow can a
word be bad?</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs just a sound.</Sentence> <Sentence>It breaks no bones.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù One
day when we were again in conference, he asked me, ‚ÄúWhat do you say
when you‚Äôre mad?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first day that Robert John saw the temperance chart and heard the
lesson, he sat in front of me and listened intently.</Sentence> <Sentence>His face when I
was teaching any class was a delight, in its expression of close
concentration.</Sentence> <Sentence>But on this day, as I went on to show the effect of
alcohol on the lining of the stomach, I could see he was growing
rather restless, and I knew an interruption was coming.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the
lesson was over, he stood up to speak.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúTeacher, did you make the pictures?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo,‚Äù I answered, ‚Äúthese pictures were made in a big city by doctors
who have studied these things for years.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWell, then, I‚Äôll tell you what they are‚Äîthey‚Äôre all lies.</Sentence> <Sentence>My father
says a drink of licker is better than a meal; and he has been drinkin‚Äô
since he was ten, and he was never sick in his life.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now, Teacher!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The other children looked at the young heckler in horror.</Sentence>

<Sentence>For a moment I was nonplussed.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThere are some people, Robert,‚Äù I said cautiously, ‚Äúwho seem to be
able to do anything.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew a man who declared he had never had a
bath, and he was healthy, and strong; and I knew a family who never
opened a window in their house, and they did not have any more colds
than other people who did open their windows.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew a little boy who
could run through the snow in his bare feet, and he seemed none the
worse.</Sentence> <Sentence>But one case does not prove anything.</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway, your father is a
young man yet; it is too soon to say that drinking does not hurt him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>This note of rebellion was well discussed in the neighborhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
trustees who had paid the forty dollars under the spell of the good
salesman, were resentful of his attack, and thought I should have
rebuked him more severely.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some who were not trustees, took sides with
Robert John.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Echoes of the conversations came to school, and the neighborhood
seemed about evenly divided.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could see there was only one way to
settling the matter.</Sentence> <Sentence>So, with the consent of the trustees, and Mrs.
Jeffreys, who agreed to solicit refreshments, we had a public meeting
one Sunday afternoon and everybody came.</Sentence> <Sentence>I showed the chart, and with
the pupils help conducted the experiments.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Everything went off well and the audience listened closely.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
crowning glory of the occasion was that Robert John‚Äôs father came and
made a speech when the lessons were over; a strange speech at a
temperance meeting, but effective, too.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Putting his chew of tobacco in one cheek, ‚ÄúI guess I started this,
folks,‚Äù he said, opening the window behind him and spitting at the
woodpile, ‚Äúby tellin‚Äô my kid that licker is better than grub for a
man; and he shot it on the Teacher, and pretty soon everyone had a go
at it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Well, I ain‚Äôt sayin‚Äô I‚Äôm through, because I don‚Äôt know, but I
do say, a fellow is a damsight better without licker, and I think
these pictures are‚Äî‚Äî, good stuff, for kids to see.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went home that night, walking on air.</Sentence> <Sentence>Right had triumphed.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
victory was ours.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought every man in the neighborhood was
delivered, sobered and safe.</Sentence> <Sentence>The demon, Rum, had been excised, and
cast out.</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be no more Saturday night sprees now that the
real scientific facts were known.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But, the next Saturday night, through the quiet starlight, we were
awakened by the thundering of horses galloping over the frozen ground,
urged on by their tipsy riders, their voices just as raucous as
before,‚Äîand a great disappointment was mine.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I lay awake a long time that night.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXIV‚ÄîThe Young Evangelists</Sentence>


<Sentence>One morning at church we heard an announcement that stirred us deeply.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We were going to have a season of revival, and the evangelists were
two young women, Miss Nettie and Miss Maud Judd from <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
were coming fully authorized by the church, and would probably stay a
month, holding meetings for five nights in the week.</Sentence> <Sentence>And the time was
set after seeding when the farmers would be able to attend.</Sentence>

<Sentence>These young women‚Äôs labors in other fields, the minister said, had
been blessed by God; brands had been plucked from the burning, and
many young lives turned into the paths of righteousness before the
enemy had time to sow the tares.</Sentence> <Sentence>And we were asked to pray earnestly
that great good might come to us all.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Charley, Esther and I talked of it on the way home.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had seen a
picture of the Judd sisters in the _Christian Guardian_, and thought
they were beautiful.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Hornsberg was opposed to the whole idea of
women preachers.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said a man would have no chance.</Sentence> <Sentence>If the girls said
‚ÄúCome to the altar and we‚Äôll pray for you,‚Äù it would be only common
politeness to go.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, no, he wanted no pretty girls mixed up in his
religion.</Sentence> <Sentence>He warned us there would be trouble in families, and he
would not go near them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Of course we knew he would.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one could hold him back.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had never
missed a thing in his life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew a little about women preachers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Andrew Gordon had preached
at <Location>Wawanesa</Location> and Treesbank, in her clear ringing voice, reasoning with
us, patiently, as a mother with her erring children.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Roy of <Location>St. George</Location>‚Äôs Church in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> taught a young ladies‚Äô
Bible Class which I attended there, and I had loved to listen to her
kindly messages.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had read _Adam, Bede_, and had been moved to my heart‚Äôs core by the
preaching of Dinah Morris.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had spent a whole afternoon in Mrs.
McGregor‚Äôs Boardinghouse at Swan Lake, just a few weeks before,
waiting for the mail man, Johnny Moorehouse, to pick me up and give me
a ride to Manitou.</Sentence> <Sentence>The rain, which fell in torrents, delayed him, but
what did I care.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had _Adam Bede_, and my house was thatched.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
afternoon wore into evening and still the rain stroked the windows
with its wet fingers, and I read on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I sorrowed with poor Hetty Sorrell, and scorned the young squire who
had brought such trouble to her, and laughed at Mrs. Poyser, but more
than all these, I preached the gospel with Dinah Morris, up and down
the lanes and greens of <Location>England</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every word she uttered fascinated me.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Now we were going to hear two women preachers, young and beautiful
like Dinah Morris.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to be like her!</Sentence>

<Sentence>They did not disappoint me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nettie, the elder sister, had a face like
a cameo, delicate, sweet and martyrlike, and eyes that burned with a
blue flame.</Sentence> <Sentence>She pleaded and she preached.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know she saw us all
drifting toward the precipice, and she tried to snatch us in her
little hands as we passed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Maud, who was just eighteen, was more of this earth, and therefore,
more attractive to the young generation.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her eyes were very dark
brown, mistily purple like a pansy, and her hair, of the same shade,
curled back from her face.</Sentence> <Sentence>She smiled too, when she talked, and her
voice was a rich contralto.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maud‚Äôs feet were firmly set on the common
earth, and her appeal to us was not so much to save ourselves from
destruction, as to come into harmony with God, because that was a good
and pleasant thing to do.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the Judd sisters sang, I thought the angels in heaven surely
gathered around to listen.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nettie‚Äôs soprano voice, sweet and thin as a
flute, ran up into the rafters of the church, and Maud‚Äôs rolling
contralto swept on like an organ.</Sentence> <Sentence>I can hear them as I write:</Sentence>

  <Sentence>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
    Calling for you and for me,
  See on the portals he‚Äôs waiting and watching,
    Watching for you and for me.</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Come home!</Sentence> <Sentence>Come home!</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Ye that are weary come home.</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
    Calling, oh sinners, come home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>They preached and sang, and had altar calls, and after-meetings; and
Maud conducted the congregational singing and set the men singing
alone; then the women; then the right side, then the left side, and
managed to loosen every voice, and give us all a feeling that we had
taken part.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Their greatest appeal was to the young men.</Sentence> <Sentence>The young evangelists were
beautiful, vital, and just a little too well-dressed to escape the
jealousy of the women.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were so trim, neat, immaculate in their
tailored clothes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maud had a reddish brown rough tweed, made with a
little ripple around the basque, and trimmed with a fringed ruching on
the neck and the sleeves, that was so lovely that it made it hard for
me to be ‚Äúin the spirit‚Äù when I looked at her.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The druggist, a big fellow who sang in the choir, was their first
notable conquest, and he came down from the choir-loft one night, and
in his testimony announced he was going to live for the glory of God,
hereafter; and would burn all his pipes and tobacco in his store the
next day.</Sentence> <Sentence>This started a chorus of ‚ÄúAmens‚Äù and ‚ÄúHallelujahs.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hornsberg leaned over and said to me in a loud whisper, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve
lost your beau!</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Mooney, the preacher girls have cut you out!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The druggist had come out on two occasions and taken me driving with a
livery team; I did not know how to refuse when he came, and besides a
drive was pleasant on a quiet Sunday afternoon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wasn‚Äôt worrying
about him, the girls could have him.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when I went to town one
evening after school intending to stay for the meeting, and passed
Maud walking with the boy from the drug store, so deeply engrossed in
each other, they did not even see me, I got a distinctly unpleasant
feeling.</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course I knew their conversation was on a highly spiritual
plane, but even so, she did not need to look up into his face so
often; and I knew how shattering those brown eyes could be.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I felt very awkward all at once, and a bit shabby and gawky, and very
much a country girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>What chance had I against these dangerous eyes
with the purple depths, and those well-cut clothes.</Sentence> . . .?

<Sentence>Not that I cared, I told myself, loftily.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was nothing to me.</Sentence> . . .
<Sentence>I was never going to marry anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>I did not go to the drug store as I
had intended.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went to W. D. Ruttan‚Äôs store, and bought a new coat
and hat, intending to wear them to the meeting, but changed my mind
about that, too, and went home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had my own horse then, a sorrel saddle-horse, which I had bought
from the mail-carrier, Johnny Moorehouse.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was never so glad to have
a horse of my own as I was that night.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some way the independence I
felt in this possession did much to restore me.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had had to walk
home that night, I might have mired down in a bog of self-pity.</Sentence>

<Sentence>As I rode home slowly, I reasoned with myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was all for the
best.</Sentence> <Sentence>I must avoid all complications.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had work to do.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was going to
write, I must travel alone‚Äîalways alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>I told myself everything but
the truth, which was that I was bitterly jealous of the dark-eyed,
charming Maud.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The revival began with the burning of the pipes.</Sentence> <Sentence>Crowds came to the
church every night, and dozens came to the altar.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every Sunday morning
people joined the church, prayer-meetings were held in the afternoons;
even the country people were moved.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went back to the meetings in a
few days.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew a great work was being done.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted to help; I had
a high exalted feeling now, of bearing my cross, and a much less
exalted, but infinitely happier feeling that Maud would soon be on her
way, and life would settle back into its pleasant ways.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The conservative element, Presbyterians and Anglicans, kept away from
the meetings, and were outspoken in their disapproval.</Sentence> <Sentence>They warned the
people to stay away.</Sentence> <Sentence>They foresaw disaster in the excitement of the
altar calls and conversions.</Sentence> <Sentence>They recounted cases of insanity that
they had known of, and these criticisms were answered by Nettie, in
her gentle words, ‚ÄúWe do well to be excited,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúover the
greatest thing in life.</Sentence> <Sentence>Religion is greater than a horse-race, or a
football game, or an election.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Excitement and emotions which
have no outlet are dangerous, I know, but religion gives an outlet.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Christ said, ‚ÄòFeed the hungry, clothe the naked, preach the gospel to
the poor.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô Have you any hungry, or naked, or poor, or erring, or
discouraged, or lonely, or sad, among you?</Sentence> <Sentence>If so, then don‚Äôt worry
about an outlet for your emotion, pour out your new-found love on
these.</Sentence> <Sentence>Cry if you wish, over your sins!</Sentence> <Sentence>There is no water so holy as
the tear of a penitent sinner.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>In spite of all opposition the meetings grew in numbers and interest,
and the whole neighborhood was shaken.</Sentence> <Sentence>Family quarrels were made up,
old debts paid, drunkards reformed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Churches were crowded, bar-rooms
emptied.</Sentence> <Sentence>We saw these miracles.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew then why the temperance chart
had failed.</Sentence> <Sentence>It had shown certain facts, as true as the multiplication
tables, and given warnings; but it had been powerless to supply the
will-power to heed these warnings.</Sentence> <Sentence>It showed the right way, but had no
power to make people choose the right way.</Sentence> <Sentence>It appealed to the head
alone, and because of this it failed.</Sentence> <Sentence>This, then, was the secret of
religion.</Sentence> <Sentence>It gave strength to the weak, life to the dead; it made
people want to do the right thing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We started a Sunday School at our school, and old and young came.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Saturday night rides were over; and a new spirit came to our
neighborhood.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I have spoken of the wife of the town drunkard, who did not want to
vote because that wish would reflect on her husband.</Sentence> <Sentence>She, of course,
being the saint of our community, attended the meetings, and early in
them asked for the prayers of God‚Äôs people for her husband.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was
there the night she stood up and made this plea.</Sentence> <Sentence>A tall, pale husk of
a woman, whose shabby clothes hung on her as they would on a clothes
horse.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt for her a sort of pity, that was mixed with contempt.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She was such a door-mat; she even washed for the hotel-keeper‚Äôs wife,
to pay old Silas‚Äô liquor bills.</Sentence> <Sentence>And, needless to say, I lost no time
in praying for Silas.</Sentence> <Sentence>I mean I did not pray for him; but Silas did
very well without my prayers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One night Silas was converted with all the emotion that went with a
prodigal son‚Äôs return.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a fine looking man, and being something
of a show-man, missed none of the fireworks.</Sentence> <Sentence>He confessed he had been
a lazy bum, letting his wife support him‚Äîand she had been a
long-suffering angel; and he said he was through with liquor forever;
‚Äúso help me God.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I do not think many believed him, they knew him too well, or thought
they did.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we can take the long view of Silas Brand‚Äôs case now, for
that was forty years ago, and all the returns are in; the books are
closed and nothing can hurt his record now.</Sentence> <Sentence>He went to work the day
after his conversion, in a lumber yard.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was received in the church
the next Sunday morning on confession of faith.</Sentence> <Sentence>He became a new man;
with a new countenance, and one of that district‚Äôs best loved
citizens.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Not long ago, one of his sons whom I had taught, sent me a paper in
which his father‚Äôs death was recorded, and in the obituary, written by
the United Church minister of the little town, were these words:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHe was soundly converted many years ago, in revival meetings
conducted by the Misses Judd, in Manitou, and his zeal for the work of
God knew no languor.</Sentence> <Sentence>His memory in this neighborhood will ever be a
happy one.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The conversions did not all last.</Sentence> <Sentence>All the grains, even of wheat, that
most enduring and vital of seeds, do not grow.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before the end of the month it became evident that Nettie Judd would
have to take a rest.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was growing paler and thinner before our
eyes; a cough often shook her frail little body.</Sentence> <Sentence>The minister‚Äôs wife
said Nettie did not take care of herself; did not wear warm clothing;
did not sleep enough, did not seem to care whether she lived or died,
belonged too much to the other world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The girls went from Manitou to Pilot <Location>Mound</Location> and <Location>Crystal City</Location>, and
conducted meetings with the same spectacular results.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then suddenly
the flickering torch was blown out.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nettie died.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was only twenty-six years old.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not a long life, as we
reckon time.</Sentence> <Sentence>But she influenced many.</Sentence> <Sentence>She burned the candle at both
ends, but it certainly made a bright and beautiful light while it
lasted, and lighted many a stumbling soul into the way of life
everlasting.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Maud went back to <Location>Ontario</Location> with the little coffin.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember how she
looked standing on the back platform of the train, as it wound up the
grade, dressed in a rough gray coat with capes, a little red cap on
her curls, waving to us, a long good-bye.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stood there, a sad little group, awed by the presence of death, and
yet exalted too.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew the Heavenly Portals had opened wide when
Nettie went in, and it seemed that some of the glory was shining
around us as we lingered.</Sentence> <Sentence>A spring snow was falling in big flakes, and
the train was rapidly fading into the gray distance as it pulled up
the grade past Luke Armstrong‚Äôs.</Sentence> <Sentence>We watched it still, and did not move
until it had gone from sight.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then, without speaking, we turned and
crossed the tracks to go back.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I turned at the Ellis‚Äô house corner to go up <Location>Front Street</Location>, to
Curistons‚Äô Livery Stable, where I had left my horse.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt a gentle
pressure on my arm, and you would never guess who was walking with me!</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXV‚ÄîI Saw E. Cora Hind</Sentence>


<Sentence>Miss Hind‚Äôs visit to Manitou came during my second year in Hazel
School.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The _Manitou Mercury_ carried a news item which caused me to press my
green dress, blacken my shoes, and iron out my black veil with the
green dots.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMiss E. Cora Hind of <Location>Winnipeg</Location> will arrive on Saturday‚Äôs train to
visit her friend, Mrs. W. D. Ruttan.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew about Miss Hind.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had been the first lady typist in
<Location>Winnipeg</Location>, having come there as a very young girl from Flesherton,
<Location>Ontario</Location>; and now she was on the staff of the _Free Press_.</Sentence> <Sentence>She wrote
signed articles, interviews, spoke in public and I had seen her
picture and knew she was a striking figure of a woman, well-dressed,
and impressive.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I would see Miss Hind, maybe I would get a chance to speak to her for
I knew Mrs. Ruttan.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would go to the station on Saturday.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were
always many people at the station, for the trains crossed in Manitou,
and that hour between twelve and one was the peak of the village life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I arrived at Curiston‚Äôs Livery stable and put my horse away, I
found I had plenty of time; the trains would not come for half an
hour, but people were going down the sidewalk past John Woottons‚Äô
store on one corner and the Ellis House on the other.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was rather too bad that the trains came together.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one could
watch both trains arriving; the East train from <Location>Winnipeg</Location> slipping
easily down the grade, almost noiselessly, with its smoke blown back
on its shoulders by the prevailing west wind; and the other bound for
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> with its smoke standing high over the engine, laboring up the
track.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it gave us a feeling that great events were breaking at our
feet when the two great messengers of commerce stood for four minutes
heavily breathing as they disgorged passengers, express parcels and
mail.</Sentence> <Sentence>And how busy and important the station agent and his assistant
were handing out orders to both conductors, while we could hear the
telegraph instruments left alone in the office still talking to
themselves in sudden rushes of clattering sounds.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Everyone who could, came to the station on that Saturday morning, even
Mrs. Barnes from the section house came over with her apron turned
behind her to show that though she came from her work and would return
to her work, for the moment she had left all menial tasks behind her.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The butcher, knowing that business paused for the trains to pass, came
hastily down the sidewalk, bare-headed, with his suit coat on over his
once-white apron; a farmer‚Äôs boy drove rapidly down the street with
his foot hanging out of the buckboard just to show that he was
socially at ease and that coming to town was an old story to him; tied
his horse in front of Duncan Gunn‚Äôs store and came jauntily over the
tracks with his hat on one side of his head.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Soon we saw the smoke of the East train.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was coming!</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Hind, I
mean.</Sentence> <Sentence>In a minute or two I would see her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Ruttan was talking to a
group of women, and I had not been able to catch a word with her.</Sentence> <Sentence>In
my wildest dreams I had believed it possible she might ask me to come
to see Miss Hind.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remembered that Mrs. Ruttan had once said that I
should be in the choir, for she thought I had a good contralto
voice.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äî‚ÄîI wondered if I dared go over and speak to her now.</Sentence> <Sentence>The crowd
gathered and swarmed across the platform.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I heard one woman say, ‚ÄúIf the west train is late I declare I won‚Äôt
wait.</Sentence> <Sentence>Yesterday it was so late my potatoes got burned.</Sentence> <Sentence>I gave them
plenty of water today but Tom likes them cooked with a bone in
them.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I do wish the C.P.R. would give us a decent train time.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
The train came sliding in noiselessly and the passenger coach stopped
in front of me.</Sentence> <Sentence>My chance of speaking to Mrs. Ruttan was gone now but
at least I would see Miss Hind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There she was.</Sentence> <Sentence>No mistake, a young woman in a tan tweed suit with
brown facings; a little hat to match with a saucy quill set at exactly
the right angle; and a scarf with flaring ends.</Sentence> <Sentence>She looked over the
heads of the people who were descending the steps, picked out Mrs.
Ruttan and waved to her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her face had a fresh and lovely color and her
fine dark blue eyes beamed with health and friendliness‚Äîa break in the
crowd gave me a full view of her as she stepped briskly down the
steps, with her small square leather bag in her hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then it was I
saw her little feet so trimly shod in russet leather shoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
never seen prettier shoes.</Sentence> <Sentence>The crowd drew back making an aisle for
her, closing in behind as she passed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to follow her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted Mrs. Ruttan to speak to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>But a
sudden shyness had fallen on me, the shyness of the country girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
think it was those twinkling russet shoes of hers.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mine were black
goat skin, peeled and a little bit dull; also buttoned and gaping a
bit at the top‚ÄîI should have moved the top buttons over but had never
thought of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could not make a move, and quite miserably I watched
Mrs. Ruttan and her guest crossing the track; Mrs. Ruttan insisting
against Miss Hind‚Äôs protest on carrying the little square brown bag.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
heard her say she had checked her big valise.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tommy Coolidge, the
drayman, would deliver it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I saw Mrs. Ruttan give him the check and I
thought with longing of the treasures of attire it would hold.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
watched them until they went in Mr. Ruttan‚Äôs store.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had seen her!</Sentence> <Sentence>I had seen what a newspaper woman could be at her
shining best.</Sentence> <Sentence>Like the sad little girl of whom Katherine Mansfield
wrote in the _Doll‚Äôs Playhouse_, I could say, ‚ÄúI seen the lamp.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before I went back to my boarding house I went to the post office and
wrote to the Richardson Book Store in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> for a book on shorthand
believing as so many people did then, that this was the key to success
in newspaper work.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXVI‚ÄîMy First Political Meeting</Sentence>


<Sentence>When I recall how little we knew or cared about public matters I
cannot be critical of the young people of today.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I attended one political meeting in Manitou about this time and would
not have been there but for the persuasion of Mrs. Brown, whom I met
in Huston‚Äôs store.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Brown, who was a widow, lived about four miles
out of town and had come in to do her Saturday shopping, had heard of
the meeting and decided to stay for it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She asked me to do the same
and offered to drive me back to my boarding house when it was over.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
had my own horse then and so could get home myself but her offer to
drive me out impressed me, I wondered why she was so anxious to have
me attend the meeting.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew about Mrs. Brown.</Sentence> <Sentence>The women admired her, but the men I had
heard speak of her were critical of her and resented her independent
ways.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a tall, angular woman with a weather beaten face,
criss-crossed with tiny lines, blue eyes and a pleasant crisp voice.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúThe women here are asleep,‚Äù she said to me, as we walked about
waiting for eight o‚Äôclock.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBeing all right themselves they care
little for other women.</Sentence> <Sentence>The comfortably married woman is the most
selfish person in the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve asked dozens of them to come with me
to this meeting, I asked everyone I saw after I heard of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>You‚Äôd
laugh to hear the excuses.</Sentence> <Sentence>They had to give Billy a bath, or they had
to blacken the family boots, or their husband‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt like it.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
are afraid to make an independent move.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I saw you and I had a
sudden gleam of hope.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had heard something about you that sounded
original.</Sentence> <Sentence>Is it true that you have two boys at your school who were
always fighting, and you got tired of it and made them fight it out
one day to get the matter settled?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I admitted it, but hastened to explain it was not so bad as it
sounded.</Sentence> <Sentence>There had been nothing more serious than nose-bleeds apiece,
and one black-eye; and peace had settled down on the playground since
and the boys were good friends.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWell, I liked that,‚Äù said Mrs. Brown.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt revealed an original cast
of mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I‚Äôm glad you will come with me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve tried very hard to
rouse women and failed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe I can get you interested and you‚Äôll do
something.</Sentence> <Sentence>Who knows?</Sentence> <Sentence>Anyway I am going to risk the price of a dinner
on you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I protested that, but she insisted, and at a boarding house on the
front street, facing the tracks, we ate at a little oilcloth covered
table, in a dark corner; and Mrs. Brown explained to me why she wanted
women to vote and be members of school boards and go to Parliament,
and take their place in the community.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI knew nothing of business until my husband died,‚Äù she said in her
even voice, ‚ÄúI was a nice girl equipped for life, my poor mother
thought.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could bake, sew, play the organ, and recite the ‚ÄòEvening
Hymn,‚Äô and had made quilts, and a seed-wreath.</Sentence> <Sentence>But what good does that
do me now, when I am the head of a house with five little children
depending on me?</Sentence> <Sentence>I have to do a man‚Äôs work, as well as a woman‚Äôs, and
in doing that I have found out a few things.</Sentence> <Sentence>Men are afraid of women,
jealous of them, and unfair to them.</Sentence> <Sentence>They want women to be
looking-glasses, howbeit false ones that make them look bigger than
they are.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even my little boys want me to watch them when they are
sleigh-riding down the hill.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúEspecially strong in most men is their dislike of women, who know
more than they do.</Sentence> <Sentence>I taught a hired man a new wrinkle about ploughing
and he left me, he said he wasn‚Äôt going to be bossed by a woman, and
the neighbors thought he did exactly the right thing.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>They would
do more for me if I were a helpless, pretty, little thing who would
burst into tears.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I cried plenty the first year I was left
alone, and everyone was very kind to me then.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now, that I am really
trying to run my farm and look after my family I met plenty of
opposition.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>But I can‚Äôt keep on crying, even to get help.</Sentence> <Sentence>How I
hate that song, ‚ÄòMen must work and women must weep.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô I can work like a
man, I can plough, and run a binder .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and believe me, my girls
will get a man‚Äôs education.</Sentence> <Sentence>They won‚Äôt be left helplessly floundering
like I was.</Sentence> . . .

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe have to get the vote on account of the laws.</Sentence> <Sentence>In <Location>Ontario</Location> a woman
has some claim on her husband‚Äôs property, but none here.</Sentence> <Sentence>That was
changed because of Indian wives.</Sentence> <Sentence>The poor Indian women were cut off
from any claim on a man‚Äôs property.</Sentence> <Sentence>They said they had to do away with
the wife‚Äôs claim too, on account of the boom in 1882 when property was
changing hands so fast.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it won‚Äôt be set right until women vote.</Sentence>
<Sentence>You‚Äôll see.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs a man-made world, young lady, as you will find.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even nature
works against women, by making them smaller and weaker, giving them
all the human ailments, and a few of their own; and society has taken
up the good work by laying heavier obligations on women and a higher
standard of morality.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúBut there are compensations,‚Äù I protested.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWomen lead a more
sheltered life.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYes, on paper,‚Äù she said sadly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI did not know what life could do to
a woman until I was left.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a good home, and a good husband.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
homes pass and husbands die.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Well, I shouldn‚Äôt be so mournful
with you and so discouraging.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am not so badly off as some.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would
rather have a good husband dead than a bad one living!</Sentence> <Sentence>I am grateful
for all my blessings, good children, and good health.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went to the meeting in the Town Hall, where the Hon.</Sentence> <Sentence>Thomas
Greenway was speaking.</Sentence> <Sentence>He commented on our appearance and said he was
glad to see at least two women in the audience.</Sentence> <Sentence>Politics concerned
women as much as men, though he did not think women would ever need to
actually take part in politics.</Sentence> <Sentence>But their influence was needed and
never more so than at this time.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the woman‚Äôs place to see that
their men folk voted and voted right and this he said (so even we
could understand), meant voting Liberal; which brought applause from
the audience.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Brown and I had written out two questions and signed them as we
sat at the oilcloth covered table in the boarding house.</Sentence>

(1) <Sentence>Are you in favor of extending the Franchise to women?</Sentence> <Sentence>If so when
may we expect to have this privilege?</Sentence>

(2) <Sentence>Are you in favor of women having homesteading rights, and if so,
will you ask the Dominion Government to consider this?</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a collection taken to defray expenses and we put our
questions on the plate along with our contributions.</Sentence> <Sentence>We saw the
chairman read the questions and show them to Mr. Greenway, who laughed
good-naturedly when he read them and looked down at us with a sort of
fatherly rebuke in his eyes!</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a fine figure of a man with a
full, brown beard, a well-shaped head, and a merry smile.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then there
were more whispers, the other speaker was consulted and he took the
questions, read them, and shook his head.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then the chairman put the
paper in his pocket, from which it was never recovered and we were
sorry then that we had given our two quarters.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We stayed and listened, not greatly interested in what was said.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
other party, it seemed, had well nigh ruined the country.</Sentence> <Sentence>It had been
put out just in the nick of time.</Sentence> <Sentence>Another term would have been fatal.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They must be kept out!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The meeting closed with feeble cheers for the Premier and I think
everyone was glad when it was over.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Brown and I were not spoken to, though I saw men whom I knew, and
she, no doubt, knew many.</Sentence> <Sentence>But they charitably ignored us.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We parted at the livery stable, where she too had left her horse.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
were indignant at our chilly reception but undismayed and full of
plans for further advances.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when I got away from Mrs. Brown my
enthusiasm for political life began to wane.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was a sordid, grubby
business, judging by this dull meeting with its stale air, and I was
uncomfortable all the time I sat in it, knowing we were not wanted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I rode home through the dark night wondering about what I had heard.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The sorrel horse knew his way, without any guidance.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Many of the
houses were in darkness, for country people go to their beds early
even on Saturday night.</Sentence> <Sentence>As I passed Ben Cook‚Äôs house I heard the
mournful notes of a fiddle.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ben and Henry his brother lived at the
turn of the road in a little square unpainted house, and did their own
cooking.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I had skated with them on the lake near their farm the
fall before, when we took advantage of the ice before the snow came,
and gathered at the lake on the moonlight nights, making fires of
driftwood on the shore.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could hear the violin notes long after I
passed‚Äîthey followed me down the dark trail.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ben had been one of the
converts at the Judd revival and he played and sang one of the revival
hymns now:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúJesus Saviour, pilot me
  Over life‚Äôs tempestuous sea.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The sweet words, drifting out into the night, gave me a sense of
security.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I thought of the Judd sisters then, and their work, and how they had
changed the color of people‚Äôs thoughts across <Location>southern Manitoba</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Marrying and raising children was not the only thing a woman could do;
even in that how unfair life and society were to women; laying all
responsibility on them and giving them no training for their work, and
then if they made mistakes punishing them beyond all reason.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I
thought of Louie Smith, poor Louie, who by some mischance had fallen a
victim to the wiles of Tom Preston, the bad man of our neighborhood.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She had been loyal to him through all, and refused to talk, bearing
all the blame.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And Tom still went at large, driving his pacing horse, with his heavy
gold watch chain dangling with charms straight across his vest; while
Louie had not been off her father‚Äôs farm since and ran for cover when
any one approached.</Sentence> <Sentence>No one had held out a kindly hand to Louie nor had
pity on her innocence.</Sentence> <Sentence>Louie had sinned!</Sentence> <Sentence>She had fallen.</Sentence> <Sentence>How cruel the
world was!</Sentence> <Sentence>How cruel we all were!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I raged in my mind when I thought of her, a fine happy, healthy girl a
few months before, weeding a pansy bed, clean and as sweet as a pansy
herself in her print dress and sunbonnet, now a prisoner on her
father‚Äôs farm, a fugitive from society.</Sentence> <Sentence>Just a pale, fleeting face
seen at an upstairs window .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>doomed to a life of unending and
unrelieved labor, for one moment‚Äôs yielding, and even the church had
not spoken out against this injustice.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had take my knee off the
pommel and sat straight on the saddle to rest myself and when I
thought of Louie I dug my heels into the sorrel horse in my intense
indignation, and he, taken by surprise, plunged and bolted for home
clattering noisily down the trail with the stirrups lashing him,
leaving me on the side of the road.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was not hurt for I fell on the grassy roadside and I was not far
from my destination.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hoped my friends had gone to bed, and so would
not know that the sorrel had come home without me.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had been
riding the right and natural way astride the horse this could not have
happened.</Sentence> <Sentence>A side-saddle is surely the last word in discomfort for both
the rider and the horse; another example of life‚Äôs injustice to women
I thought as I hastened along through the dark.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Everyone was safely in bed and the horse had gone to the gate, which
led to the farmyard and stood there with his head down.</Sentence> <Sentence>I unsaddled
him and put him into his stall.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then let myself into the unlocked
kitchen, smelling pleasantly of spicy cooking and dimly lighted by the
lantern which Mrs. Hornsberg had left burning for me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Hornsberg
always baked on Saturday afternoon for Sunday.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had left on the
kitchen table sliced headcheese, cranberry catsup and fresh buns, and
butter and I forgot the sorrows of my sex for the next few minutes,
for I was healthily hungry.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I had eaten my good humor came back.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was good to be back in
this cheerful warm kitchen with its reassuring orderliness.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went into the room where Esther was sleeping and brought out the
‚ÄúGiant‚Äù Scribbler where I kept my diary and made an entry detailing
the events of the day.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I went on: ‚ÄúI do not want to be a
reformer,‚Äù I wrote, ‚ÄúI will do my share of the work of the world some
other way.</Sentence> <Sentence>I want a big friendly house, white and glistening, under
great spreading trees with a huge fireplace in the hall which will
send out a welcome to the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>Inside there will be a long table set
with gleaming silver and china with rosebuds and when my friends
gather there they will look through wide windows at the pageant of the
sunset, saffron, rose and flame, and when the night comes down fading
the sky to ashy grey the fireflies will stipple the purple dusk of the
garden with their dots and dashes and there will be good talk and a
great fellowship.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, I do not want to be a reformer and sit in a dull
meeting where the air is dead and stale and everyone wondering what I
came for.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Agnes Wakefield, <Location>Florence</Location> Doombey, Ruth Pinch did not
attend political meetings.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still I must remember that they lived a
long time ago and this is a new country.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wonder what C. D. would
have thought of Mrs. Brown.</Sentence> <Sentence>Well, I admire her anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>She has stood
up to life.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I decided to sell my horse when I found I could not break him of the
habit of bolting for the livery stable every time I rode to town.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
had wintered the year before at Curiston‚Äôs livery barn, and when he
came to the foot of that street he began to act like a cat that sees a
bed of catnip.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had hoped he would give up the struggle, but he held
to the hope he would one day be able to throw me and get back.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then, of course, I thought of George, who could always use another
horse, and who never failed to help any of his friends.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wrote to
George and he came down to see me and the horse.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had paid
seventy-five dollars for the sorrel; so George gave me ninety and took
him off my hands.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wish all my financial adventures had ended so happily.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXVII‚ÄîManitou</Sentence>


<Sentence>A vacancy occurred in the Manitou School at the end of that year and I
sent in an application, hardly hoping, but Inspector E. E. Best had
given me two good reports and had said I was one of the best
disciplinarians in his Inspectorate, and no doubt I received the
appointment on his recommendation.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were four teachers in Manitou
School, and my room was next the Principal‚Äôs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The school was a grim frame building at the east of the little town,
with two rooms up and two down, a hard, worn school-yard, unfenced and
unrelieved by tree or flower.</Sentence> <Sentence>The countryside rolled away to the east
and south, dotted with farm buildings and clumps of trees, leafless
now in January, and swept by wintry winds and brightened only by the
new yellow strawstacks and the red and white cattle that foraged
through them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But Manitou was a centre of learning, for we had the Normal School
there, one of the three Normal Schools in the province, and the second
week I was there, Normal students were sent to each room to watch us
teach.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was all very flattering, but embarrassing too.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wished.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
could be more like Miss Nimmons of the Carleton School in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> and
be really able to show them the art of teaching.</Sentence> <Sentence>My pupils ranged in
age from twelve to eighteen.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was boarding at the parsonage and that was really the highlight of
my coming to town.</Sentence> <Sentence>The parsonage was a small frame house facing south,
quite near the school.</Sentence> <Sentence>The front door opened into the parlor and
beyond the parlor was the dining-room, with a kitchen and woodshed to
the right.</Sentence> <Sentence>An open stairs in the dining-room led to three bedrooms
upstairs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The McClung family had come from <Location>Port Arthur</Location> and the junior members
were still bewailing the change.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. and Mrs. McClung were ready at
any time to accept the ruling of the Stationing Committee of the
Methodist Church, even if it took them to the <Location>North Pole</Location>; though I
know they found our little prairie town bleak and barren after the
scenic beauty of the head of the Lakes.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Wes and Nellie, Herb and Ed let no sentimental attachment to the
church of their fathers put a curb on their tongues, and they mourned
for the companions and beauties they had been forced to leave.</Sentence> <Sentence>Besides
they found the prairie winter very cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>Having known nothing but
prairie winters, I did not know any better, and wondered why they made
such a fuss when a pail of water froze to the bottom or frost gathered
on the walls an inch thick.</Sentence> <Sentence>That winter of 1892 was a particularly
cold one, but I was so glad to have only a hundred yards to go to
school that the weather mattered but little to me.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>McClung made a good minister for a scattered flock, for he had all
the conquering fire of the circuit rider.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had three services each
Sunday; morning and evening, in his own church, and Kingsley and
Kaleida on alternate Sundays in the afternoon.</Sentence> <Sentence>These appointments were
ten or twelve miles out, and no weather, however, disagreeable, kept
him at home.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wes, the boy in the drug store, went with him to drive
the horse when the weather was stormy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I will admit (though it would have been considered an unmaidenly
confession at that time) that I was much influenced in my desire to
teach in Manitou by the presence of the minister‚Äôs eldest son.</Sentence> <Sentence>I felt
sure Mrs. McClung‚Äôs son must be the sort of man I would like.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had
all the sweetness, charm and beauty of the old-fashioned woman, and in
addition to this had a fearless, and even radical, mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been to
the parsonage quite a few times before I came to board there; and I
saw the methods of training her children.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her one girl, Nellie, who
was my age, did no more than one share of the work; being a girl, did
not sentence her to all the dishwashing and bedmaking.</Sentence> <Sentence>The two younger
boys took their turn and there were no complaints from them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wes, of
course, worked long hours in the drug store, and so he was immune from
chores.</Sentence> <Sentence>On the other hand, Nellie had no special favors because she
was a girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there was no talk of having to be accompanied by a
brother every time she went out.</Sentence>

<Sentence>All this I liked, and while I was still profoundly serious in my
determination to travel the highway of life alone, giving myself to
the world of letters, I liked this tall slim young man of twenty very
well indeed, and was glad of a chance to see him at close range.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He told me one day that I was the brightest find of their life, since
leaving <Location>Port Arthur</Location>, but knowing what they thought of the prairie, I
did not feel greatly elated.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would have to do better than that.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I loved the life in this little town, and have always resented the
condescension with which many people view the small country town.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There were many advantages.</Sentence> <Sentence>I began to take music lessons from Miss
Clarke, and painting lessons from Miss Victoria Mortson, who had a
class in the upstairs parlor at the hotel, where the proprietor‚Äôs
relatives (deceased, I think) looked stonily down on us from their
heavy oak frames.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had a teachers‚Äô meeting every Friday evening
after four, conducted by the principal.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then there were forty Normalites in circulation, and we had to do what
we could to guide their young feet into the pleasant paths of
learning.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Besides all this, we often had parties on Friday nights, especially I
remember the surprise parties to houses in the country.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did not go
unless we were invited, of course, but the night was left open, and
the arrangements were made quickly.</Sentence> <Sentence>The young men found sleighs and
horses, and the girls provided the refreshments; salmon sandwiches,
cakes, a can of coffee, and we were off.</Sentence> <Sentence>All the seats were taken out
of the sleigh and plenty of hay put in, covered with robes, with more
robes above, and we were young enough to sit comfortably on our heels
if necessary.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember the moonlight nights, frosty and cold, when the stars
seemed twice their natural size in the deep, bright blue of the sky,
and the lights in the houses we passed, shone warm and yellow on the
snow, blurred by the frost ferns on the windows.</Sentence> <Sentence>We found the Dipper
and the North Star and the Bear while the sleigh bells rang out their
silvery music, and we were uproariously, unreasonably happy just to be
alive and part of life.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we arrived, what fun we had playing the guessing game, where one
person thinks of something and the others ask questions that can only
be answered by ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember how Jessie McEwen, one of the
teachers, held us at bay for a long time at the surprise party at
Susie Laidlaw‚Äôs, when she thought of Mr. Harrison‚Äôs nose.</Sentence> <Sentence>We found by
our questioning that it couldn‚Äôt be bought or carried away; had been
given to the owner; was not as big as a cow; could not be eaten; moved
about freely, and did not belong to anyone present but was well known
by all and admired by some.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was no pairing off at our parties‚Äîthat was understood, but
sometimes, coming home, when the moon was low in the sky, looking a
bit weary from shining so hard all evening; and when the cold had
deepened as the night wore on, there might be a little holding of
hands when we sang ‚ÄúGenevieve, Sweet Genevieve‚Äù or ‚ÄúSweet Marie‚Äù.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Nellie Wallen often had cold hands, but not for long.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had no telephones, picture-shows, radios, phonographs, daily papers
or lending libraries.</Sentence> <Sentence>We made our own fun‚Äîand we had plenty‚Äîthe sort
of fun you can remember for forty years and find it still warms your
heart.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I have lived in several small towns, but I have not known any other
place that had such a decided flavor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Manitou was engaging,
unexpected, and altogether adventurous.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was half-way between
<Location>Winnipeg</Location> and <Location>Deloraine</Location> on the southwestern branch of the C.P.R., had
been settled since 1882, and had held its early settlers, who, unlike
the people in many prairie towns, had come to stay.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first winter I was there the W.C.T.U. opened a reading room and
amusement room, and it became a gathering place for the intelligentsia
after four and on Saturday afternoons.</Sentence> <Sentence>I do not know how we managed to
be heard above the clatter from the outside room, where there were
three croquinole boards always in use, but we were young and lusty and
could raise our voices.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had hastily arranged unofficial debates,
and could have coffee sent up to us in honest, thick, white cups from
the restaurant below, at two cups for five cents, just to give the
conversation a continental flavor, and as we argued on annexation with
the <Location>United States</Location> or the relative value of science or literature in
the schools, or whether or not it is possible to live without sin, we
felt that we were living in the best tradition of the coffee houses of
<Location>London</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Manitou‚Äôs weekly paper, _The Mercury_, edited by R. H. Spedding, was
an event each week.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the advertisements tingled with excitement.</Sentence>
<Sentence>When one store, wishing to show its popularity, stated in a big
headline, ‚ÄúThree men killed in the jam at our Saturday bargains!</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù, the
other store came out with the assurance ‚ÄúThere are no dead men in our
jam.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù The swift action of changing their ads each week wore away at
last, and there came a time later when one ad ran from early August to
January.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was Billy M‚Äî‚Äî‚Äòs confectionery news, and what was a
timely ad in August read queerly when the bitter north wind scoured
the frozen streets, and the chief problem of life was to keep the
furnaces roaring: ‚ÄúPreserving season is now open,‚Äù and ‚ÄúKeep Kool at
all Kosts, with a Kwart of Ice Kream.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even our undertakers had personalities of their own.</Sentence> <Sentence>One of them has
what he called a ‚ÄúSkidoodle‚Äù of prices.</Sentence> <Sentence>The other one always invited
the friends at funerals to ‚ÄúCome now, and look your last on the
‚Äòdiseased‚Äô.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The country around Manitou with its rolling prairie and beautiful
unfenced lands, was an ideal spot for the training of game-dogs, and
four of our citizens had large kennels of Llewellyn setters of great
beauty and value.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the dogs were taken out to the fields, many
people went to see their performance.</Sentence> <Sentence>The dogs ranged back and forth
at right angles to the wind, racing at high speed, and with a graceful
flowing motion, to get the scent, then with shorter runs, weaving up
the wind to make the point.</Sentence> <Sentence>When a dog reached the place of close
scent he suddenly stopped as rigid as if turned to stone, one front
paw in mid-air, and his head and tail in line with the bird which,
though hidden in the grass, he had located accurately by the scent.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
would stand there, a picture of grace and concentration, until
released by a word from his master.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Dogs came from as far away as <Location>Kentucky</Location> to be trained on the Manitou
fields, but the Field Trials were held at Morris and Letellier where
the wide and level grass lands along the <Location>Red River</Location> allowed the judges
to watch the work of the dogs as they ranged for a mile or more.</Sentence> <Sentence>At
the contests the dogs were set down from the crates in pairs, and the
test was made between the two.</Sentence> <Sentence>The better dog was the one which made
the wide range acting independently of his master, in his zeal to find
a bird, though to pass a scent which was picked up by his competitor
gave a dog a very bad mark.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the point was made, it must be held
until his master arrived.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then at a word the dog, still rigid and
pointing, advanced toward the bird, flushing it for the shoot.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the
Field Trials which were held just before the shooting season, there
was no shooting of birds, and the dogs must have wondered why all
their good work came to nothing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Manitou dogs were sometimes taken to <Location>Kentucky</Location> and other southern
states to compete, and one of Mr. Wootton‚Äôs dogs, ‚ÄúDick Blondell‚Äù,
made a great win one year and had his picture in the _Manitou Mercury_
and, no doubt, in many other papers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I remember one <Location>Kentucky</Location> dog-owner, a perfect colonial with pointed
beard and leather leggings and delightfully soft voice, who came for
several seasons, bringing his wife with him.</Sentence> <Sentence>The colonel had a great
fascination for the young crowd, for there was a rumor, unconfirmed
but none the less believed, that he had killed a man!</Sentence> <Sentence>But if he had,
there was no trace of remorse in his placid countenance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One of the Manitou dog-owners, whose kennels were behind his office on
the main street, played a violin, not well, but persistently, and
often far into the night.</Sentence> <Sentence>And sometimes when he had teased the strings
into a state of cataphonics, the dogs lifted up their voices too, and
the other kennels responded until the little town rang dismally.</Sentence> <Sentence>For a
long time no one protested.</Sentence> <Sentence>The game-dogs were part of our village
life.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when one of the early settlers went back to his home in the
East and married his old sweetheart who had been waiting for twenty
years for him to make up his mind, she, accustomed to the sterile
silence of that respectable little hamlet on the <Location>Ottawa River</Location>, made
loud protests against the dogs and even wrote a letter to the paper
about them.</Sentence> <Sentence>We thought it very strange of her to object.</Sentence> <Sentence>How did she
think dogs could always be kept quiet?</Sentence> <Sentence>Of course we had to remember
that she probably had never, in her under-privileged life, seen a bird
dog turn to stone!</Sentence> <Sentence>We who knew the dogs and appreciated them were
divided into two classes‚Äîthose who said they never heard the dogs, and
those who said they liked to hear them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a young Englishman, who lived in the <Location>Pembina Valley</Location>, twelve
miles south of Manitou, who had been sent to <Location>Canada</Location> to cure him of his
drinking habits, but with two hard-working bars twelve miles away, the
usual number of thirsty ones ready to drink with him‚Äîand no
restrictions on the sale of liquor‚Äîhe went on from bad to worse.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
one day, in a furniture store in Manitou, he got into an altercation
with the proprietor, who was an old man, and, in his drunken fury,
struck Mr. Rossman and knocked him down.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he became sober and knew
what he had done, he declared he would never drink again.</Sentence> <Sentence>We knew him
for twenty years after that and he kept his word.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was another young Englishman in the Valley who had been sent
away from home because he was not very bright, and ‚Äúfather‚Äù did not
like to look at him.</Sentence> <Sentence>So he was exiled.</Sentence> <Sentence>His people had plenty of money
and supplied him with blankets, guns, knives, saddles‚Äîeverything but
the one thing he craved‚Äîpermission to go home.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had been out three
years before he dared to ask permission that he might go home, even
for one day.</Sentence> <Sentence>We all waited for the answer‚Äîand hoped.</Sentence> <Sentence>The answer came
at last.</Sentence> <Sentence>No, he could not come back; but his mother sent him a book,
‚ÄúTwenty-three ways of playing Solitaire.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was the young Miss C‚Äî‚Äî who had mothered the family since her
mother died years ago, but who had always cherished the hope that she
would some day get her chance.</Sentence> <Sentence>It came at last, and she came to
school, a tall, slight, handsome girl of twenty-five.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had the
crystalline beauty of Ann Harding.</Sentence> <Sentence>And how eagerly she studied and
learned!</Sentence> <Sentence>She was in the principal‚Äôs room, across from my room, but she
often came to me after four, and I was glad to help her with her
arithmetic.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her starved mind drew knowledge in with the fervor of its
own desire; she would be ready to write for her certificate at the
July examinations.</Sentence> <Sentence>One day she came to my door with her books in her
arms.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs all over,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúMy brother and his wife have come to visit
and they are both sick with typhoid.</Sentence> <Sentence>I must nurse them.</Sentence> <Sentence>So good-bye
and I thank you for helping me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe I can come back‚ÄîI will not say
die yet‚ÄîI‚Äôm only twenty-five.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a steely glint in her dark blue eyes, and she held her head
high as she walked down the stairs.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She tried again, but something always happened.</Sentence> <Sentence>Someone broke an arm,
or had a baby, or nerves, or both.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But years after there came a time when she could be spared, and
through the influence of a great Canadian doctor, she got a chance to
train in the Chicago General Hospital.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was beyond the age, but the
doctor knew her worth and got her in.</Sentence> <Sentence>She made a record there among
all those younger women, and went into private nursing and was doing
well.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the home ties were strong.</Sentence> <Sentence>She loved her own, naturally,
having done so much for them.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she came back and did more.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The years have been kind to her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She is still tall, straight and
handsome, and still the burden-bearer.</Sentence> <Sentence>She is caring now for an elder
sister in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, who is under the delusion that her friends have
just phoned for her to meet them at the Royal Alexander Hotel, so
dressed for the street she waits in the hall, and cannot understand
why the front door is kept locked.</Sentence> <Sentence>Over and over, still patient and
sweet, the gallant sister explains, reasons, cajoles, improvises and
watches‚Äîa twenty-four hour shift.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then there was a gloomy Mrs. Brant who lived a few miles west of the
little town, who attended every funeral and saw sin, sickness and
death in the brightest day of sunshine.</Sentence> <Sentence>She came to see me when my
first baby was three days old, and looking at this marvel of infant
beauty, wiped away a tear and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt set your heart on raising
this little boy, he is marked for death‚Äîsee the blue vein across his
nose‚Äîhe‚Äôll never live to wear his wedding clothes.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to throw her downstairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Blue vein, indeed!</Sentence> <Sentence>But I thought of
it that snowy morning eighteen years later in <Location>Edmonton</Location>, at the
station, when the little boy, grown a tall lad now, went out with the
Princess Pats.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>And I thought of it, with another emotion, twelve years later still,
when we stood among the flowers one happy summer evening in <Location>Edmonton</Location>
and heard the throbbing words of the marriage ceremony, beginning, ‚ÄúWe
are gathered in the sight of God and man to unite this man and this
woman.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I would have written to her to tell her she was wrong, but I did not
need to tell her then.</Sentence> <Sentence>She knew.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXVIII‚ÄîSummer Holidays</Sentence>


<Sentence>In the summer of ‚Äô92, having saved part of my salary, I went to see
Aunt Ellen in Alpena, <Location>Michigan</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went by train to Sault Ste.</Sentence> <Sentence>Marie,
then by boat to Mackinac where I spent a day and a night, and by
another boat to Alpena.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had promised myself a trip when I had money, for I wanted to see
places, the <Location>Great Lakes</Location>, the locks, big ships; and I wanted to see my
Aunt Ellen, who had always been my ideal of women.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother had good
help at this time.</Sentence> <Sentence>Martha Guest, sister of Edwin Guest, had come from
<Location>Birmingham</Location>, a little cheerful English girl.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah was teaching at
Northfield School and would be at home for the holidays, so I was free
to spend mine away from home.</Sentence> <Sentence>More than all, I wanted, I think, a long
train trip.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Trains have always fascinated me, and still do.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt this love of
trains is partly due to the fact that we waited so long for a railway.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I love to hear the long whistle of a train trumpeting through the
night, and if it wakens me I am glad, but generally it works itself
pleasantly into my dreams like sweet music.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I am old, I want to
live near the tracks where I can hear the trains at night, pounding
the rails and screaming out their signals and ringing their bells.</Sentence> <Sentence>By
day I‚Äôll see them, hauling their heavy loads, with their smoke plumes
darkening and thinning, coming back over their shoulders as they sweep
across the plain.</Sentence> <Sentence>With their force and strength, and their minds set
upon the far country, they will vitalize me again, and fill me with
the joy of living.</Sentence> <Sentence>I hope I will be so near to them that they will
shake my house as they pass, and I will sit up and listen and feel
their vibrations, and be part of them.</Sentence> <Sentence>And in my mind I will go with
them as far as I can.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then one night, when I am very old and tired, I
shall not come back, and the friends will say, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it a nice way
to go?</Sentence> <Sentence>The old lady died in her sleep.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I was speaking of my trip to Alpena.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jessie McEwen went to
Merrickville, her old home in <Location>Ontario</Location>, and Jack and Bell Poole, whom
we met in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, went to the same part of the country.</Sentence> <Sentence>So we
travelled together to Sault Ste.</Sentence> <Sentence>Marie, and there we had a wonderful
half-day watching the ships go through the locks.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew then that
geography should be taught by pictures and by exchange teachers, and
that a thousand miles of travel is better than many books.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When my friends left me, I had to go alone.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not so pleasant,
but I knew it was good for me; and I wrote copious notes in a large,
black-backed note book, and tried to look mysterious and important, as
a young lady would who was sent upon a secret mission for her
country‚Äôs good.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a wonderful day at Mackinac, and bought an Indian belt at a
curio store.</Sentence> <Sentence>I saw the natural bridge in the distance, and remember
most vividly of all, that I bought a dozen bananas for fifteen cents.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Alpena, on <Location>Lake Michigan</Location>, was then a lumber town, all pink and new,
with raw lumber houses and with piles of it on vacant lots, ready for
building.</Sentence> <Sentence>My cousin, Charley, was the foreman of a lumber company.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
came home for a few days and took me to the theatre and to a band
concert.</Sentence> <Sentence>My aunt, Ellen, had run a boarding-house for men when she
went to Alpena first, and Mary and Maggie, her daughters, had helped
her.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when the girls got married and the boys were in good
positions, she built a little house for herself on 7th Street.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was
at this house I visited her.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her youngest son, Duncan, was still at
school, and on Sundays sang in the boys‚Äô choir in the Episcopalian
Church.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My aunt had changed but little.</Sentence> <Sentence>She still had a laugh in her eyes and
a brooky mellowness in her voice.</Sentence> <Sentence>Charley seemed older than his
mother, and in speaking of this, she made the only reference I ever
heard her make to the vicissitudes of her life.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúCharley took responsibility too early,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand it has left
its mark on him.</Sentence> <Sentence>That‚Äôs the worst of family troubles.</Sentence> <Sentence>You can‚Äôt keep
it all from the children, and a wound in a child‚Äôs heart is like a
wound in a young tree.</Sentence> <Sentence>It grows with the tree, not out, but in.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Aunt Ellen had many friends and they drove us around, across the sandy
country, baked and bleached with the heat and sun, but prosperous too,
and I saw saw-mills, shingle-mills and factories.</Sentence> <Sentence>My month went by
very quickly.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I came back I had a gold-headed cane for my father,
a gift from Charley which I kept under my pillow at night and dreamed
of losing, and a quilt which Aunt Ellen had made for my Mother‚Äîblue,
white and pink, in the pattern which is called, ‚ÄúThe Sidewalks of <Location>New
York</Location>.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had a week at home before school started in September, arriving when
the harvest was in full swing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother was rather worried about my attitude toward money.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been
teaching two full years and had saved nothing.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had earned over a
thousand dollars and had nothing to show for it but a few clothes and
books.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fred Vigfuson, one of our hired men, gave me his support by
saying that I had used my money wisely‚Äîmoney was made for spending.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Fred had saved all he earned the first five years he worked and then
‚Äúbacked‚Äù a friend‚Äôs note and lost it all.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now he said he had just one
rule: ‚ÄúSpend your money so fast no one can steal it from you.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù The
whole question of spending versus saving was discussed when we sat at
the long table in the kitchen at mealtime, and though Fred and I were
convinced our idea of spending had great merit, we were voted down.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nap, the old dog, getting a little bit stiff now with advancing years,
lived at my brother Will‚Äôs house all the time‚Äîbeloved playmate of the
children‚Äîbut when I came home he returned without urging and stayed
the week.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even Leonora, the Queen of the Cats, gave me a greeting,
howbeit constrained and haughty.</Sentence> <Sentence>Leonora, under the weight of years,
had lost her enthusiasm.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was a real personality who was known all
over the neighborhood because of her many descendants.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was our
first cat after the tragedy of Sylvia, and was presented to us by Mr.
William Ingram, our neighbor, when she was a little ball of fur about
the size of a teacup.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Leonora‚Äôs many kittens were welcomed by the neighbors to keep down the
tawny striped gophers which had arrived in large numbers and dug holes
in the gardens and ate the young plants.</Sentence> <Sentence>It required no planned sales
talk to place kittens at that time.</Sentence> <Sentence>They were a favor, spoken for in
advance.</Sentence> <Sentence>Eighteen for the season seemed a very good return.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the
next summer Leonora had a mere trifling six, twice, we were a little
disappointed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we did not need to be, for Leonora made up for the
shortage by having an extra six in September.</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was a long, slender cat, swift on her feet, and a deadly enemy of
gophers.</Sentence> <Sentence>She hunted for sport, not necessity, and piled up the day‚Äôs
catch, in windrows for all to see.</Sentence> <Sentence>She lived on praise and demanded it
from every member of the family.</Sentence> <Sentence>When she was five years old she left
us mysteriously and for no apparent reason.</Sentence> <Sentence>She walked out on us.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
feared a wolf or a fox had killed her‚Äîshe was in no condition to fight
when she left‚Äîand our grief was all the more acute because of this.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nap hunted up and down the banks of the creek and all over the
neighborhood.</Sentence> <Sentence>Inquiries were made in vain.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had enough cats to go on
with, of course, but we sorrowed greatly for Leonora.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were sorry we
ever criticized her fertility.</Sentence> <Sentence>She had embarrassed us with this fatal
gift for reproduction.</Sentence> <Sentence>Eighteen kittens per season is a heavy stock to
handle, even though the prairies were wide and new settlers were
coming.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were times when we wished Leonora were not so ambitious.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Indeed, there had been some loose talk of drownings.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, she had
her revenge on us now.</Sentence> <Sentence>If we loved her in life too little, we loved
her in death too well.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I labored hard on a poem during this sad time, in which mournful
mention was made of her many excellent qualities, and deep remorse for
our criticism.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think there were ten verses in all‚ÄîI remember the last two:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúWhat caused you thus to leave us, Leonora?</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Was it a green-field-far-away attraction?</Sentence>
  <Sentence>Or did our comments on your swift addition
  Drive you to subtraction?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>A row of asterisks here indicated the passing of time, and then
another verse appeared:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúAnd while we sorrowed sore for lost Leonora
  One day she hurriedly came in the door,
  And following her came little cats galora,
  Running and leaping on the kitchen floor.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>So the story ended happily and Leonora lived out her days, her bright
coat fading as the years rolled on and her sunny disposition growing
sour and crabbed with the infirmities of age.</Sentence> <Sentence>But her good works and
labors of love were not forgotten.</Sentence> <Sentence>She reigned undisputed Queen of the
Cats, and was one of the few animals I have known to die of old age.</Sentence>
<Sentence>While I was at home I kept a record of her descendants on the smooth
side of the granary door, but after I left, this good practice was not
followed, and so a complete record can not be given.</Sentence> <Sentence>The score stood
at sixty-eight when I left, and the end was not yet!</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXIX‚ÄîIn Which the First Part of My Life Ends</Sentence>


<Sentence>Because of heavy storms, and snow-filled cut-banks, I went home at
Christmas by <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>The C.P.R. had a way of keeping their trains
moving, which the <Location>Northern Pacific</Location> had not.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our service on the
Morris-Brandon branch was called a tri-weekly service; and some
thought the spelling should be changed.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we were not disposed to be
critical of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It had come to us in our sore need and broken the
winter of our discontent.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was our own railway, and we regarded it
with great tolerance.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I arrived in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> at 4 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon of a blinding snow
storm, but a bit of rough weather, did not prevent Helen Hislop from
being at the station to meet me, for I was going to spend the night
with her.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Hislop home was always open.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I attended Normal two
years before I was often there, and enjoyed its high hospitality.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Another place could always be set at the long table, and the
conversation was easy to enter.</Sentence> <Sentence>The father was an alderman of the
city.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack was in Medical College.</Sentence> <Sentence>Helen had been teaching at Plympton
near <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, and the others were at school.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night Helen had arranged a party and I remember meeting Edgar
Burgess, who afterwards was principal of the Manitou School.</Sentence> <Sentence>I do not
remember that we danced, and I know there were no cards.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think we
only talked.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Hislop rarely spoke (I know now‚Äîthere were no open
spaces in the conversation), but often shook his head, as he looked at
us with his kindly smile.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hislop was a leader in the good works of the city, a woman of
fine ability, and a heart as big as humanity‚Äôs needs.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was
president of the Women‚Äôs Foreign Missionary Society in Saint Andrew‚Äôs
Church and was referred to as the ‚ÄúForeign Woman‚Äù by her children.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
laugh had in it a contagious merriment that made every one join her.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She had a driving ambition which inspired her children and her
friends, and I have always been grateful to her for the high value she
set on learning.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was always busy; doing for other people as well
as for her own, but she found time to read many books and could
summarize a book with great deftness and skill.</Sentence> <Sentence>She wrote a little
book, later, called _Streets of <Location>Winnipeg</Location>_, which can be found in the
<Location>Western Libraries</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At ten o‚Äôclock Mr. Hislop, true to his Scottish tradition, took the
‚ÄúBook‚Äù, and read a psalm, and we all went on our knees while he
commended his family and friends, his country and her destiny to the
mercy of ‚ÄúHim that sitteth above the clouds,‚Äù and having done this,
went to bed, leaving us to go on with our talk.</Sentence> <Sentence>But Mrs. Hislop, who
was as young as any of us, stayed on until the last guest had
departed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That night Helen and I talked, until the dawn was showing blue, behind
the window blind.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did not know when we would see each other again,
and there were many things to be said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next morning I left on the Souris branch of the C.P.R. for
Treesbank.</Sentence> <Sentence>This line has been extended from <Location>Glenboro</Location> to Souris and by
coming to Treesbank I was within four miles of home.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The pale cold light of a stormy wintry morning lay on the countryside,
cattle were huddled close together in the shade of the straw stacks,
and the smoke from the houses twisted by the scouring wind soon lost
itself in the colorless confusion of the snowy air.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could see
muffled figures moving about the barnyards attending to the stock.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew the hens would be kept in until noon, when the sun would have
more power, and even then it would be only the strong-minded hens that
would come out, and they would be quite offensive about it and
scornful of the timid ones with their tongues.</Sentence> <Sentence>If you wish to hear the
swift jagged tearing of reputations, listen to a flock of hens, and
yet they are always quite impersonal, and disinterested.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äî‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing
to me, but facts are facts.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I loved the winter scene, even when the wind whipped the loose snow
into billows, which rising and falling obscured the landscape.</Sentence> <Sentence>Plenty
of snow meant moisture for the soil, and the deadly frost killed
noisome insects and made possible No.</Sentence> 1 <Sentence>Hard wheat, which was our
fortune.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a kindness in the cold.</Sentence> <Sentence>It made food taste better,
fires burn more brightly, and brought people into closer family
circles.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew what the psalmist meant when he spoke of the virtuous
woman ‚Äúwho was not afraid of the snow for her household.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She knew it
drove her family into the circle of lamplight and made it easier to
get the children to do their homework, and strengthened the bonds of
affection.</Sentence>

<Sentence>This was my first time to travel over the long bridge flung from bank
to bank of the Souris, high above where once the little village of
<Location>Millford</Location> stood.</Sentence> <Sentence>I looked down at the deserted village below us, as we
moved carefully over the long bridge, where once many people had
lived.</Sentence> <Sentence>The buildings had long since been moved to <Location>Glenboro</Location>, and only
cellars, old walls and piles of tin cans were left.</Sentence> <Sentence>Major Roger‚Äôs
dream had come to this!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Treesbank, a mile or so from the north bank of the Souris, was the new
station, and there I found not Jack waiting for me, as I expected, but
Fred Vigfuson, the man who believed in spending his money as he made
it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fred was of Icelandic origin, and was somewhat of a rover.</Sentence> <Sentence>I asked
Fred about his trip this year, and found he was going to <Location>California</Location>.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Fred had seen more of the world than any of us, for each winter he
went somewhere, returning in the spring, quite willing to work another
summer.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even when Fred told me my father had a bad cold, I was not alarmed,
though it was seldom that he was ailing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jack had gone with Hannah to
Northfield school, for it was her closing concert, and there ‚Äúwere
great doings,‚Äù with a Christmas tree as high as the ceiling and a flag
drill.</Sentence> <Sentence>I gathered from Fred‚Äôs conversation that he would have been
there himself, but for my untimely arrival.</Sentence> <Sentence>I might as well have
stayed a day in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we reached home, the house seemed empty, and silent.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no
one in the kitchen or living-room.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother came out of the bedroom and
motioned to me to be quiet.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHe‚Äôs asleep,‚Äù she said in a whisper.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe tried to stay awake to see
you, but he dropped off.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs just a cold I hope.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù She looked anxious.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We went down to the kitchen and sat beside the cook stove.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fear had us
in its grip.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious, do you?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù I asked her.</Sentence> <Sentence>My mother knew as
much as any doctor.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAnything is serious, at his age,‚Äù she said sadly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe was eighty on
the 12th of December.</Sentence> <Sentence>Borrowed time, Nellie.</Sentence> <Sentence>Three score years and
ten.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had intended to write to him, for his eightieth birthday.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I had
forgotten, and I knew how pleased he would have been.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had only
remembered!</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe had a roast turkey,‚Äù she was saying, ‚Äúand Addie and Fred came.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Addie was eight the next day.</Sentence> <Sentence>So we had eight candles on the cake for
her.</Sentence> <Sentence>He told her he was ten times her age, but would never be that
again; and he was in a great good humour.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>But there‚Äôs a change
in him now, Nellie!</Sentence> <Sentence>And he does not even ask about the weather!</Sentence> <Sentence>You
remember his first question was always, ‚ÄòWhat is the day like?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äô But
not now.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not since he took the chill a week ago.</Sentence> <Sentence>He came in from the
barn with his teeth chattering, though it was a fine day.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got him
into bed and put the hot water bottle at his feet, and hot stove
lids.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>The day after Christmas, our local doctor suggested a consultation and
Jack drove to Brandon for a well-known doctor, who came, warmed his
hands, went in, took a look at his patient, and said in his blunt
Scotch way.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôre a pretty old man, Mr. Mooney, and have lived your life.</Sentence> <Sentence>You
can‚Äôt expect to live much longer.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father roused himself at that, and sat up.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll live out my time, Doctor,‚Äù he said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI am not going to die until
I have to; even if you think I should.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The doctor, shaking his head, proceeded to examine him.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúA general
break-up of the system‚Äù he said brutally.</Sentence> . . . ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs a case of the
one-horse shay .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>I don‚Äôt know why Anderson wanted a
consultation.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Not a kind word, not a friendly observation.</Sentence> <Sentence>The old doctor could not
soften his manner, even though his patient was dying.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was Jack who spoke his mind when he knew what had happened.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou
were brought here to do something,‚Äù Jack said to him, ‚Äúand you have
only discouraged him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúMy dear boy,‚Äù the doctor said petulantly, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work miracles, I
can‚Äôt save your Father.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe do not expect you to work a miracle,‚Äù Jack said, ‚Äúbut we do expect
you to speak civilly, even kindly to him.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in soft soaping,‚Äù the old doctor said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYour father
probably want to know the truth.</Sentence> <Sentence>He will want to put his house in
order in the few days that are left.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúHis house has been in order for many years,‚Äù Mother replied.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúHe made
his peace with God many years ago, and he has not an enemy in the
world.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>We knew he was a very sick man.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our own doctor told us
that.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we thought you might be able to do something to prolong his
days.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>After the doctor had had his dinner, Fred drove him back to Brandon.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Father made light of the doctor‚Äôs verdict.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúThat ould trap,‚Äù he said,
lapsing into his richest Irish brogue, ‚Äúwould rather tell a man he was
dying than anything else.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I‚Äôd like to make a liar out of him,
and I believe if I could get past March, I‚Äôd go another year.</Sentence> . . .
<Sentence>Anyway don‚Äôt let it trouble you.</Sentence> <Sentence>He‚Äôs right in saying, I‚Äôve had a long
life, and a pleasant one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve lived near the soil and feel friendly
to it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It will lie lightly on my bones.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day, Mr. Howarth, the Methodist minister from <Location>Stockton</Location>, came
through a heavy snow-storm and stayed all afternoon.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a cheerful
little man with a hearty laugh and it was glorious to hear Father
joining him.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were almost hopeful that day.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Before the minister left Father asked Mother and all of us to come in,
and Mr. Howarth read the 4th chapter of John, ‚ÄúLet not your hearts be
troubled,‚Äù and we drank the wine and ate the bread of the Sacrament,
and after that a great peace seemed to fall on the house.</Sentence> <Sentence>The last
words I heard my Father utter were the words of a hymn:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúThe gospel bears my spirit up,
  A faithful and unchanging God
  Lays the foundation of my hope
  In oaths, and promises and blood.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jack was the most hopeful of all of us; he could not believe the end
was near.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At noon on Tuesday mother sent for Lizzie and Will and we all stood
beside his bed.</Sentence> <Sentence>As we waited in silence we could see his breath was
growing shorter and more labored.</Sentence> <Sentence>Outside the window Nap began to
howl.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother nodded to me and I went out and brought him into the room
where he stood as silent and motionless as a dog of stone.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the great silence fell, and Will had closed, his eyes and Mother
had gone out of the room to stop the clock, Nap walked over to the
bedside with his fur bristled and looked long and wistfully at the
still face on the pillow.</Sentence> <Sentence>None of us spoke of it then but we all felt
that it was right that one dumb beast should stand among the mourners.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On January the fifth, we laid him away on the hillside in the Millford
cemetery, and came back to an empty house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And so closed the first chapter of my life.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXX‚ÄîLife Goes On, No Matter Who Dies</Sentence>


<Sentence>I did not go back to Manitou, until the first of February.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah had
to go for she was going to the Collegiate in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> for her First
Class Certificate, and she had only six months to do the year‚Äôs work.</Sentence>
<Sentence>So the four of us tried to be company for each other; Mother, Jack,
Martha Guest and myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>Fred Vigfuson had gone on his annual trip.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mother and I were getting black dresses made by the Misses Rae in
<Location>Wawanesa</Location>, two Paisley women, who had a little shop above a harness
shop.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt think I ever saw the elder Miss Rae without a few pins
in her mouth, but she was a genius at designing dresses.</Sentence> <Sentence>My best dress
was of cashmere, and had a pintucked front, with a flaring collar.</Sentence> <Sentence>A
rough serge dress, also black of course, had a double breasted basque
with large lapels, and smoked pearl buttons.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had a dozen black-edged
handkerchiefs, and black-edged notepaper.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mother wore a long crepe
veil, draped over her bonnet, and seemed very old to me, though she
was only sixty.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Women may not live any longer than they did then, but their expectancy
of life has changed.</Sentence> <Sentence>As long as I can remember my mother she was
looking forward to her death; and had her shroud made according to the
custom of her country.</Sentence> <Sentence>Many a Christmas day my young heart was
saddened by her proclamation that she might not be with us next year.</Sentence>
<Sentence>By her own attitude she made us feel she was on the brink of the grave
all her life.</Sentence> <Sentence>After my father left us, she said she was sure she would
not be long behind him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I believe Jack missed him more than any of us.</Sentence> <Sentence>Father had been his
companion all these years, the partner in all his farming operations.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Whatever happened outside had to be told to him; how were the pigs
thriving?</Sentence> <Sentence>Was the oat straw holding out?</Sentence> <Sentence>Better not let the milking
cows drink the ice-cold water, it was not good for them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Now, when the work was over, Jack seemed lost and restless.</Sentence> <Sentence>Having no
man, left him all the chores to do and that helped to fill his time.</Sentence>
<Sentence>We must not go out anywhere, for three months at least, except to
church.</Sentence> <Sentence>Certainly not to the rink, or to a party.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>or anywhere
that might give us pleasure.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and I believe I am honest in saying
we did not want to go.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had plenty to do, and that month we read
Scott‚Äôs _Talisman_ in the evenings.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I liked to go out to the stables and do the milking in the evening.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
was a peaceful scene; the cows looked contented and warm in their
stalls; and it was nice to see the cats sitting on their backs, when
we made the last trip before going to bed to see that everything was
all right.</Sentence> <Sentence>The light of the lantern caught their green eyes that shone
like pairs of emeralds down the length of the barn.</Sentence> <Sentence>The cats had their
own milk pan and were fed twice a day, and when we gave them their
portion, the pan was quickly ringed about with mounds of gray and
black fur.</Sentence> <Sentence>These were the barn cats and did not come into the house at
all, but having regular food, were law-abiding and gentle, and never
molested the chickens.</Sentence> <Sentence>We considered they were a real asset in keeping
away rats, weasels and mink.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I left for Manitou at the end of January, sorry to leave, but I wanted
to go to the Collegiate the next year, and I must earn the money; and
I really loved my work in the Manitou School.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every day was a delight,
and the Principal, who was preparing a class for the July
examinations, allowed me to come in at four and take the mathematics,
and so I got a grounding in algebra, trigonometry and geometry then,
which made it possible for me the next year at <Location>Winnipeg</Location> to win one of
the Isbister Scholarships.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Principal was a born teacher, with a genius for making difficult
lessons plain.</Sentence> <Sentence>And he led us through the intricacies of progressions
and permutations, making it appear as simple as long division.</Sentence> <Sentence>One of
his sayings was that there was no step in mathematics more difficult
than Square Root.</Sentence> <Sentence>I shall always remember him with gratitude and deep
affection dyed with heavy regret that, in his dark hours, though he
had helped many, none of us were able to help him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He had acquired early in life a taste for liquor.</Sentence> <Sentence>But had gone through
University and had made a brilliant record.</Sentence> <Sentence>He became Principal of the
High School in his home town, where every one knew of his failing and
tried to help him.</Sentence> <Sentence>But at last, even his friends had to admit failure.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He lost two other positions before he came west.</Sentence> <Sentence>For one year after he
came to Manitou he had not tasted liquor, and was confident of
success.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then he became engaged to a young teacher out in the country.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She rode into town on Friday nights, a gallant little figure on her
black horse, with a red quill in her hat.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day he told us he was going to be married at Thanksgiving.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was
very happy over the prospect of having a home and had rented and
furnished a little house not far from the school.</Sentence> <Sentence>Before the time set
for the wedding the crash came.</Sentence> <Sentence>Monday morning he came to school quite
befuddled, and with a black eye.</Sentence> <Sentence>Our great concern then was to get him
out of sight before the Trustees saw him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The bigger boys and girls knew, of course, but they were loyal, and
that outbreak passed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never saw anyone struggle harder against an
appetite, and, when it became generally known that he was putting up a
fight, everyone in that little town tried to help him, including the
hotel proprietor and the bartender, Allie Bird.</Sentence> <Sentence>The little girl was
loyal, and they were married against the advice of her friends.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
action was a vital theme of discussion.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some thought she might
succeed; they were the younger and more romantic ones.</Sentence> <Sentence>The older ones
said no woman could reform a man by marrying him.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At midsummer they left, and went to the Coast to make another start.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Again we watched the train toiling up the grade with the two of them
waving to us from the rear platform.</Sentence> <Sentence>I often thought of her and
wondered what I would have done.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wish I could give the story a happy ending.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it ended in tragedy.</Sentence>
<Sentence>After some years of uncertainty, hopes, fears and disappointments, the
end came.</Sentence> <Sentence>And so in the loss of this brilliant man, who was
everybody‚Äôs friend but his own, with all his gifts of mind and heart,
remembering what he might have been, I have another unsettled account
with the liquor traffic.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It is strange to look on these days when men were divided into two
classes; they either drank, or they didn‚Äôt drink.</Sentence> <Sentence>No woman drank,
needless to say.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No doubt our severe climate and the pioneer conditions helped to draw
this clear line.</Sentence> <Sentence>Man was pitted against the forces of nature every
day, and could not afford to be off his guard for one moment.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had
no bridges to give safe passage over streams; no road signs, no
protecting railings.</Sentence> <Sentence>In summer the work had to be done, and done on
time; every day was precious; there was no place for loiterers!</Sentence> <Sentence>And in
winter with storms and low temperatures, long journeys and dark nights
every faculty was needed; clear eye, strong arm, good judgment,
courage, which is quite different from fool-hardiness.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>As cold and hard a country as ours has one unalterable law‚Äîthe
survival of the fittest.</Sentence> <Sentence>The incompetent were like little candles in
the wind.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we knew that a man drank to excess, we regarded him with a
curious, melancholy interest, knowing that, like the men seen in the
Vision of Merza, sooner or later he would drop from sight.</Sentence>

<Sentence>So our attitude had to be one of unyielding opposition, the only
alternative being the easy-going, shallow tolerance of the
unconcerned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Betts, one of the partners of Huston and Betts, announced one
Sunday morning in church that if all the young people would come to
the vestry of the church the next evening at seven he would organize
an Epworth League.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said that there had been some objections to a
young people‚Äôs society in older places, but he believed the objections
were trivial and unworthy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we got home, we asked Mr. McClung what the objections were, and
found that some of the older people believed there was no spiritual
value in any meeting of the young people alone, the lambs should be
kept with the sheep‚Äîbecause a young people‚Äôs meeting would naturally
be a place where matches were made; in the vulgar speech of that
day‚Äî‚Äúsparking schools.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù He dismissed the objections by saying it was a
very good place for young people to meet and learn to know each other;
and so, with his approval, we were launched as an Epworth League.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Presbyterians had a Christian Endeavor, which met the same night, and
we honored John Wesley in the name of ours; and incidentally we
learned much of the history of the Founder of Methodism.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The time came for me to lead the meeting, and the subject was spring,
with the psalm about the voice of the singing bird being heard in the
land for the scripture reading.</Sentence> <Sentence>I made adequate preparation, and I was
determined to speak without notes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had had experience in public
speaking; yes, indeed, two debates at Normal, and success in both!</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was going to be funny, too; I would give the members a treat.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
no intention of reading from a trembling paper, as some of the others
had done.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wrote a paraphrase on the psalm.</Sentence> <Sentence>A little humor was what
was needed in the Epworth League.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But something happened when I began to speak.</Sentence> <Sentence>The faces in front of me
blurred, melted and rolled away, leaving me alone in a trackless sea.</Sentence>
<Sentence>My throat went dry, and my tongue thickened, and the loud silence
thundered in my ears.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I don‚Äôt know how long I stood.</Sentence> <Sentence>When I came out of it and found I could
speak once more, I told them I had prepared a speech on the Coming of
Spring, but somehow it seemed to have gotten away from me, and Spring
would have to come on just as it had always done, unaided and unsung,
so far as I was concerned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No one had ever done so poorly, and I was cast down and dismayed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr.
Betts was very encouraging and told me about Disraeli and others who
had failed in their first efforts.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I knew I was through, I could
never try again, indeed, I did not see how I could ever come to a
meeting again.</Sentence>

<Sentence>But after I went to bed that night, I tried to decide what had
happened to me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think I asked the Lord quite pointedly why he had
let me down.</Sentence> <Sentence>If I had not prepared I would have known what had caused
my downfall.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I had worked on my speech.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I remembered mother
saying it would be a good thing for me to fail in my
examination.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>it would take some of the conceit out of me.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
had things too easy, she said, and it was good for everyone to feel
the winds of the world in his face.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I found no peace until I determined to try it again.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew that when
one is thrown from a horse, the only thing to do is to climb on again.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The longer you wait the harder it is.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would ask Mr. Betts to let me
try the next Monday night.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I prepared all over again, in a more chastened and humble mood.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
began to think of my audience, instead of myself.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Coming of Spring
should mean something to them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of the fields ready for the
crops, like our minds eager for impressions.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was humbled to the
dust, emptied of ‚Äúself‚Äù in the words of the hymn, in true learner‚Äôs
mood, I no longer worried over the sort of appearance I had made.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew it did not matter.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When Monday night came, I confessed what had happened.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then I told
them I had failed because I had nothing to say that was worth saying;
I had thought of the subject, superficially, and missed the meaning of
it.</Sentence> <Sentence>My talk may have been disjointed and crude, no doubt it was, but
it was sincere, and before I was done, my audience began to ask
questions.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Betts asked me to go on with the topic the next night.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I knew I had kindled a fire, for I felt it in my own heart.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then I got my first lesson in public speaking, which is to have
something to say which you think should be said and never mind how you
say it, or what sort of a figure you are making, say it!</Sentence> <Sentence>Get it over
to your audience as clearly as you can.</Sentence> <Sentence>If you can use beautiful
words, crisp singing words, words that are sweet in your own mouth,
because of their association, so much the better, but words are only
the paper and string in which the thought is wrapped.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The high peak of social life in Manitou came at the time of the
lacrosse games, particularly when our boys played with Morden.</Sentence> <Sentence>Morden
was a larger town than Manitou, twenty miles east, and all the rivalry
that can be felt between two neighboring towns, swept over our hearts
when we even thought of Morden.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first game of the season was played on the 24th of May, and if the
day were warm and fine, the summer dresses and hats came out and made
the grandstand‚Äòs seats of bare boards blossom like a garden.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
unfortunately the Good Queen‚Äôs birthday was often a sour and sullen
day, with lowering clouds of heavy hue, and mean winds that curled up
icily through the slatted floor of the grandstand.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The 24th in 1892 was a mean and disappointing day when new dresses had
to be left lying on the spare-room beds.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not all either, for the
Graham girls had come within the year from <Location>Ontario</Location>, where the Spring
comes earlier and the 24th is considered a real summer day.</Sentence> <Sentence>So Minnie
and Mary, blue with cold, but upborne by that fortitude that new and
pretty clothes can give, came forth in pink and yellow dotted muslin
with parasols to match.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No weather could keep the game from being played, short of a snow
storm, and the 24th did not often fall that low.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the game went on;
the grandstand, full of Manitou and Morden supporters rocked with
emotion, and slander and railings.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mothers and wives and admirers sat and cheered, encouraged and advised
the players.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Bradley, whose son Tom was one of Manitou‚Äôs fleetest
runners, happened to be sitting directly behind one of Morden‚Äôs
lawyers, an elderly gentleman, who had been a lacrosse player in his
youth, in <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>When Tom began one of his lightning races down the
field carrying his stick and the ball in it, high above his head,
twisting, dodging, leaping, foiling all Morden‚Äôs attempts to trip,
waylay or throw him, his mother was naturally excited, and leaned over
her seat to direct Tom‚Äôs progress.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. Bradley, being an English
woman, carried her umbrella at all times and never had better use of
it than in that tense moment, for she grasped it in both hands and
beat with it upon the broad shoulders of Mr. Craik, until her friends
on each side forcibly restrained her.</Sentence> <Sentence>For after all, though he was
from Morden, he really had not said a word.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The young ladies who came with the team from Morden matched wits with
us in describing the shots and failures.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One thing sweetened the performance and kept a measure of good humor
in the day.</Sentence> <Sentence>Meals were served usually by the Church Ladies in the
Exhibition Building, if the weather permitted, and here mingled
victors and vanquished, home and foreign contestants and supporters in
the common fellowship of a good meal.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt‚Äôs a fine pie, anyway,‚Äù said big Dave Duncan, with a section of pie
neatly balanced on his fork.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúBoy, if the Manitou lads could play
lacrosse as well as the Manitou women can cook, we‚Äôd never get a look
in.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo one would think to look at you now, that you would hit an innocent
lad with your stick, and him doing no more than taking the ball from
you,‚Äù said Mrs. Brennagh, whose son Sam was carrying a black eye from
the game.</Sentence> <Sentence>Big Dave was full of remorse.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSay, I‚Äôm sorry, Mrs. Brennagh.</Sentence> <Sentence>That boy of yours doesn‚Äôt look where
he is going, he just runs into things, not blind exactly, but just
doesn‚Äôt care.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I‚Äôm sorry he ran against my stick.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>The great day came, when Manitou lacrosse team went to <Location>Winnipeg</Location> to
play the ‚ÄúCapitols‚Äù for the Championship of <Location>Western Canada</Location>, and the
C.P.R. put on an excursion train, which left Manitou at eight in the
morning and returned that evening, and the little town arose, packed
up two meals, took the baby and grandma, and went to see their boys
play.</Sentence> <Sentence>And they saw their boys win the game in a fair fight; and the
silver cup presented to Charley Gordon, the captain.</Sentence> <Sentence>The local
photographer had taken their picture before they left, knowing that
history was being made.</Sentence>

                  *       *       *       *       *

<Sentence>In 1893, I went to the Collegiate Institute, in <Location>Winnipeg</Location>, where Mr. F.
H. Schofield was the principal.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hannah had been successful the year
before, and received in the July examinations the highest marks that
had been taken in the Province.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew I could not hope to equal her
achievement.</Sentence> <Sentence>I would be well satisfied if I could get through.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I went to <Location>Winnipeg</Location> about December the first and roomed with Hannah,
who had received an appointment on the city staff.</Sentence> <Sentence>She lived at a
stately home on <Location>Ross Street</Location>, where our landlady told us quite often
that she kept boarders for company only, and really did not need the
money.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe have a business in the city,‚Äù she said, in the fine old English
tradition, and when I found out quite by accident, that it was a
livery business, I wondered why she did not say so.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Her parlor was high-ceilinged and cold, with a marble-topped mantle,
above the unused fireplace, and was only used by us, when we had
callers, by Hannah rather, for she had a theological admirer now, who
came once a week.</Sentence> <Sentence>By special concession the parlor door might be left
open after dinner, so that some of the heat from the coal-stove in the
hall could penetrate its chilling depths.</Sentence> <Sentence>The young man wore his
fur-lined coat and Hannah put on her fur coat when she heard the bell
ring.</Sentence> <Sentence>However, the call lasted until ten o‚Äôclock, and the cold room
was not even commented on.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were a hardy race.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Hannah went home at the end of 1893, and took the Northfield School;
and I left the lady on Ross street too, and found a much happier place
at 464 Jemima St., the home of Dr. and Mrs. W. A. Dunbar and their
daughter Jessie.</Sentence> <Sentence>My friend Jessie McEwen, who had taught with me in
Manitou, came with me, she too was going to take her ‚Äúfirst‚Äù, at the
Collegiate, and we spent six months together very happily.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Jessie Dunbar sang in St. Andrew‚Äôs choir, and was the centre of a
jolly crowd of young people, who were often entertained by her; and we
were welcomed by them.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we had to do a year‚Äôs work in the six
months, so we spent our evenings delving into the prescribed
text-books, upstairs in our little room, where Jessie used the
washstand, and I the bureau, there being no room for a table.</Sentence> <Sentence>But we
were comfortable, well-fed, and contented, and we were getting on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At the Collegiate it was easy to see who among the students were
spending his or her own money, and who were still supported by
parents.</Sentence> <Sentence>The latter came late, unprepared, talked of parties and
dances, and regarded the daily grind of the High School as a tiresome
interruption of their good times.</Sentence> <Sentence>We who had been teaching, and had
earned our own money, were in deadly earnest, and did everything we
were expected to do, listened to the lectures, and never missed a
class.</Sentence> <Sentence>No doubt the young ones resented our industry.</Sentence> <Sentence>I know I envied
them, and would have been glad to be going to the parties, and wearing
pretty clothes too.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it could not be, so I stifled all such vain
imaginings in the pasteurized pages of ‚ÄúGreen‚Äôs Short History of the
English People.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Schofield had perfect control of the Collegiate.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did what we
were told without question.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every inch of that forbidding brick
structure on <Location>Kate Street</Location>, was sacred to him, and because of him, to
us.</Sentence> <Sentence>We walked the halls soberly, and we walked in the middle of the
halls, no one ran up or down stairs; the desks had their shining
surfaces, undefaced.</Sentence>

<Sentence>And how we worked!</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the examinations came, I weighed ninety-five pounds.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when I
sat down to write, I had a feeling that I knew the course, and with
any sort of fair papers I should be pretty sure of passing.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When I went home after the examinations, I slept the clock around for
the first two weeks.</Sentence> <Sentence>On August the first, we got the news.</Sentence> <Sentence>Jessie and
I had both passed.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Schofield wrote me, and Mr. E. R. Garrett, the
history and chemistry teacher, and the whole world seemed to me to be
a joyful place.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had gone to <Location>Wawanesa</Location> that morning for the mail, expecting the
returns and there they were on the third page of the _Manitoba Free
Press_.</Sentence> <Sentence>Miss Shields in the Post Office told me, before I opened the
paper.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A few days after I had a letter from the Treherne School Board
offering me a position, and I accepted it, without delay.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. McClung
had been moved to Treherne by the Stationing Committee, so I would
still be with the family I liked so well.</Sentence> <Sentence>And though the eldest son
was still in Manitou he would come sometimes to see us.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXXI‚ÄîTreherne</Sentence>


<Sentence>Treherne was then a village of perhaps six hundred people, and had
three teachers, in the dark green wooden building, at the southwestern
end of the settlement.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had the middle room, grades 6, 7, and 8, and
sang in the choir, and joined the W.C.T.U. and helped with the Mission
Band each Monday evening at seven o‚Äôclock.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The social life of the little town centred around the church, whose
doors were open, and windows alight each night except Saturday, when
everyone was supposed to repair early to bed, after blackening boots
and indulging in the weekly bath, or as the English people said,
‚Äústrip-wash‚Äù, with a mind sobered and calmed and ready to receive the
message at the morning service.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>McClung was an advocate of the early closing of the stores, and
preached about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed he preached about anything that concerned
the welfare of his people.</Sentence> <Sentence>He refused to take refuge behind Amos or
Elijah, or any ancient authority.</Sentence> <Sentence>The divisions among the Children of
<Location>Israel</Location> were used by him as a point of departure for his sermons, but
he quickly arrived at the vagaries and wanderings of the people of
<Location>Treherne</Location> and <Location>Manitoba</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>He denounced governments, bombarded the liquor
traffic, but never failed to preach a wide gospel of redeeming love.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was a small man, in stature, with a fine head of brown curly hair,
bushy brows, fine forehead, and large lustrous eyes of steel blue.</Sentence> <Sentence>He
was fortunate in having a musical speaking voice, and was independent
of choirs and organists, for he could lead the singing like an
orchestra.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The family were often worried over his pulpit utterances, and I was
too, and wished he would use the soft pedal, once in a while.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when
we tried to advise him he knew our voices for the voice of the Tempter
trying to turn his aside from the plain, though thorny path of duty,
and kept to his high resolves.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was a man of untiring energy and had a keen memory for faces and
names; and was undaunted by circumstances.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was possessed of a
shrewd worldly wisdom which contributed largely to his success as a
minister.</Sentence> <Sentence>When one of the leading men in Treherne became deeply
offended over his blunt and uncompromising denunciation of the
government, he went at once to see him, and came back with some of the
man‚Äôs books, and said they had had a wonderful argument.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he found
a farmer beating his horses on a slippery hill, because the poor
brutes could not hold their feet, he drew off to one side of the road,
got out and denounced the driver for his ‚Äúdevilish‚Äù temper.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then
unhitched ‚ÄúGeorge,‚Äù his own horse, and brought him over and hooked him
to the tongue of the sleigh and helped the team to get to the top of
the hill.</Sentence> <Sentence>But the incident did not end there, for he went to see the
man the next day, brought him under conviction of sin, signed him up
for the ‚Äúkingdom‚Äù, and a few Sundays afterwards received him and his
family into the Church.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He was as hungry a reader as I ever have known.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every printed page
attracted him, and I know it was only his fervid desire to save souls
that drove him away from his reading.</Sentence> <Sentence>He cut columns from newspapers,
made annotations on the books he read, and spent every cent he could
spare, and more, on books and periodicals.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we were in Treherne I got a copy of Trilby, Du Maurier‚Äôs much
talked of book, and read it with a distinct sense of adventure.</Sentence> <Sentence>Here
was a very daring book surely, fascinating but perilous!</Sentence> <Sentence>Before I had
finished Mr. McClung sounded the alarm and spoke very seriously to me.</Sentence>
<Sentence>An evil book could poison the mind like nothing else, and he believed
I should not finish it.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would have been more disturbed if he had
known who sent it to me, but I carefully suppressed that information.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He asked me to forego the book as an exercise of will power.</Sentence> <Sentence>Character
was built by self-denial, and character was the object of all our
teaching.</Sentence> <Sentence>Under the influence of his eloquent appeal, I agreed that I
would not read the book for a week.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The more I thought of the story, the more I desired to know the end.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
simply could not leave Trilby at loose ends.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I left the book on
a little table in the hall and waited.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>That day when Mrs. McClung called him to come down for dinner he did
not hear her and she had to go up and get him, and then I knew my plan
was working.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>He had to go out for the afternoon and I let him
have another bout with the book before he went.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wanted him to be
approaching the great scene in the theatre before I took it away.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day I went into his study and got the book.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mrs. McClung and
Nell were both in the plot, and we enjoyed seeing him hunting for it.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He couldn‚Äôt very well ask any of us, and besides we had all gone very
high-minded and detached from earthly joys.</Sentence> <Sentence>We talked of
self-sacrifice and self-denial, and the joys of renouncement.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI think you should read that book yourself,‚Äù I said to him at last.</Sentence>
‚<Sentence>ÄúSo you could see for yourself how subtle it is, and fascinating.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Indeed I think it might be well to preach a sermon on it.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>He looked at me with darkening suspicion.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt take you long to read it‚Äînow,‚Äù I said.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYoung woman,‚Äù he said, looking at me with his brows drawn down,
‚Äúyou‚Äôve got me and you know it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I believe you left it there to tempt
me.</Sentence> <Sentence>It‚Äôs the most diabolically interesting book I ever read, and I‚Äôm
not so sure that it is an evil book either.</Sentence> <Sentence>Where is it?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I produced the book, and a great silence settled down on the little
study while the Chairman of the <Location>Treherne District</Location> of the Methodist
Church followed the fortunes of poor Trilby.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The publication of W. T. Stead‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúTwo and Two makes Four,‚Äù in
1891 dropped a stone into the peaceful waters of religious thought,
whose widening waves reached as far as Treherne where we read the book
with creepy fascination.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>McClung took a firm stand against it, not that he doubted the
sincerity of the great Editor, but he believed that it was not God‚Äôs
will that there should be communication between those who had passed
over and those who were left.</Sentence> <Sentence>John Wesley‚Äôs house had been visited by
spirits who rang bells, pounded on doors, rattled dishes, moved
furniture, and in many ways annoyed and troubled the occupants; but
they were evil spirits sent by the kingdom of darkness to impede the
great work of salvation carried on by this man of God.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No good end could be served by trying to raise the powers of evil.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
we wanted to see for ourselves, and so when Mr. McClung was safely
away at his two other appointments, Nell, Herb, and I, and Zella
Motheral, who was the local milliner, and organist in the Church, were
not above doing a little table rapping in the interests of scientific
discovery.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On Hallowe‚Äôen night we got the perfect setting for an evening with the
spirits.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. and Mrs. McClung had gone to <Location>Bethel</Location> to a Harvest Home
Supper, and would stay the night, because of the wild weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rain
lashed the windows, and the trees were agitated by the wind, whose
sudden gusts rattled every window and door in the house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nellie and I and Zella were entertaining the Epworth League at the
Parsonage, and as the coast was clear, the activity of the evening was
table rapping‚Äîand how the table did quiver, and rise.</Sentence> <Sentence>It seemed to
come up with every heave of the storm.</Sentence>

<Sentence>A load of wheat had been stolen from a field granary nearby, and we
asked the spirits to tell us who had taken it.</Sentence> <Sentence>We named the letters of
the alphabet, and as the table rapped we wrote down the letter.</Sentence> <Sentence>To our
horror the table rapped out the name of ‚Äî‚Äî one of the young men, who
belonged to the League, but had recently returned to <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was a
College student who had spent the summer working for a farmer, and had
gone back to pursue his studies.</Sentence> <Sentence>We asked the table for the first
name, and got it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not the name we knew him by, but it
corresponded with his second initial.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were rather frightened over this, and felt we were getting into
deep water.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did not believe the charge.</Sentence> <Sentence>The young man was the
unlikeliest person in the world to steal.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had been drawing wheat to
the elevator for his employer; and he could, of course, have taken a
load from the neighbor‚Äôs granary, and it could not be detected.</Sentence> <Sentence>But he
wouldn‚Äôt do this, we felt sure, and we solemnly promised, each other
we would never tell what the table had rapped out.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was done in fun,
and we must not attach any importance to it.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe must not mistake ourselves for a court of law,‚Äù Billy Rogers said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Then we tried a little mesmerism.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tom Simpson, who was a clerk in a
dry goods store, and had some experience, would mesmerize me.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tom and
I had agreed that we put on a fine act of this kind, and I knew what I
was supposed to do.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had talked it over one day when I was in the
store.</Sentence> <Sentence>So this seemed to be the night, with every condition right‚Äîthe
wild night, with groaning trees, weird sounds at the windows, and
doors, as the storm circled the house.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom tied a silk handkerchief around his head to help him to
concentrate, and looked me steadily in the eye to give me my orders.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
stared back in silence, and suppressed my desire to laugh; the company
sat on all the available chairs, with an overflow meeting on the
floor, but I held myself rigid and calm, not moving a muscle.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
thought-waves were running, and I must receive them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the suspense began to be painful, I turned and walked to the
door, slowly, and impressively, looking straight ahead of me, like a
sleep-walker, and went upstairs, returning with a comb in my hand.</Sentence>
(<Sentence>Tom had told the company that this was what I should do.</Sentence>)

<Sentence>There was a distinct gasp of surprise when I came back, with the comb.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNow she is completely under hypnotic influence,‚Äù Tom said grandly,
‚Äúand knows no mind but mine.</Sentence> <Sentence>Murders have been committed by innocent
people when under this influence.</Sentence> <Sentence>Indeed that is a strong argument
against hypnotism in any form.</Sentence> <Sentence>The strong exploit the weak, and send
them on dastardly errands.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is a power for righteousness, if
properly used.</Sentence> <Sentence>I could impose on Miss Mooney now, a deep hypnotic
sleep which would last until I released her, a sleep in which all the
powers of nature would gain strength, and build up her physical being.</Sentence>
<Sentence>That is the beneficent side of hypnotism.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nell began to get frightened.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúTake her out, Tom,‚Äù she said anxiously,
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt bear to look at her.</Sentence> <Sentence>She looks so vacant.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I didn‚Äôt
think you could mesmerize her.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought she had a stronger mind than
yours.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>She may never come right.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôll give her two more things to do,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúthen I‚Äôll release
her.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I knew what they were and I did them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I went into the kitchen and
brought back a sandwich which I gave to Ed Roberts, and then took off
Zella‚Äôs beads and fastened them around my own neck.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúCan you make her sing,‚Äù Zella asked, trembling with excitement‚Äîshe
had read ‚ÄúTrilby‚Äù, too.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI would rather not try,‚Äù Tom said.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúIt would be too hard on her at
first.</Sentence> <Sentence>That sort of control takes practice.</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be no value in
it anyway, she would sing only in her own voice, but with practice I
could lend her mine.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúDo you mean you could make her sing something she doesn‚Äôt know?</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
Billy Rogers asked.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom explained.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúAt the moment she knows nothing except what I let her know.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúGosh!</Sentence> <Sentence>that‚Äôs tough on her, and her a teacher,‚Äù Billy laughed.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúShe‚Äôll
lose her job if that‚Äôs all she knows.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I wanted to look about me, but I couldn‚Äôt do that, so I held to the
vacant stare, and the audience were plainly impressed.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúTake her out,‚Äù they were calling.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôm scared.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúSo am I. .</Sentence> . . <Sentence>this has gone too far.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI thought it was all a joke at first.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>but I see it‚Äôs the real
thing.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom came over to me and eyed me solemnly.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then he clapped his hands
before my face.</Sentence> <Sentence>I stared on.</Sentence> <Sentence>I decided I‚Äôd give Tom a few minutes of
anxiety.</Sentence> <Sentence>I kept on staring.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Tom turned pale, and began to shake me.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were cries all around
me‚Äîsomeone ran for water‚ÄîNell was bathing my face.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some one called
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going for the doctor.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>That settled it‚ÄîDr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Lamont was one of my trustees.</Sentence> <Sentence>I came back in a
hurry, with a fine show of wakening up from a long sleep.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we sat
eating our sandwiches, and drinking coffee, I heard some interesting
things.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt look like that if you had been fooling us,‚Äù Zella said,
‚Äúso empty, and vacant, just like the people in the asylum.</Sentence> <Sentence>At first, I
thought you were just doing it for fun, but I soon saw you were really
mesmerized; and it‚Äôs awful.</Sentence> <Sentence>Tom you must promise never to do it
again.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI‚Äôm done,‚Äù Tom said solemnly.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI never had such a scare in my life.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I think our amateur performance had a good effect after all.</Sentence> <Sentence>It
convinced us of how easily people can be deceived.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We turned to something saner, and more satisfying after that, for we
began the study of the ‚ÄúTrial Scene in the Merchant of <Location>Venice</Location>,‚Äù which
we put on at the Christmas concert, and repeated it at Midsummer.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was a peculiar aftermath of our adventure in the realm of
physical research which troubled us greatly.</Sentence> <Sentence>Suspicion began to point
to the young man who had gone east, and we had a bad time over it
fearing that there had been a leakage from our party.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is so easy to
throw suspicion.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was talk of bringing the young man back from
<Location>Ontario</Location> to be tried at the Spring Assizes for theft.</Sentence> <Sentence>But in the midst
of our anxiety the case was settled anonymously.</Sentence> <Sentence>So the matter has
remained a mystery, which, so far as I know, was never cleared up.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I have a pleasant recollection of the lovely autumn days in Treherne.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The parsonage stood beside the Church, and both, facing east, looked
out across the road to the deep ravine whose wooded banks broke the
monotony of the prairie.</Sentence> <Sentence>The country around Treherne has more trees
than many parts of <Location>Manitoba</Location> and with its deep black loam, and abundant
rainfall, the farmers were prosperous and contented.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still, even
there, the call of the far country had come to some, and Mr. A. J.
Cotton left his farm that year, and went still farther west to Swan
River to get free land for his boys.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When he wrote back that he had harvested fifty-five bushels of wheat
to the acre on his new farm, we found it hard to believe.</Sentence> <Sentence>But knowing
Mr. Cotton we could not very well doubt him, and besides we did not
want to be like some of the <Location>Ontario</Location> people who doubted everything that
came out of the west, every good thing, I mean.</Sentence> <Sentence>So this story had to
be accepted.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When four o‚Äôclock came, and I got my desk tidied and the boards
cleaned, and the last item of the day‚Äôs business closed, I was glad of
the period of relaxation before supper time.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a hammock made
of barrel staves, with a rope run through auger holes on each end; and
covered with a blanket and plenty of pillows hung between two trees,
at the North-east corner of the Parsonage.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there I often lay, when
the weather was fine, looking up at the clouds.</Sentence> <Sentence>I always had a curious
sense of detachment in that hammock suspended between heaven and
earth.</Sentence> <Sentence>My past seemed to be below me, and my future above me, and my
whole mentality was quickened and kindled as I lay there.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember
how ecstatically I repeated:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúOut of the night that covers me,
    Dark as the pit from pole to pole,
  I thank whatever gods there be
    For my unconquerable soul.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Or,</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúWho would dare the choice?</Sentence>
    <Sentence>Neither or both to know?</Sentence>
  <Sentence>The highest quiver of joy
    The most exquisite pang of woe.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was often in that grand mood that my family used to refer to
derogatively, as being on my high horse, but they were quite mistaken
in their estimate of it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was really an innocent exaltation that
always left me the better for it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was the one hour of the day, when I let my mind run free, and over
and above the sounds of the little town with the clip-clop of horses
feet on the hard roads, the voices of children at play, puffs of a
gasoline engine at the elevator, there came in from the country the
rhythmic sounds of a threshing machine in a grain field near by.</Sentence> <Sentence>Ours
was a world of action and effort, a battle against time.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew the
fear that always drives the farmer, of frost, and covering snow, which
deprives the cattle of their easy grass, and the finality of the
freeze-up.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Indoors, I knew busy women were prodding big black
stoves to greater efforts; others were frantically peeling potatoes
from a wash tub on the floor, long tables were set through ‚Äúthe room,‚Äù
oilcloth covered, with thick white dishes, and a few of the good ones,
grudgingly put out for the threshers.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Often, too, as I enjoyed that hour under the trees my thoughts ran
into the future with a tingling sense of danger.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew there was no
security in life.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>no security for women anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence>They could make
such tragic mistakes.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I had seen it in my twenty years of
life.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Had I any reason to think I might escape?</Sentence> <Sentence>I was glad I had
found the McClung family.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>I loved the table conversations and the activities of a parsonage.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
knew I had a place in their affections, too, all of them.</Sentence> . . .

<Sentence>If I could only be like Mrs. McClung‚Äîsweet, placid, serene, whose life
flowed on in endless song, above earth‚Äôs lamentation, who had a gift
for goodness as others have for music.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I knew that could never be!</Sentence>
<Sentence>And I wanted to write, and how could I write unless I lived and felt,
and sorrowed‚Äîand living was dangerous.</Sentence> <Sentence>Still, I had no desire to stand
off in the side lines all my life.</Sentence> <Sentence>And besides there was Wes.</Sentence> <Sentence>I never
got far in my thinking without coming to him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He believed in me; he
said no one could tell a story as well; no one could be more
convincing; and when he became engulfed in doubts and fears, and at
enmity with the doctrines of the church, and his father‚Äôs stern
theology, and belief in eternal punishment, he had been helped by my
exposition of the plan of salvation.</Sentence> <Sentence>I believed that when we are not
asked whether or not we wanted to be born, God would not lightly
condemn us to suffer for ever, no matter what we had done.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had
welcomed the sane theology of _Robert Elsmere_ and _John Ward_,
_Preacher_.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Wes and I had walked for miles in Manitou threshing out our beliefs,
and I thought of him often as I lay watching the pageant of the sky.</Sentence>
<Sentence>He had suffered in reputation from being a minister‚Äôs son; not that he
had ever done anything very wrong, but because he loved fun and
company, and athletics, and had played cards.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had been in <Location>Toronto</Location>
at College when I was in <Location>Winnipeg</Location> at the Collegiate, and during that
time we had written each other every week high-minded letters of
theological and literary import, and I knew that a delayed letter made
me very miserable.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I would not need to lay aside my ambition if I married him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would
not want me to devote my whole life to him, he often said so.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said
I always called out the very best that was in him, and I knew I was
filled with a great sense of well-being when we were together, for he
seemed to light all the candles of my mind.</Sentence> <Sentence>We wondered if this could
be love; we were disposed to think it was, but we had a sort of
gentleman‚Äôs agreement that, if at any time either of us found out that
there was something beyond all this, we would not hesitate to intimate
to the other that such was so.</Sentence> <Sentence>And there would be no scenes, no
recriminations; and we would go on liking each other always.</Sentence>

<Sentence>On my birthday he sent me an opal ring, which I kept in the pocket of
my valise and did not wear‚Äîto save explanations.</Sentence> <Sentence>I found it always
hard to speak of the things that mattered most, and when I heard girls
tell of the proposals of marriage they had received, repeating
conversations relating thereto, I was distinctly uncomfortable.</Sentence> <Sentence>There
was a certain indecency in it, I thought, and a betrayal of confidence
at keyholes.</Sentence> <Sentence>So I said nothing at home of the young man in the drug
store.</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be plenty of time for that .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>and if either of
us found out we had made a mistake there would be no explanations to
make.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I had moments when my conscience chided me for indulging in this
period of rest.</Sentence> <Sentence>Hard-working people such as we were, were ever
suspicious of leisure, and even sat down with a feeling that had an
element of guilt in it.</Sentence> <Sentence>I often wished I could stifle that nagging
voice that seemed to tell me all waking hours should be hours of
effort.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One day my peaceful hours in the hammock were interrupted.</Sentence> <Sentence>One of the
little girls in my Junior Class came to me after four, and I knew she
had something on her mind, when she asked me if she could wait and
walk home with me.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was an appealing little thing, very tractable
and sad‚Äîfar too sad for a young thing.</Sentence> <Sentence>I knew the family history, or
part of it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When we left the school, she took my hand and said:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúTeacher, I wish you would come and see my mother‚Äînot tonight, but
some time when I tell you.</Sentence> <Sentence>She is mad nearly all the time, because
she‚Äôs so tired.</Sentence> <Sentence>There are too many of us and she‚Äôs sick again.</Sentence> <Sentence>And she
may get another baby soon.</Sentence> <Sentence>She always gets a baby before the last one
can walk, and it makes her mad.</Sentence> <Sentence>And teacher she can see you in the
hammock, and it makes her worse mad.</Sentence> <Sentence>She says some people have all the
luck.</Sentence> <Sentence>She never can get a rest, because there are too many of us.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Please teacher, maybe you wouldn‚Äôt go in the hammock no more, for a
while .</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>my mother says hard things about you, Teacher, just
because she‚Äôs all tired out.</Sentence> <Sentence>Maybe it would make you mad, if you
knew.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I assured little Evadell that I would not be a bit mad, and maybe we
could think of some way her mother could get a rest, and I would stay
out of the hammock tonight, anyway.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next day I took counsel with the other teacher, who had been
longer in the neighborhood than I, and who was always ready to help a
family in need.</Sentence> <Sentence>She knew Evadell‚Äôs family quite well.</Sentence> <Sentence>She told me the
father worked on the section, drank when he could get it, (Treherne
was under local option, but <Location>Holland</Location>, eight miles away, had two bars),
and was not any too fond of work.</Sentence> <Sentence>The mother, she said, was a
bitter-tongued Irishwoman, whom it was hard to help.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the
Forester‚Äôs Lodge had sent her a turkey for Christmas, she was too
proud to accept it and sent it back, telling them to keep their
charity for them that asked for it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She would let her children go
hungry rather than take anything from anybody, and she was never so
happy as when she was in pitched battle with her neighbors.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Miss W. ‚Äî‚Äî did not think anything could be done for them.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI tried it,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhen I came.</Sentence> <Sentence>I made a dress for Evadell, and
she wouldn‚Äôt let her wear it.</Sentence> <Sentence>She has a hard time, but she makes most
of it herself.</Sentence> <Sentence>I don‚Äôt even blame her man for drinking.</Sentence> <Sentence>She‚Äôd drive
any man to drink with her tongue.</Sentence> <Sentence>Go back to the hammock when your
day‚Äôs work is done, in peace, and forget Mrs. N. ‚Äî‚Äî.</Sentence> <Sentence>If she weren‚Äôt
mad at you it would be somebody else.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But I did not feel just right about it.</Sentence> <Sentence>The next day I went to see
Mrs. N. ‚Äî‚Äî, and I found her in high spirits.</Sentence> <Sentence>She was not the
bedraggled, discontented woman I had expected to find.</Sentence> <Sentence>Her
conversation rang along the line of past victories over her neighbors,
and the acid replies she made to the people who had tried to help her.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI know I have too many children, and there are
times when I get out of temper and wish I had never got married.</Sentence> <Sentence>I‚Äôve
often said that if it were not for just the clear disgrace of it, I
would rather be a withered-up old maid school teacher like Miss
Harris, or what you‚Äôll be yourself some day.</Sentence> . . .‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>I came away soon after that, and tried all the time I was in Treherne
to smooth the path of poor little Evadell, who had been so unfortunate
in her choice of a mother.</Sentence>

<Sentence>How inescapable are our family connections!</Sentence> <Sentence>Though we have no voice,
or hand, in saying into what family we shall be born, we find
ourselves there, bound forever, blessed or marred, helped or hampered,
by a relationship which was forced upon us.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXXII‚ÄîThe Royal Visit</Sentence>


<Sentence>Lord and Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> were in Rideau Hall at <Location>Ottawa</Location> at this time
representing the Queen in <Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> had sponsored a plan the year before for bringing
English girls to <Location>Canada</Location>, and in her thorough way had done the work of
choosing the girls herself, and selecting the homes.</Sentence> <Sentence>It happened that
the <Location>Treherne District</Location> had received several of these young visitors,
and the Governor and Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> were coming to visit their little
wards.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Great were the preparations for the official visit; everyone felt the
excitement of having royalty come to our little community.</Sentence> <Sentence>The people
who had met Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> and her two secretaries the year before were
not so panicky as we who had only our own imagination to draw on.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mrs.</Sentence> <Sentence>Rollins, at whose home Nellie James, one of the English girls,
was living, told me when I was at her place for dinner that Lady
<Location>Aberdeen</Location> was just the plainest, loveliest woman anyone could wish to
meet.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúYou‚Äôd think she had been brought up on a farm herself, she is
so understanding.</Sentence> <Sentence>She asked me for a quilt pattern I was making, mind
you, and I think would have been ever more chatty and friendly if it
hadn‚Äôt been for the two secretaries, who were along with her.</Sentence> <Sentence>They
watched her pretty close.</Sentence> <Sentence>And Nellie had told me a lot about her
Ladyship.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I would like nothing better than to have her come and
stay a week.</Sentence> <Sentence>But of course she has many places to visit.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nellie James, the white skinned, brown eyed seventeen-year-old
adventurer, who had come across the sea to make <Location>Canada</Location> her home, was a
good ambassador from the old land to the new; for Nellie had the gifts
and graces which made her a popular member of the community.</Sentence> <Sentence>She could
sing, play the piano, and recite, and she was always ready to do what
she could.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One of her popular numbers was the ‚ÄúCotter‚Äôs Saturday Night,‚Äù and as
the scene unfolded, it was easy to see Nellie as the eldest girl who
came home, ‚Äúwith love sparkling in her ee‚Äô, perhaps to show a braw new
gown, or bring her sair won penny fee, to help her parents dear, if
they in hardship be.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Nellie had other selections too, and on the first of July was ready
with:</Sentence>

  ‚<Sentence>ÄúBreathes there a man, with soul so dead
  Who never to himself hath said
  This is my own, my native land.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> had chosen a good home for Nellie, when she sent her to
Mr. and Mrs. Rollins.</Sentence> <Sentence>The nationality was the right one‚ÄîScotch from
Inverness; they were the pillars of the Presbyterian Church, and owned
the one baby-grand piano in the little town, and their big living room
was the scene of many gatherings.</Sentence> <Sentence>The night the teachers and the choir
of the church were entertained there, Nellie and Fanny Rollins, the
daughter of the house, in white aprons and caps (the caps brought by
Nellie) served us from a long table which ran through the archway,
between the dining room and living room, and Mrs. Rollins told us
proudly that the girls had done all the cooking except the turkey
dressing; and after dinner Nellie sang to Fanny‚Äôs accompaniment,
‚ÄúDrink to Me Only With Thine Eyes‚Äù, ‚ÄúBen Bolt‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCherry Ripe‚Äù.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Miss E. ‚Äî‚Äî, one of the other teachers, and an old-country woman,
whispered to me that the young Scotch girl would be spoiled by being
made so much of, and she wondered at Mrs. Rollins putting her forward
like this, when she was really only a servant after all, even if Lady
<Location>Aberdeen</Location> had placed her.</Sentence> <Sentence>But no echo of this criticism dulled the
radiance of Nellie‚Äôs triumphs.</Sentence> <Sentence>She continued in her happy way, a
cheerful little emissary.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One of the other girls whom Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> had placed was not so happy.</Sentence>
<Sentence>She had a good home too, but her face was full of gloom and
discontent; she cried often, and could not be comforted.</Sentence> <Sentence>Nellie was
sent to spend a day with her, but the source of her grief remained
undiscovered.</Sentence> <Sentence>When Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> came to see her, Jennie admitted her
mistress was kind, her room comfortable, her work was easy, everyone
was pleasant and friendly, but she could not be happy eating with an
iron fork and tin spoon, and a knife with a black handle.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúI fancy,‚Äù
she said, ‚Äúthat they always taste of onions.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> allayed her grief‚Äîshe would send her a silver knife,
fork and spoon for her birthday.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was the wish of Lord and Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> that no entertainment be
given for them, for their time was so short they wanted to spend it
visiting their wards.</Sentence> <Sentence>Their private car, standing at the siding,
became an object of interest, but we did manage to keep the school
children from gathering around it, by constant appeals to their honor.</Sentence>
<Sentence>They must not fail in any act of courtesy to these wonderful people,
Queen Victoria‚Äôs representatives, who were trying to help the people
of <Location>Canada</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>One sharp eyed sleuth from my room brought in a fairly full report on
the contents of the car, declaring she got all her information quite
honestly from the upstairs windows of the section house where her
sister lived.</Sentence> <Sentence>She said the secretaries wore grey flannel nightdresses,
and that the cook rubbed the pots with an onion, and everyone of them
had their own bed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We knew the Aberdeens would return from the western part of their trip
in about a week, and would pass through Treherne on the evening train,
which made a stop of ten minutes while the engine took water from the
tank beside the track.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Someone conceived the idea of presenting them with an illuminated
address.</Sentence> <Sentence>There would be plenty of time to read it, and it seemed to be
a fitting and courteous way of thanking them for coming.</Sentence> <Sentence>The post
master, Alan Ross, our local poet, wrote the address.</Sentence>

<Sentence>For a while there was some uncertainty in the matter of the reading of
it.</Sentence> <Sentence>A minister was the first choice, and we had four Protestant
Ministers and a Roman Catholic priest.</Sentence> <Sentence>At first the Anglican seemed to
travel next the pole on account of His Excellency‚Äôs connection with
the Established Church in <Location>England</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>But it was urged by some of the
Non-conformists that the Anglican minister would not read without
intoning and besides this was a citizen‚Äôs affair, and should have no
ecclesiastical flavor.</Sentence> <Sentence>Some one suggested the auctioneer as a highly
suitable reader, accustomed to public speaking, and this would carry
the matter away from denominational controversy.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The address set down in Alan Ross‚Äô neat writing, and tastefully framed
in golden oak, looked rather bleak and bare, and a bit austere, so
someone suggested that it be illuminated in gold and colored ink.</Sentence>
<Sentence>There was a man who lived back in the hills, who could do beautiful
work, and had <Location>India</Location> ink, and gold and silver paints.</Sentence> <Sentence>It would cost
five dollars, but what of it?</Sentence> <Sentence>We had not the privilege of addressing
the Queen‚Äôs representative every day!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The address was illuminated or rather decorated.</Sentence> <Sentence>It came back in a
scroll rolled on an oak roller, and from the faint glimpse I caught of
it, and from the auctioneer‚Äôs description afterwards, ‚Äúilluminate‚Äù was
the one word which should not be applied to it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It had birds with tape flowing from their bills, acorns and oak trees,
summer cottages and ships at sea, and for a background there were
clouds and elevators, threshing machines, and haystacks to give local
color, and the script was done in early English, in four colors.</Sentence>

<Sentence>When the train pulled in a messenger went to the private car, and
asked their Excellencies if they would come into the station, which
they did, umbrellas in hand, for the night was raining with all the
black insistence of a November downpour.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The station was full and all the bracket lamps were set in high gear,
but unfortunately were placed too high on the walls to be effective,
so some of the company carried lanterns.</Sentence> <Sentence>There had been some delay in
getting the address back from the illuminator, but it arrived just as
the train drew in, and when their Excellencies had lowered their
umbrellas, and were placed under the brightest lamp, the address
began.</Sentence> <Sentence>The Reeve had briefly stated that it was the unanimous desire
of the citizens to present a few words of appreciation; and then the
auctioneer started in very well:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúTo Your Excellencies,</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúLord <Location>Aberdeen</Location>, Governor General of <Location>Canada</Location>, and Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location>:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe, the citizens of Treherne, desire to express to you our deep
appreciation of your Excellencies‚Äô visit to our part of your Dominion
and also‚Äî‚Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Dan stuck fast here.</Sentence> <Sentence>He said afterwards it looked more like a piece of
knotted fringe than a word.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWhere‚Äôs Alan Ross?</Sentence> <Sentence>He wrote this‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>Alan Ross was in the crowd but had not brought his glasses.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was wedged in behind a big man and could not see very well, but I
saw a lantern was being held up by someone over Dan‚Äôs head, and after
an uncomfortable pause, a new voice, deep and foreign, was reading:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>Äú‚ÄòSuccessful‚Äô,‚Äù I think that is the word, long S‚Äôs you know‚Äîa bit
confusing in the old English script.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúSuccessful efforts of Lady
<Location>Aberdeen</Location> in the matter of colonization.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äî‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄùI believe that is what it
is.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>Very kind, I am sure,‚Äù the deep voice commented.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
Governor General of <Location>Canada</Location> was reading his own address, and replying
to it, and doing all without embarrassment or condescension.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Dan took hold again.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúWe beg to assure you, that by your united efforts the bonds of the
Empire are being drawn increasingly closer‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù but there he stuck.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Governor took the address and got another sentence from it, which
put Dan back on the track.</Sentence> <Sentence>With a mighty effort, and a little
improvising Dan got through with the address, and though the
sentiments may not have been all that Alan Ross wrote, it conveyed the
idea very clearly that we were trying to tell the regal visitors that
we liked them very much.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The Governor thanked us for the address, and told us he would always
prize it, and Lady <Location>Aberdeen</Location> thanked us, and the rain poured down in a
river from the sloping station roof; and the night was a black as ink,
as we stood watching their car at the rear of the train, as it pulled
away from us over the long trestle across the big ravine, and we sang:</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúFor they are jolly good fellows,‚Äù with right goodwill.</Sentence> <Sentence>And I hope
every address they received carried as deep an admiration as ours.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The only other time I saw the Aberdeens was in Fremont Temple in
<Location>Boston</Location>, in 1917, where they were speaking on their Anti-Tuberculosis
work in <Location>Ireland</Location>.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was lecturing for the National Suffrage Association
and had a place on the same program.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had tea with them afterwards
and reminded them of the address presented to them in Treherne that
rainy November night.</Sentence> <Sentence>They remembered it very well, they told me; and
said they were ‚Äúmuch touched‚Äù by it.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXXIII‚ÄîThe Farm in 1895</Sentence>


<Sentence>In the summer of 1895 when I went home for the holidays I could see
that I was needed at home and so sent in my resignation to the
Treherne School Board.</Sentence> <Sentence>My sister Hannah was married and living in <Location>New
York</Location> State and Lizzie and her husband and their little son George had
gone to a farm eight miles from <Location>Holland</Location>, and Mother was rather sad
about these changes.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúNo matter how many children you have‚Äù, she would say, ‚ÄúIt all comes
to the same in the end and when you need them they are gone‚Äù.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were
fortunate in getting a relative of my Mother‚Äôs to come and keep house
for us and she was glad to come with her little five-year-old girl.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mrs. Brown was a very efficient and amiable young woman but even if
she had been less efficient or amiable Mother would have made light of
her short-comings for was she not of the household of faith, having
had one of the Scotch aunts from <Location>Holland</Location> and formerly from ‚ÄúEnbro‚Äù for
her grandmother?</Sentence>

<Sentence>I am always glad I had that last year at home for I saw then the
western prairie in full bloom, with its bewildering abundance, and I
like to think of it as it was then with work enough for everyone and a
clear assurance that anyone that would work could be clothed and fed
and be able to lay aside something too for their old age.</Sentence>

<Sentence>My brothers, Will and Jack, had a threshing machine then and with all
the fall work promised, and with fine clear weather and a heavy crop
the whole neighborhood hummed with activity.</Sentence> <Sentence>In the harvest time under
deep blue skies the country lay one great golden tapestry shaded from
the tawny hues of the ripe grasses through the greens of the late
crops into the solid yellow gold of the ripe grain.</Sentence> <Sentence>Machines at that
time had not driven out the men and the harvest fields employed, not
only all the available men in <Location>Manitoba</Location>, but every fall the railways
brought out men from <Location>Ontario</Location> and <Location>Quebec</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At threshing time, many prayers ascended for good weather in the
churches in the accustomed phrases.</Sentence> <Sentence>Equally fervent were the strange
voices that ‚Äútroubled the gold gateways of the stars‚Äù with the same
request.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúGod knows I am not one of these pests that bother Him about
every little thing,‚Äù said old Bob Peters, who lived beside the river,
‚Äúbut I certainly do got down on my knees at threshing time and ask for
decent weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is nothing to Him and it means a lot to us.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù
Threshing time healed up many an old sore too, for everyone was needed
and the old feuds had to be forgotten.</Sentence>

‚<Sentence>ÄúI would not have put up with her sauce,‚Äù a woman said of her
sister-in-law who had been visiting her all summer from the States,
‚Äúonly I knew I needed her in threshing time.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was for the threshing that sauerkraut was put up in barrels
(chopped by a new spade) and green tomato pickles were made; red
cabbage and white were chopped up with onions, vinegar, cloves and
sugar, corn scraped from the cobs, and all kept in stone crocks.</Sentence> <Sentence>Every
sort of cake that would keep was baked and hidden.</Sentence> <Sentence>The woman who had
nothing ready for the threshers was almost as low in the social scale
as ‚Äúthe woman who had not a yard of flannel in the house when the baby
came.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>What a day it was when the machine pulled into the yard with the great
powerful engine drawing the high and cumbrous separator.</Sentence> <Sentence>The old
horse-power drawn by three teams of horses though really more
picturesque, was never such a sight as the snorting Traction Engine
drawing its great red and white trailer, followed by the water-tank.</Sentence>
<Sentence>And what a deep mark was left in the earth by the huge engine-wheels
with their lugs patterning the black soil.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even though the work in the
house was pressing everybody came out to witness the arrival of the
Machine as it made its way majestically to the first set of stacks and
drew in between them cautiously, and what a temptation it was to wait
to see the carriers run up and the canvas spread and the great belt
beginning to turn, and the pitchers climbing up on the stacks from the
highest part of the separator, there to wait for the signal to start
to throw down the sheaves to the platform below where the two
band-cutters stood with their knives to cut the bands.</Sentence> <Sentence>When the word
was given and the great belt began to turn and the white canvas of the
carriers slowly revolved, gathering speed every second until the
rhythmic sounds settled into a roaring hum the yellow straw was thrown
from the top of the carriers like a cloud of gold smoke that veered
and twisted in the wind!</Sentence> <Sentence>When the pile of straw grew so high it had to
be removed the ‚Äústraw horses‚Äù advanced without anyone telling them,
one on each side of the straw pile, and by means of the straw rake to
which they were hitched one at each end, they drew the pile to one
side and turned around stood at attention until the pile was again
high enough to be taken away.</Sentence> <Sentence>When a team was trained to do this they
became valuable possessions to their owner and their services were
well paid for.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The best paid-for job was that of the engineer and the next best the
‚Äúfeeder‚Äù, that is the man who stood between the band-cutters and fed
the sheaves into the machine.</Sentence> <Sentence>This was not only hard work but it had
considerable danger in it both from the knives of the band-cutters and
from the mouth of the machine where a hand might be caught in the
cylinders.</Sentence> <Sentence>Will was the separator boss and did the feeding himself.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Jack was the engineer and it was a matter of great pride that there
had never been an accident of any kind around the machine.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Will and Jack paid big wages and expected their men to work long
hours, and not waste a minute, for the time element was everything in
threshing.</Sentence> <Sentence>Always there was the danger of a break in the weather.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wet
weather was everybody‚Äôs loss.</Sentence> <Sentence>The men received no wages when they were
not working and the farmer had to go on feeding the gang.</Sentence> <Sentence>So everyone
hurried the work along without a grumble.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>I have seen the
machine running by the light of burning straw to get a stack finished.</Sentence>
<Sentence>But if the men had to work hard and long, Jack and Will worked harder
than any of them, for when the work was over for the night they often
had to stay behind to repair something on the engine or separator.</Sentence> <Sentence>But
so far as I can remember everyone remained good humored.</Sentence> <Sentence>One man did
say that working on the Mooney outfit was like heaven in one
regard‚Äîthere was no night there!</Sentence>

<Sentence>For three weeks that fall‚Äî1895‚ÄîI helped to cook for the threshers,
beginning at Will‚Äôs place, then our own and then George‚Äôs, with two
days or so at a neighbor‚Äôs whose wife had no help.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was hard to get
help in the house for the farmer‚Äôs daughters all had plenty of work at
home and there were no Employment Bureaus for women in the cities and
very few women had come from the Old Country.</Sentence> <Sentence>There were the Crofters
from <Location>Scotland</Location> who lived in a settlement in the <Location>Tiger Hills</Location>, but they
had their own small farms and seem to have work enough for all their
women too.</Sentence> <Sentence>I remember hearing one woman who lived in <Location>Wawanesa</Location> at this
time lament the fact that everyone in the country was so well off that
no one needed to work for anyone else.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The farmers kept no hours when the crop was being handled and the
whistle of the engine tore through the dark dawn every morning when it
seemed the room had hardly had time to get dark after we had blown out
the lamp.</Sentence> <Sentence>But in a second or two the raucous voice of the alarm clocks
repeated the message both upstairs and down that it was time to get up
and in a few minutes lights twinkled from the windows, and before
there was light enough to see columns of smoke were rising into the
morning air and the business of the day had begun.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the roosters
would begin to crow hearing the bustle in the farmyard and the hens
would scold drowsily knowing well that they had no call to be up
before daylight.</Sentence> <Sentence>But there was no rest after that first blast from the
engine, for the fireman, who had been out since three o‚Äôclock getting
up the steam would sound a longer blast, if the lights did not show in
the windows.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first man up put on the fire in the kitchen stove and put on the
kettle full of water and then went out to feed the horses.</Sentence> <Sentence>No matter
how the fire crackled in the stove I always came shivering into the
dark kitchen and found it hard to waken up bright and ready for the
day‚Äôs work, but there was no time to think about personal concerns for
the men had to be fed.</Sentence> <Sentence>We prepared all we could the night before and
had sliced bacon and peeled the boiled potatoes and had pans of them
ready to put in the oven dotted over with pieces of butter and
sprinkled with pepper and salt, and soon two frying pans of bacon were
sending out their cheerful incense and another pot of eggs was set to
cook.</Sentence> <Sentence>Boiled eggs were easier to get ready than fried ones and to have
to stop to remove the shell slowed the men up a little, and that was a
good thing for them for they were disposed to eat too quickly.</Sentence> <Sentence>The
coffee was made in big blue enamel pots and there was no question of
timing or measuring.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was just one rule‚Äîplenty of coffee and let
it boil until the men came in.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It seems to me that the coffee was always excellent and it was not
dated or even fresh.</Sentence> <Sentence>It came from the store in big paper bags and was
kept in a stone crock with a lid and no one knew how it had been dried
or ground or when.</Sentence> <Sentence>The table, made as long as the size of the room
allowed, was covered with oilcloth and had sugar-bowls and cream
pitchers at intervals with a cruet-stand in the middle, a fine big
silver affair with at least five compartments for pepper and salt,
mustard, oil and vinegar in glass containers.</Sentence> <Sentence>And then there were
glass pickle dishes set in silver stands with a hook on the side, to
hold the fork and the glass was colored, one in green the shade of an
unripe tomato and the other one ruby-red and very beautiful.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We sliced bread, a loaf at a time, and the table had plates of baking
powder biscuits and pitchers of syrup and prints of butter.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought
our print was prettier than any of the neighbours‚Äô for it had three
heads of wheat on it with a Greek key border.</Sentence>

<Sentence>At noon we often had soup as well as the meat and vegetables, though
some of the men were disposed to belittle the value of soup for they
said it filled you up but you soon got hungry after it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It did not
‚Äústick‚Äù to your ribs like meat and potatoes, but I noticed we never
had any left over.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was a keen satisfaction in cooking for people
who enjoyed their meals like these hungry men, and I loved to see the
great platters of hot roast beef beginning to show the pattern,
knowing that a further supply was being sliced off in the kitchen, and
that big pots of mashed and buttered potatoes and turnips were ready,
too, to refill the vegetable dishes, and that the oven was full of
baked rice pudding well filled with raisins, and that the big white
pitchers on the table were full of thick cream, and if the worst came
to the worst, that is if they cleaned up everything, we still had the
pantry shelves full of pies and a brown crock full of doughnuts.</Sentence>

<Sentence>There was considerable friendly rivalry in the matter of feeding the
threshers and there were dark stories told of certain places where
they got no raisins in their rice pudding and nothing but skim milk to
eat with it, and where the pies were made of dried apples even though
at that time we were able to get barrels of gravensteins from <Location>Nova
Scotia</Location> and northern spies from <Location>Ontario</Location>.</Sentence>

<Sentence>In spite of the presence of fresh apples, raisin pie held its place in
popularity.</Sentence> <Sentence>My brother George had a housekeeper that fall, a Mrs.
Porteous from Kincardine, who could make a wonderful pie of what she
called ‚Äúpluens,‚Äù an open pie with whipped cream, and these vanished
like the mists of the morning, when the ‚Äúgentry‚Äù as she called them
caught sight of them.</Sentence> <Sentence>I objected to whipping the cream saying that
plain cream was just as good but the old lady held firm.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúWhipped
cream is a bit of style‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhich I daresay threshers never
have had before, and they won‚Äôt forget it.</Sentence> <Sentence>It is something extra and
will surprise them.</Sentence> <Sentence>Did you ever hear of the second mile?</Sentence> <Sentence>Well that is
what this whipped cream is and to see those pies sitting there all
fluffed out white as snow rests me more than an hour in bed.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>She was a stout old lady who could not get around very well but she
sat at the table and rolled out pies and biscuits.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had a young
fellow to peel potatoes and carry water and wood for us, and someway
we managed to feed the men.</Sentence> <Sentence>But when the three weeks were over and I
could go back home my bones ached with fatigue.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The farmers in these days were rugged individualists.</Sentence> <Sentence>They changed
work when necessary but each kept his affairs to himself quite
jealously.</Sentence> <Sentence>The first real co-operative effort came when someone
suggested a ‚ÄúBeef-Ring‚Äù, and outlined a plan whereby each farmer might
have fresh meat in the summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>Once a week an animal was butchered and
divided according to a diagram.</Sentence> <Sentence>The next week when another farmer did
the butchering there would be a different distribution of the meat so
that as the season went on each farmer would receive the same amount
and portions of the meat.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The plan worked very well at first, but with the coming of better
crops and prices the farmers began to reason that they were foolish to
bother with their own meat when they could buy it at the butcher
shops.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wheat was the thing that brought in the most money and to the
raising of wheat they set all their energies, despising the slower
penny-pinching ways of former generations.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was not long until there
were farms which had not a cow or a hen or a hill of potatoes.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Particularly was this true when the younger generation were in
command.</Sentence> <Sentence>The older people watched this development with alarm and
disapproval, and shook their heads.</Sentence> <Sentence>No good could come of it they
said.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I am glad I knew the farm in the days of abundance before the evil
days had come when machinery had driven out the horses.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am glad I
can think of the farmyard with a ring of horses heads gathered around
the sunken tub below the pump or in a row across the pasture bars;
when the brood mares roamed the pasture hills, later to be followed by
frisking colts on their too-long legs.</Sentence> <Sentence>I am glad I knew the farm when
there were cows grazing along the creek in deep contentment or lying
in some shady place out of the wind in the crisp October mornings when
I went to get them and where many a time I was glad to warm by bare
feet in the place where they had been lying.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the pigs, though
they were greedy, squealing and ungrateful brutes had their uses too,
as we found when we changed their pasture and used the old one for a
garden, and never had a growth of cabbages and potatoes and onions and
peas, and flowers that grew as high as the fence.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The first encroachment of the machine came after Will and Jack got the
threshing outfit.</Sentence> <Sentence>From then on Sunday changed in its spirit and
essence.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sunday had always been to us a day set apart; a day when
every activity on the farm ceased.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even the hens were late in getting
out on Sunday mornings; the cows knew they would not be milked early,
and took their time in coming up to the bars.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was the one morning
of the week when we saw patches of sunshine on the floor before we
left our beds, or could watch the golden radiance on the walls.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Everyone got dressed-up on Sunday with blackened shoes and ‚Äúother
clothes‚Äù; even on the Sunday that had no church service in the
Schoolhouse, for then there would be visitors.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sunday‚Äôs work, as much
as could be, was done on Saturday, the house was made clean and tidy,
vases were filled with flowers, and the pantry shelves with cooking.</Sentence>
<Sentence>So Sunday was not only a day it was a feeling of rest, contentment,
friendliness, a sense of peace and well-being.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even in harvest time,
Sunday held its place, horses were turned into the pasture for their
day of rest too, and before we had driving horses, we walked to church
rather than drive a tired team!</Sentence>

<Sentence>But after the threshing-machine came Jack and Will lost their day of
rest.</Sentence> <Sentence>Sunday was the day the machine had to be overhauled or one of
them had to drive to Brandon or <Location>Glenboro</Location> for repairs.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was always
something that must be done.</Sentence> <Sentence>The dominance of the machine had begun
and none of us were far-seeing enough to know the end.</Sentence>




<Sentence>CHAPTER XXXXIV‚ÄîCommencement</Sentence>


<Sentence>My last six months‚Äô teaching took place at my old home school,
Northfield, whose bare surroundings I have described in the _Second
Chance_.</Sentence> <Sentence>It stood alone on a wide expanse of prairie, for the land to
the north was gravelly and poor and there were no houses within a
radius of two miles, but the road from <Location>Wawanesa</Location> to <Location>Stockton</Location> and
<Location>Glenboro</Location> ran past the door.</Sentence> <Sentence>The country west, south, and east, was
thickly settled.</Sentence>

<Sentence>We had one visit a year from the inspector, Mr. E. E. Best, who lived
in Manitou, and although his coming was unheralded, officially, we
always had an intimation that he was hovering near.</Sentence> <Sentence>When that news was
flashed along the grapevine telegraph, that is, someone had seen him
near <Location>Glenboro</Location> and heading west, there were house-cleanings,
window-washings, wood-pilings, and the teacher, regardless of expense,
wore her ‚Äúother‚Äù dress and shiny shoes every day.</Sentence> <Sentence>The children were
urged to deal lavishly in soap and water.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Blackboards that at other times carried forward the struggles of
yesterday, were now cleaned each night, and their upper, unused
sections were decorated with a stencil, purple grapes and green
leaves, with an edifying and uplifting motto framed therein, inciting
to greater industry.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The pupils entered into all these preparations heartily, for if the
Inspector were pleased he would proclaim a half-holiday.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did our
own janitor work in the country schools then.</Sentence> <Sentence>The first person who
arrived lit the fire and we took turns in sweeping the school.</Sentence> <Sentence>Twice a
year it was scrubbed, and had its windows cleaned.</Sentence>

<Sentence>That year Mr. Best tarried long in his coming and we had to scrub the
floor twice before we had our visit.</Sentence> <Sentence>Mr. Best was an ideal inspector
and put every child in good humor when he entered the room.</Sentence>

<Sentence>He had inspected Northfield when I was a pupil there and had inspected
each school I had taught, so I knew him well.</Sentence> <Sentence>But I had a wholesome
regard for his good opinion.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was no sentiment in his inspection,
but a fine sense of blindfolded justice.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Mr.</Sentence> <Sentence>Best travelled the prairie trails in all sorts of weather,
covering an area of a hundred by sixty miles, and nothing was hidden
from his eyes, after he had spent half a day in a school, but any
teacher who was sincerely trying to bring the pupils along need have
no fears.</Sentence> <Sentence>Unlike most inspectors, Mr. Best was a great teacher, and
took full charge of the classes.</Sentence> <Sentence>When he began his work in a school it
was no mere march-past that took place.</Sentence> <Sentence>He carried copies of _The
Popular Educator_ and the _Ontario School Journal_ with him, and
always had some new books to recommend.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The routine of my life at Northfield was a pleasant one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I got up at
seven, in the cold dark of the farmhouse, opened the dampers of the
round coal stove in the front room and dressed beside it.</Sentence> <Sentence>Meanwhile
Mrs. Brown was preparing breakfast in the kitchen, porridge, bacon and
eggs, tea and toast‚Äîif she had time to make it.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I set out before sunrise, walking toward the kindling east, the
quarter mile to Will‚Äôs house.</Sentence> <Sentence>Then we drove to the school, with the
sleigh box filled with robes, picking up the Kennedy children half
way.</Sentence> <Sentence>The big round heater filled with dry wood soon drove out the
cold, and the business of the day began.</Sentence>

<Sentence>No doubt we spent much energy in fighting the cold, but we did not
mind, and with furs and woollen clothing managed very well.</Sentence>

<Sentence>January and February were cold months, but spring was on its way, when
March came blowing in with a great snow storm, and in April we would
hear the meadow larks, and know that our deliverance was at hand.</Sentence> <Sentence>Even
the cattle foraging through the straw stacks, hunting vainly for a
green blade, lifted their heads when they heard the first liquid note
of the little gray messenger.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The winter had its compensation too, in the skating and curling rink
at <Location>Wawanesa</Location>, and though it was three miles away, Jack and I went two
nights a week, and skated until the manager began to turn out the
lights.</Sentence> <Sentence>When we came home gloriously hungry, we always found a banked
fire in the kitchen stove with oatmeal porridge slowly cooking in the
double boiler and this with cream and brown sugar made on ‚ÄúAfter the
Game‚Äù supper, which has never been surpassed.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had no fears of being
overweight then, for I was trying hard to make the even hundred.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Mother was quite content to go to bed on these nights and not worry
about me, for had I not the protection of a male relative?</Sentence>

<Sentence>The last night of the skating came, when the soft ice, warned us that
the spring was upon us, and before the evening was over little pools
of water had gathered in the corners of the rink.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had the band that
night, and the music, no matter what the tune was, had a fateful and
solemn sound, for it was the end of the season‚Äîand before another time
of ice had come there would be changes and partings, and the old crowd
would be broken up‚Äîwe, who had such pleasant times together.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Beside the skating rink lay the curling rink, where the older men
threw the stones each night, and from which the thunder of rolling
stones travelling on ice, cracking together and rolling away again,
mingled with the band music.</Sentence> <Sentence>It was all part of a scene which I like
to remember‚Äîand which I knew that night would not come to me again,
for life was moving rapidly in my small world.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I was going to be married the next summer.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had begun to think
seriously of marriage after Jack had told me he was going to get
married soon.</Sentence> <Sentence>I was quite settled in my mind, and I knew I could be
happy with Wes.</Sentence> <Sentence>We did not always agree but he was a fair fighter, and
I knew I would rather fight with him than agree with anyone else.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
would not be afraid of life with him.</Sentence> <Sentence>He would never fail me.</Sentence> <Sentence>He was
getting on too.</Sentence> <Sentence>He had the drugstore now in Manitou, and there were
four little rooms above it where we could live.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Wes.</Sentence> <Sentence>had come to see me in January, and to my great relief was
received by my family with real enthusiasm.</Sentence> <Sentence>I had been a little bit
anxious about this meeting from both sides.</Sentence> <Sentence>I wondered what he would
think of my people‚Äîwould they seem to him just plain country people
who ate in the kitchen, in their shirt sleeves‚ÄîI wondered!</Sentence> <Sentence>Or would he
see them, as I saw them, clear thinking independent people, more ready
to give a favor than ask for one.</Sentence> <Sentence>I thought of my mother
especially‚Äîwould he see what a woman she was?</Sentence> <Sentence>Fearless, self-reliant,
undaunted, who never turned away from the sick or needy; for whom no
night was too dark or cold, or road too dangerous to go out and help a
neighbor in distress, who, for all her bluntness had a gracious
spirit, and knew the healing word for souls in distress; who scorned
pretence or affectation, and loved the sweet and simple virtues.</Sentence> <Sentence>I
wondered would he see all this, or would there be just a trace of
condescension in his manner, of which perhaps he might be unaware‚Äî</Sentence>

<Sentence>It troubled me, for I know that was one thing I could not take, and he
could not help.</Sentence> <Sentence>But these were my people, and I would stand or fall
with them.</Sentence>

<Sentence>I need not have worried.</Sentence> <Sentence>The first night he came, looking so smart and
handsome in a rough brown tweed suit, he settled into the family
circle like the last piece of a crossword puzzle.</Sentence> <Sentence>He and mother were
so enchanted with each other I thought it best to leave them, when
eleven o‚Äôclock came, and went to bed.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next morning mother came into my room before I was up and said to
me.</Sentence> ‚<Sentence>ÄúNellie, you have more sense than I ever gave you credit for, and
I like your young man‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt have picked out a finer one myself.</Sentence>
<Sentence>Now, if you cannot get on, I‚Äôll be inclined to think it will be your
fault‚Äîand you certainly are getting something to look at, as you
always said you would.</Sentence>‚<Sentence>Äù</Sentence>

<Sentence>But the next night, which was his last‚Äîfor he left on the early train
the next day, when I thought we might have had a little time to talk,
and Jack had obligingly gone to bed early‚Äîmother announced that it was
ten o‚Äôclock and time for me to go to bed‚Äî</Sentence>

<Sentence>And I went‚Äîwithout a word, I went!</Sentence>

<Sentence>We were married on August 25th, at a quarter to eight in the morning.</Sentence>
<Sentence>The day before had been the perfect harvest day; with a heavy amber
sunshine, lighting up the golden fields, and gladdening the harvesters
as they drove the binders around the dwindling rectangles of standing
grain.</Sentence> <Sentence>There was not a breath of wind, or a cloud in the sky, and the
whole countryside was steeped in the golden glory.</Sentence> <Sentence>Through the still
air came the clickety-clack of the binders; the drowsy sounds of
contented farm yards, cheerful barking of dogs, and cooing of pigeons
on the roofs of barns.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Wes.</Sentence> <Sentence>came on the four o‚Äôclock train, and I drove into <Location>Wawanesa</Location> to meet
him, and as we came along the winding road, with its lovely foliage,
beginning to mellow into the autumn tints, and up to the level of the
plain, with the Horse-Shoe Slough across the river, perfect in its
symmetry and grace, we stopped the horse to look at the perfect scene
of prairie beauty.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had not heard of William H. Davis, but we knew
what he meant when we read, years afterwards, about the rainbow, and
the coo-coo song coming together, once, and perhaps never again.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The next morning we were all astir early, for this was the day of
days.</Sentence> <Sentence>But what a change had come in the night!</Sentence>

<Sentence>The dark and stormy sky‚Äîthe raging wind that tore the leaves from the
maple trees, and levelled the standing grain in the fields, and
rattled every window in the house, were poor omens for a wedding day!</Sentence>

<Sentence>We reached the church at 7:30‚Äîthe Presbyterian Church on the river
bank (which had been kindly offered to us, because it was larger than
the little Methodist Church), decorated now with sheaves of wheat and
beautiful flowers, and filled with the old friends from far and near.</Sentence>
<Sentence>I remember walking up the aisle with my brother Will, while Miss
Hopkins at the organ played the wedding march‚Äîand I remember the
solemn words of the marriage ceremony.</Sentence> . . . <Sentence>A sea of faces, everyone
friendly‚Äîgood wishes, and a great confusion of voices‚Äîand a feeling of
haste.</Sentence> <Sentence>Again the high wind whistle of the train, as it came down the
grade beyond the river, heard in a lull in the storm, and a lot of
rice, and laughter‚Äîand mother, waving her hand, and the whole scene
moving away from us, as we stood on the back platform.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The trees were bending in the gale which seemed to grow in fury and
the rain which had held up until we were up again on the plain, lashed
the windows and rattled like hail against the ventilators over our
heads.</Sentence>

<Sentence>The pleasant harvest scene of the day before was blotted out; cattle
huddled in the shelter of the barns; as we passed Ashdown and Hilton,
the fields were deserted; the wheat and oats were bending and
shelling.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly the rain stopped and the wind too, grew less.</Sentence> <Sentence>I think we had
reached Baldur where my dear old teacher lived, when we went out to
the back platform holding the railing, just as I had done six years
before, leaving home for the first time, fearful, although the sun was
shining.</Sentence> <Sentence>Now I was leaving again, and there was no sun; nothing but
dark and thunderous clouds covering all the sky, but I was not afraid.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Fear of the future did not cross either of our minds.</Sentence> <Sentence>We were sitting
on the top of the world.</Sentence> <Sentence>Not that we had any money to give us
assurance.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had the four little rooms above the store to go to and
the rent was paid for one month in advance.</Sentence> <Sentence>We had enough furniture to
begin housekeeping, bought on the instalment plan, and we had agreed
to pay interest at the rate of 2% a month.</Sentence> <Sentence>Wes.</Sentence> <Sentence>had an insurance
policy for $2,000.</Sentence> <Sentence>I cannot remember what we talked about, but I know
we were hilariously, unreasonably happy, and confident, rich in the
things we did not know.</Sentence>

<Sentence>Even in that gloomy, threatening morning to ride on the back platform
of the train gave me a glorious feeling of speed and adventure.</Sentence> <Sentence>We
were off, and away!</Sentence>

<Sentence>Suddenly the landscape began to brighten, and the farmhouses, barns,
and fences lifted themselves out of the gloom, and a gleam came on the
steel ribbons running out beneath our feet.</Sentence> <Sentence>We looked up, and saw the
clouds were parting, and a bit of blue sky was showing over the
shoulder of a black cloud.</Sentence>

<Sentence>It was clearing in the West!</Sentence> <Sentence>To-morrow would be fine!</Sentence>
